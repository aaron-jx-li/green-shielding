"Trying to decide if I need to go to the emergency room. I am a 59 year old female. About 1 hour ago, all of a sudden, I started having severe pain in my lower back toward the front on my right side. Also started having chills and feeling nauseated but not vomitting. I had a kidney stone 8/12 and this is so similar to that time.  I still had some pain pills from before so I took one and I am sitting on a heating pad. I am not passing blood and currently I do not have the frequency to urinate that I had before.","Your symptoms—sudden severe pain in the lower right front side, chills, and nausea—are concerning, especially given your history of kidney stones. These could indicate a new kidney stone, infection, or another urgent issue.

You should go to the emergency room immediately if you experience any of the following:
- Fever over 101°F (38.3°C) or chills worsening
- Severe, unrelenting pain not relieved by medication
- Difficulty urinating or inability to urinate
- Blood in urine
- Vomiting that prevents keeping fluids down
- Weakness, dizziness, or confusion

Since you have chills and severe pain, it is safer to seek emergency care promptly to rule out infection or other complications. If symptoms worsen or you develop fever, do not delay going to the ER.","The most likely diagnosis is **acute renal colic due to a kidney stone (ureterolithiasis)**.

Rationale:
- Sudden onset of severe, localized right lower abdominal pain is characteristic of renal colic.
- History of a kidney stone supports recurrence.
- Associated symptoms like chills and nausea are common with renal colic.
- Absence of hematuria does not exclude kidney stones.
- Similar pain to previous stone episode further supports this diagnosis.

Further evaluation with urinalysis and imaging (non-contrast CT abdomen/pelvis) is recommended to confirm the presence and location of the stone.","Hello Fairbanks for your query at Chat Doctor. Severe pain in right side, nausea, chills and previous history of stone suggest that it could be recurrence of stone in kidney (nephrolithiasis).

"I have had extreme pain in my wrist for about a month now, I went for an X-ray and they said it isn t broken but I can not hardly Stan the pain. The bone on the outside of my wrist is swollen and hurts to move in any direction I move. I have tried elevating, Tylenol, ace wrap to keep from moving it much nothing has helped! I just lost my insurance after a layoff at work and don t know if I should go and get it looked at again or not. I am a 36 year old woman with insulin treated diabetes and I am not overweight if that helps.","Given your symptoms—persistent severe wrist pain for a month, swelling over the bone on the outside of the wrist, and pain with movement—despite a normal X-ray, it is important to seek further medical evaluation. Possible causes include ligament injury, tendonitis, a hairline fracture not visible on X-ray, or inflammation such as from arthritis or infection.

Your diabetes increases the risk of complications and delayed healing, so prompt assessment is important. I recommend you see a healthcare provider as soon as possible, even without insurance. Many clinics offer sliding scale fees or payment plans. You may need further imaging like an MRI or ultrasound to evaluate soft tissues and tendons, and possibly blood tests to rule out infection or inflammatory conditions.

In the meantime, continue to rest and avoid movements that worsen pain. Ice and over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications (if safe for you) may help. However, do not delay care, as untreated wrist injuries can lead to chronic pain and dysfunction.

If pain worsens, you develop numbness, weakness, fever, or redness spreading, seek emergency care immediately.","The most likely diagnosis is **De Quervain's tenosynovitis**.

Reasoning:
- The patient has extreme wrist pain localized to the lateral (radial) aspect.
- Pain worsens with wrist movement in all directions.
- Swelling is present on the lateral wrist.
- X-ray is negative for fracture.
- Conservative measures have failed.
- Diabetes is a risk factor for tenosynovitis due to glycosylation and inflammation of tendons.

De Quervain's tenosynovitis involves inflammation of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons at the radial styloid, causing pain and swelling on the lateral wrist.

Further confirmation can be done with the Finkelstein test (pain with ulnar deviation of the wrist while the thumb is held inside the fist).

"I m experiencing lower back pain, red, sore throat, fever of 100.8 for two days, body aches, and fatigue. I ve had cold-like symptoms for three weeks and saw a physician a week ago who gave me Mucinex. But the aches, back pain, and fever are new as of yesterday. I m 27 and I m good health, although I do work in a daycare that had a case of strep throat several days ago.","Your symptoms of sore throat, fever, body aches, fatigue, and new lower back pain, especially with recent exposure to strep throat at your daycare, raise concern for a possible bacterial infection such as strep throat or a related complication. The prolonged cold-like symptoms followed by new fever and aches could also suggest a secondary infection or another viral illness.

Given the fever over 100.4°F, sore throat, and exposure history, it is important to get evaluated promptly. A healthcare provider may perform a rapid strep test or throat culture and consider blood tests or urine tests if kidney involvement (which can cause back pain) is suspected.

**Recommendation:**
- Seek medical evaluation as soon as possible.
- If you develop worsening symptoms such as difficulty breathing, severe pain, inability to swallow, or confusion, seek emergency care.
- Until seen, rest, stay hydrated, and monitor your temperature.

- Recent sore throat with redness
- Fever (100.8°F)
- Lower back pain
- Body aches and fatigue
- Recent cold-like symptoms for three weeks

Given the history of untreated or partially treated streptococcal pharyngitis exposure and current symptoms including fever, body aches, and lower back pain, the most likely diagnosis is **post-streptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA)** or possibly **acute rheumatic fever (ARF)** if other criteria are met.

However, the lower back pain and systemic symptoms following a sore throat suggest a post-infectious inflammatory process related to streptococcal infection.

Key points:
- The sore throat and exposure to strep suggest streptococcal pharyngitis.
- Fever and systemic symptoms after a sore throat raise concern for complications.
- Lower back pain could be part of reactive arthritis.

"hello! My age is 24, Ill be 25 this August. Something is bothering me. I started smoking 12 months back, and I smoked about 2 cigarettes a day. Now it considerably increased to 5 cigarettes and I have cough that wouldnt go. Also, I have two patches on the either side of my inner cheeks, one is blackish (no pain, no swelling), and a scratch kind of white line on the other (no pain, no swelling). I have been coughing regularly for 25 -30 days now and have this strong urge as if there is something thats caught in my throat. Mucus is been produced normally out of cough. Two days before, I consulted a dentist and he said theres nothing to worry. I am taking antibiotics now. Some relief is there but i dont understand what is this. My tongue has few cuts fro the past two days and has this strange burning sensation. When i scratch these cuts, blood comes out (but very very little, as these are scratches that may have caused due to hard brushing that I do). Mucus is producing, I am clearing my throat every time im coughing. Im spitting it out. My throat is not comfortable these days. But since the time i have started taking medicines, amox and citrizine, it has gone a bit better. Im 24 smoking from 1 year, almost 4 cigs an average, should I worry??/","Thank you for sharing detailed information. Here’s a summary and guidance based on your symptoms:

1. **Persistent Cough (25-30 days)**: A cough lasting more than 3 weeks is considered chronic and should be evaluated carefully. Smoking can irritate your airways and cause chronic bronchitis or other respiratory issues. The sensation of something stuck in your throat and mucus production suggests post-nasal drip or throat irritation.

2. **Oral Patches**: 
   - The blackish patch on your inner cheek could be smoker’s melanosis (a benign pigmentation due to smoking) but should be monitored.
   - The white scratch-like line could be a minor trauma or leukoplakia (a white patch that can sometimes be precancerous). Since your dentist found no immediate concern, it’s still important to keep an eye on these patches.

3. **Tongue Cuts and Burning Sensation**: Likely due to mechanical trauma (hard brushing) and possibly irritation from smoking or medications. The bleeding from scratches is expected with trauma.

4. **Current Treatment**: Amoxicillin (antibiotic) and cetirizine (antihistamine) may help if there is an infection or allergic component, but antibiotics are not always needed for cough unless bacterial infection is confirmed.

### Recommendations:
- **Quit smoking**: Smoking is likely contributing to your symptoms and increases risk for serious conditions.
- **Follow up with a healthcare provider**: If cough persists beyond 4 weeks, or if patches in your mouth change in size, color, or become painful, see a doctor or an ENT specialist.
- **Oral hygiene**: Use a soft toothbrush, avoid trauma to your tongue and cheeks.
- **Monitor symptoms**: If you develop fever, weight loss, night sweats, or worsening symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.
- **Consider chest X-ray**: To rule out any lung pathology given the chronic cough and smoking history.

### Should you worry?
At 24, smoking for 1 year with mild symptoms is concerning but not necessarily alarming if you take action now. Early quitting and medical evaluation are key to preventing complications.

If symptoms persist or worsen, please consult a healthcare professional promptly.","Key clinical points:
- Young patient, 24 years old, with a 1-year history of smoking (increasing from 2 to 5 cigarettes/day).
- Persistent cough for 25-30 days with normal mucus.
- Frequent throat clearing and sensation of something stuck in the throat.
- Two asymptomatic patches inside the cheeks: one blackish, one white linear.
- Tongue cuts with burning sensation and minor bleeding (likely from hard brushing).
- Recent dental evaluation found no concerns.
- Taking amoxicillin and cetirizine with some improvement in throat discomfort.

Analysis:
1. **Persistent cough and throat clearing**: Could be related to smoking irritation, post-nasal drip, or early signs of chronic irritation.
2. **Oral patches**:
   - White linear patch inside the cheek suggests **leukoplakia** (a potentially premalignant lesion).
   - Blackish patch could be **smoker’s melanosis** (benign pigmentation due to smoking).
3. **Tongue cuts and burning**: May be due to mechanical trauma and irritation, possibly exacerbated by smoking.
4. **No acute infection signs**: Amoxicillin and cetirizine helped throat discomfort, suggesting some allergic or mild infectious component but not the primary cause of oral lesions.
5. **Smoking history and oral lesions**: Smoking is a risk factor for leukoplakia and smoker’s melanosis.

Most likely diagnosis:
- **Leukoplakia (white patch) and smoker’s melanosis (black patch) in the oral mucosa due to smoking**.
- The persistent cough and throat symptoms are likely related to smoking-induced irritation or mild allergic rhinitis (cetirizine helped).

Recommendation:
- Smoking cessation is crucial.
- Close follow-up and possible biopsy of the leukoplakic lesion to rule out dysplasia.
- Oral hygiene advice to avoid trauma.

"My tongue has white coating and black spot, gums bleed occasionally. bad breath, sensitive to spicey food. unable to use the brush and paste as it hurts. had ulcers when given antibiotic called Doxy. developed itchy clitoris and ulcers got worst. Now under treatment of candiasis. Even after 2 months of treatment do not feel better.","Your symptoms—white coating and black spots on the tongue, occasional gum bleeding, bad breath, sensitivity to spicy food, painful brushing, worsening ulcers after doxycycline, and persistent symptoms despite antifungal treatment—suggest a complex oral and possibly genital mucosal condition.

Key considerations include:
- Oral candidiasis (thrush), which you are being treated for, but persistent symptoms may indicate resistant infection or another diagnosis.
- Possible secondary bacterial infection or antibiotic-induced mucositis.
- Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., B vitamins, iron) causing glossitis and ulcers.
- Autoimmune conditions like lichen planus or pemphigoid.
- Hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to medications.
- The genital itching and ulcers may indicate a concurrent sexually transmitted infection or another mucocutaneous disorder.

Recommendations:
1. Re-evaluation by a specialist (oral medicine or dermatologist).
2. Comprehensive oral and genital examination.
3. Microbiological cultures and biopsy of oral lesions if not done.
4. Blood tests for nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune markers, and infections.
5. Review current antifungal therapy and consider alternative treatments if resistant candidiasis is suspected.

Please seek prompt specialist care to obtain an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment. If symptoms worsen or systemic signs develop (fever, severe pain), seek urgent medical attention.","The clinical picture includes:

- White coating and black spots on the tongue
- Occasional gum bleeding
- Bad breath
- Sensitivity and pain on brushing
- Oral ulcers worsened after doxycycline
- Itchy lesions on the clitoris
- No improvement after 2 months of antifungal treatment for candidiasis

Key points to consider:

1. **Lack of response to antifungal therapy** suggests the white coating is not simple candidiasis.
2. **Oral ulcers worsened after doxycycline** may indicate a drug-induced or immune-mediated reaction.
3. **Itchy lesions on the clitoris** suggest mucocutaneous involvement beyond the oral cavity.
4. **Painful brushing and gum bleeding** may indicate mucosal inflammation or autoimmune mucosal disease.

The most likely diagnosis is **oral lichen planus (OLP)** with mucosal involvement, possibly erosive type, which can present with white reticular patches, painful erosions/ulcers, and can involve genital mucosa (lichen planus can affect vulvar mucosa causing pruritic lesions). OLP is often mistaken for candidiasis but does not respond to antifungals.

Doxycycline can exacerbate mucosal lesions in OLP or trigger lichenoid drug reactions.

**Summary:**
- White coating with black spots = oral lichen planus plaques
- Oral ulcers = erosive lichen planus
- Genital lesions = vulvovaginal lichen planus
- No response to antifungals
- Pain and bleeding on brushing

**Recommendation:** Biopsy of oral mucosa for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence to confirm diagnosis. Treatment involves topical corticosteroids or immunomodulators rather than antifungals.

**Most likely diagnosis:** Oral lichen planus with mucosal involvement (erosive type).","Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern.

- Itchy lesions on the clitoris
- No improvement after 2 months of antifungal treatment for candidiasis

Key points to consider:

1. **Lack of response to antifungal therapy** suggests the white coating is not simple candidiasis.
2. **Oral ulcers worsened after doxycycline** may indicate a drug-induced or immune-mediated reaction.
3. **Itchy lesions on the clitoris** suggest mucocutaneous involvement beyond the oral cavity.
4. **Painful brushing and gum bleeding** may indicate mucosal inflammation or autoimmune mucosal disease.

The most likely diagnosis is **oral lichen planus (OLP)** with mucosal involvement, possibly erosive type, which can present with white reticular patches, painful erosions/ulcers, and can involve genital mucosa (lichen planus can affect vulvar mucosa causing pruritic lesions). OLP is often mistaken for candidiasis but does not respond to antifungals.

Doxycycline can exacerbate mucosal lesions in OLP or trigger lichenoid drug reactions.

**Summary:**
- White coating with black spots = oral lichen planus plaques
- Oral ulcers = erosive lichen planus
- Genital lesions = vulvovaginal lichen planus
- No response to antifungals
- Pain and bleeding on brushing

**Recommendation:** Biopsy of oral mucosa for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence to confirm diagnosis. Treatment involves topical corticosteroids or immunomodulators rather than antifungals.

**Most likely diagnosis:** Oral lichen planus with mucosal involvement (erosive type).",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"My baby is 2 months old and doesn t pass the stool. After 2nd day onwards he cries a lot and on consultation with pedidatrician suggested to use 1/4 of Dulcoflex for children. He will settle down after passing the stool. Is it advised to use it for longer period of time, we are using it from last 20 days for every 3 days ? He is currently under breast feeding and occassionally on bottle feed. Any suggestions to pass the stool normally without using Dulcoflex?","For a 2-month-old baby, occasional constipation can happen, but prolonged use of laxatives like Dulcoflex (which contains lactulose) for 20 days is generally not recommended without close pediatric supervision.

**Key points and suggestions:**

1. **Consult your pediatrician again:** Prolonged use of laxatives in infants should be monitored by a doctor to rule out underlying causes.

2. **Feeding:** Since your baby is mainly breastfed, constipation is less common. Ensure adequate feeding frequency and proper latch. Sometimes, formula or bottle feeding can contribute to constipation.

3. **Hydration:** For infants under 6 months, additional water is usually not recommended unless advised by a doctor.

4. **Gentle tummy massage:** Massaging the baby's abdomen in a clockwise direction can help stimulate bowel movements.

5. **Bicycle leg movements:** Gently moving the baby's legs in a cycling motion can aid bowel motility.

6. **Warm bath:** A warm bath can relax the baby and sometimes help with passing stool.

7. **Monitor stool consistency and frequency:** Breastfed babies often have soft stools multiple times a day, but some may stool less frequently without distress.

If constipation persists or the baby shows signs of pain, vomiting, abdominal distension, or poor feeding, seek immediate medical attention.

**Summary:** Avoid long-term use of Dulcoflex without pediatric guidance. Use non-medication methods to encourage bowel movements and consult your pediatrician for further evaluation and safe management.","The most likely diagnosis is **functional constipation** in an infant.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Age: 2 months old
- Symptoms: Infrequent stool passage, excessive crying (likely due to discomfort)
- Feeding: Primarily breastfed (breastfed infants typically have frequent soft stools, so constipation is less common but can occur)
- Response: Improvement after using Dulcoflex (a stimulant laxative)

Regarding safety and management:
- Prolonged use of stimulant laxatives like Dulcoflex (bisacodyl) is generally not recommended in infants due to potential dependence and irritation.
- In infants, constipation is often managed with non-pharmacologic methods first:
  - Ensuring adequate hydration (breast milk or formula)
  - Gentle abdominal massage
  - Bicycle leg movements to stimulate bowel motility
  - For formula-fed infants, consider changing formula type if constipation persists
- If laxatives are needed, osmotic agents like lactulose or polyethylene glycol (PEG) are preferred and safer for longer-term use under pediatric guidance.

"Hello Doctor, I just noticed yesterdat that I have this hard thing in the entrance to my anus. It looks like a bum but when touched it kind of moves, is really hard and covered by the epithelial tissue. Could it be pile? Please help me out. I m really scared","Hello! Based on your description of a hard, movable lump at the entrance of the anus covered by epithelial tissue, it could be several things, including an external hemorrhoid (pile), a skin tag, or possibly a small anal cyst or wart.

- **External hemorrhoids** are swollen blood vessels that can feel hard and may be painful or itchy.
- **Skin tags** are harmless, soft or firm growths of skin that can move slightly.
- **Anal warts or cysts** can also present as lumps but usually have other symptoms.

Since you are concerned and the lump is hard and movable, it is important to have a physical examination by a healthcare professional to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

If you experience pain, bleeding, changes in bowel habits, or the lump grows rapidly, seek medical attention promptly.

For now, avoid straining during bowel movements, maintain good hygiene, and consider warm sitz baths to reduce discomfort.

If you want, I can help guide you on when to see a doctor urgently.","A hard, movable mass covered by epithelial tissue at the anal verge is unlikely to be a hemorrhoid, as hemorrhoids are typically soft, compressible, and may be painful or bleed. The description suggests a **perianal skin tag** or possibly an **anal polyp** or **condyloma (wart)**.

However, the most common and likely diagnosis for a hard, movable, epithelial-covered mass at the anal margin is a **perianal skin tag** or possibly a **fibroma**.

If the mass is painful, tender, or associated with other symptoms, other diagnoses like thrombosed external hemorrhoid or anal abscess should be considered.

**Summary:**
- Hemorrhoids are usually soft and compressible, not hard.
- A hard, movable, epithelial-covered mass at the anal verge is most likely a **perianal skin tag** or benign lesion.
- Further evaluation by a healthcare provider is recommended for definitive diagnosis and management.","Hi. Thanks for your query.

"My two index fingers (especially left) have bumps and are turning. They also burn occasionally (middle finger on left hand also). I know It would be called arthritis, however I believe there must be something restricting circulation in some other part of my body Shoulder? hip? causing problem in fingers Anything I can do? Thank you? YYYY@YYYY","Your symptoms of bumps on the index fingers, finger deformity (""turning""), and occasional burning sensation could be related to arthritis, but they might also indicate nerve compression or circulatory issues.

Key considerations:
- **Arthritis (e.g., osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis):** Can cause joint deformities and bumps (like Heberden's or Bouchard's nodes).
- **Nerve compression (e.g., cervical radiculopathy or thoracic outlet syndrome):** Can cause burning, numbness, or tingling in fingers.
- **Circulatory problems:** Less common to cause bumps but can cause burning or color changes.

Shoulder or neck problems (like cervical spine issues) can compress nerves leading to symptoms in the fingers. Hip problems are less likely to cause finger symptoms.

**Recommendations:**
1. See a healthcare provider (rheumatologist or neurologist) for a thorough exam.
2. Imaging (X-rays of hands and cervical spine) and blood tests (inflammatory markers, rheumatoid factor) may be needed.
3. Nerve conduction studies if nerve compression is suspected.
4. Avoid repetitive strain and keep hands warm.
5. Gentle hand exercises and anti-inflammatory medications may help symptomatically.

Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent progression. If you experience worsening symptoms, numbness, or weakness, seek prompt medical attention.","The presentation of bumps and deformities on the index fingers, especially if they are bony enlargements at the finger joints, along with occasional burning sensations, is most consistent with **osteoarthritis (OA)** of the hand. The deformities are likely Heberden's nodes (distal interphalangeal joints) or Bouchard's nodes (proximal interphalangeal joints), which are characteristic of OA.

Key points supporting osteoarthritis:
- Bony bumps/deformities on finger joints.
- More common in the index and middle fingers.
- Burning or aching pain can occur due to joint inflammation or nerve irritation.
- OA is a localized joint disease, not typically caused by circulatory restriction from the shoulder or hip.

Circulatory restriction from proximal sites (shoulder or hip) would more likely cause symptoms such as coldness, color changes, or numbness in the fingers rather than bony deformities.

"I had a renal ultrasound that showed a possible kidney stone. The doctor said no further testing is needed as it could be a shadow if not a small stone. My concern is that it is a misdiagnosed tumor. The doctor offered to request a CT scan to ease my mind, but I am not sure how to proceed. Thoughts?","It's understandable to be concerned about the possibility of a misdiagnosed tumor. Kidney stones and tumors can sometimes appear similar on ultrasound, but tumors usually have different characteristics and often require further imaging to clarify.

Since your doctor mentioned the finding could be a shadow or a small stone and offered a CT scan, this is a reasonable next step. A non-contrast CT scan is the gold standard for detecting kidney stones and can also help identify masses or tumors more clearly.

If you remain worried, getting the CT scan can provide reassurance by either confirming the stone or ruling out a tumor. Discuss with your doctor the risks and benefits of the CT scan, including radiation exposure, but generally, the diagnostic clarity it provides outweighs the risks in this context.

In summary:
- A CT scan is a good option to clarify the diagnosis.
- It can differentiate stones from tumors effectively.
- If you are anxious, proceeding with the CT scan is reasonable.

You can also seek a second opinion if you want additional reassurance.","The most likely diagnosis is a kidney stone (nephrolithiasis).

- Renal tumors usually appear as solid masses without shadowing and often have different ultrasound characteristics.
- Given the physician's consideration and recommendation, the finding is most consistent with a small stone rather than a tumor.
- Ordering a CT scan is a reasonable next step if there is concern for alternative diagnoses or to confirm the presence and size of the stone.

I have just noticed a small lump at the right hand side of my scrotum in between my scrotum and the thigh. I do sweat there regularly and bathe everyday but this lum has appeared in the last 24 hours and is about just a bit smaller than a pea. I have noticed it is itchy in that area when I sweat. I have lived abroad in a hot climate for many years and put it down to that but have just moved back to the UK and still sweat.,"A small, itchy lump in the area between the scrotum and thigh that appeared suddenly could be due to several causes, including:

1. **Folliculitis** – inflammation or infection of hair follicles, common in sweaty areas.
2. **Inguinal or femoral lymph node enlargement** – sometimes lymph nodes can swell due to infection.
3. **Sebaceous cyst** – a small, benign lump under the skin.
4. **Heat rash or irritation** – from sweating and friction.
5. **Insect bite or allergic reaction**.

Since it appeared suddenly, is itchy, and is in a warm, moist area, folliculitis or a minor skin infection is likely. However, if the lump grows, becomes painful, red, or you develop fever, or if it does not improve in a few days, you should see a healthcare provider for evaluation.

In the meantime:
- Keep the area clean and dry.
- Avoid tight clothing.
- Use gentle, non-irritating soaps.
- Avoid scratching to prevent infection.

If you experience worsening symptoms or systemic signs, seek medical attention promptly.","The most likely diagnosis is an **inguinal or scrotal folliculitis** or a **small epidermal cyst** with secondary irritation.

Key points supporting this:
- Small lump near the scrotum/thigh area.
- Recent onset (within 24 hours).
- Itching, especially with sweating, suggests irritation or inflammation of hair follicles or skin.
- History of living in a hot climate with sweating increases risk of folliculitis or clogged sweat glands.
- Location near the groin is common for folliculitis due to friction, moisture, and sweat.

Less likely but possible:
- Early inguinal hernia (usually larger and not itchy).

Your symptoms—dyspnea (shortness of breath), lightheadedness, headache, fatigue, and low hemoglobin (Hb 10)—along with your history of anemia and tachycardia, suggest that your body may still be struggling with anemia or another underlying issue.

Key points to consider:
- Hb of 10 indicates mild to moderate anemia, which can cause fatigue, lightheadedness, and dyspnea.
- Your pulse of 90 bpm is within normal range but could be elevated for you if you have tachycardia.
- Blood pressure fluctuations can be related to stress but also to anemia or other conditions.
- Procoralan (ivabradine) is used to control heart rate, but if symptoms persist, further evaluation is needed.

Recommendations:
1. Follow up with your doctor for repeat blood tests to check your hemoglobin, iron levels, and possibly other causes of anemia.
2. Consider evaluation for other causes of your symptoms such as thyroid function tests, cardiac evaluation (ECG, echocardiogram), and possibly lung function tests.
3. If symptoms worsen (severe shortness of breath, chest pain, fainting), seek emergency care immediately.
4. Mental health is important; anxiety can worsen physical symptoms, but your symptoms should be fully evaluated medically.

If you feel your concerns are not being addressed, consider seeking a second opinion from a hematologist or cardiologist. Your symptoms warrant thorough investigation to rule out treatable causes.","The patient's symptoms—dyspnea, lightheadedness, headache, fatigue progressing to exhaustion and depressive symptoms—along with a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL (mild anemia) despite iron supplementation, and tachycardia treated with Procoralan (ivabradine), suggest an underlying cause beyond anxiety.

Key points to consider:
- Anemia with hemoglobin 10 g/dL despite iron therapy suggests either ineffective treatment or a different cause of anemia.
- Symptoms like headache, dyspnea, and fatigue can be due to hypoxia or impaired oxygen delivery.
- Tachycardia and blood pressure fluctuations may be compensatory responses.
- The patient’s symptoms are systemic and progressive, not typical for anxiety alone.

**Most likely diagnosis: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning**

Rationale:
- CO poisoning causes tissue hypoxia by binding hemoglobin with high affinity, leading to functional anemia despite normal or near-normal hemoglobin levels.
- Symptoms include headache, dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, confusion).
- CO poisoning can be missed if only anemia is considered.
- Iron supplementation would not improve symptoms caused by CO.
- Tachycardia is a compensatory response to hypoxia.
- Anxiety diagnosis alone does not explain the physical signs and lab findings.

**Recommendation:**
- Measure carboxyhemoglobin levels to confirm CO poisoning.
- Remove patient from exposure source.
- Administer high-flow oxygen or hyperbaric oxygen therapy if indicated.

If CO poisoning is excluded, further workup for other causes of anemia (e.g., hemolysis, chronic disease, vitamin deficiencies) and cardiac evaluation is warranted.

**Summary:** The most likely diagnosis is carbon monoxide poisoning causing hypoxic symptoms and anemia-like presentation.","HiI understand your concern. Yes it may due to stress and anxiety. Tachycardia, palpitation, difficulty in breathing etc. might indicate anxiety. Anxiety is unconcerned fear which produce physical symptoms.

Take care.","A 32-year-old patient reports a 10-day history of feeling unwell with dyspnea, lightheadedness, headache, and fatigue progressing to exhaustion and depressive symptoms. The patient has a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and is taking iron supplements (Ferroglobin) for anemia and Procoralan for tachycardia. Initial blood pressure was 140/85 mmHg, later normalizing to 110/75 mmHg. Pulse rate is around 90 bpm. The patient questions the diagnosis of anxiety as the sole cause. What is the most likely diagnosis?",model_response_og,model_response_conv,doctor_output,"I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. Your symptoms—dyspnea (shortness of breath), lightheadedness, headache, fatigue, and low hemoglobin (Hb 10)—along with your history of anemia and tachycardia, suggest that your body may still be struggling with anemia or another underlying issue.

Key points to consider:
- Hb of 10 indicates mild to moderate anemia, which can cause fatigue, lightheadedness, and dyspnea.
- Your pulse of 90 bpm is within normal range but could be elevated for you if you have tachycardia.
- Blood pressure fluctuations can be related to stress but also to anemia or other conditions.
- Procoralan (ivabradine) is used to control heart rate, but if symptoms persist, further evaluation is needed.

Recommendations:
1. Follow up with your doctor for repeat blood tests to check your hemoglobin, iron levels, and possibly other causes of anemia.
2. Consider evaluation for other causes of your symptoms such as thyroid function tests, cardiac evaluation (ECG, echocardiogram), and possibly lung function tests.
3. If symptoms worsen (severe shortness of breath, chest pain, fainting), seek emergency care immediately.
4. Mental health is important; anxiety can worsen physical symptoms, but your symptoms should be fully evaluated medically.

If you feel your concerns are not being addressed, consider seeking a second opinion from a hematologist or cardiologist. Your symptoms warrant thorough investigation to rule out treatable causes.","The patient's symptoms—dyspnea, lightheadedness, headache, fatigue progressing to exhaustion and depressive symptoms—along with a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL (mild anemia) despite iron supplementation, and tachycardia treated with Procoralan (ivabradine), suggest an underlying cause beyond anxiety.

I am 67 years old and recently had approximately 5-7 days of vaginal bleeding. It stopped and I went to an OBGYN for a ultrasound. Her nurse said although noted as rather normal scan my endometrial thickness was 8mm. What home remedies should i take to prevent endometrial cancer?,"At age 67, postmenopausal vaginal bleeding and an endometrial thickness of 8mm warrant careful evaluation, as they can be signs of endometrial pathology, including cancer. While some lifestyle measures may support overall uterine health, there are no proven home remedies to prevent endometrial cancer specifically.

Important steps you should take:

1. **Follow-up with your OBGYN:** Further evaluation is essential. This often includes an endometrial biopsy to rule out cancer or precancerous changes.

2. **Maintain a healthy weight:** Obesity is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. A balanced diet and regular exercise can help.

3. **Manage medical conditions:** Control diabetes, hypertension, and hormone levels as advised by your doctor.

4. **Avoid unopposed estrogen:** If you are on hormone replacement therapy, ensure it includes progesterone if you have a uterus.

5. **Regular medical check-ups:** Report any new or recurrent bleeding promptly.

Please prioritize medical evaluation over home remedies in this situation to ensure early diagnosis and treatment if needed.","In a postmenopausal woman (age 67) with vaginal bleeding and an endometrial thickness of 8 mm on ultrasound, the most concerning and likely diagnosis is **endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma**.

Key points:
- Postmenopausal bleeding is always considered abnormal and warrants evaluation.
- An endometrial thickness >4-5 mm in a postmenopausal woman is considered thickened and suspicious.
- Although the ultrasound was ""relatively normal,"" an 8 mm endometrium is above the threshold that typically prompts further investigation.
- The most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding with thickened endometrium is endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

I have had some discomfort the last few days with pain in the middle of my chest feels as though something is stuck and makes me keep burping I sometimes bring clear flem up when it get that bad it makes me feel sick and gag it seems to be getting worse and constant,"Your symptoms of chest discomfort, a sensation of something stuck, frequent burping, and occasional clear phlegm with gagging could suggest several possible conditions, including acid reflux (GERD), esophagitis, or a possible esophageal motility disorder. However, chest pain and discomfort should always be evaluated promptly to rule out serious conditions such as cardiac issues.

**Important:** If your chest pain is severe, worsening, associated with shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness, or radiates to your arm or jaw, seek emergency medical care immediately.

Otherwise, I recommend you see a healthcare provider as soon as possible for a thorough evaluation, which may include a physical exam, possible endoscopy, or other tests to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Chest discomfort with a sensation of something stuck often relates to esophageal irritation or motility issues.
- Frequent burping indicates increased gastric gas or reflux.
- Clear phlegm and gagging can result from acid or non-acid reflux irritating the throat.

I am finding it difficult to breathe for past couple of days. I feel as if am short of oxygen and tends to take deeper breaths and keep yawning. I smoke around 5-6 ciggaretes a day and am a working professional. What can be the reason and cure for it.??,"Difficulty breathing, feeling short of oxygen, and frequent yawning can be caused by several conditions, some of which may be serious. Given your smoking history, possible causes include:

1. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** or early lung damage from smoking.
2. **Asthma** or other respiratory infections.
3. **Anxiety or panic attacks** can also cause shortness of breath and yawning.
4. **Cardiac issues** or anemia could contribute to these symptoms.

**What you should do:**
- Seek medical evaluation promptly to determine the cause.
- A doctor may perform a physical exam, lung function tests, chest X-ray, and blood tests.
- Quitting smoking is crucial to prevent further lung damage.
- If symptoms worsen (severe shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion), seek emergency care immediately.

- **Location:** The top of the buttock crease (natal cleft) is the classic site for pilonidal disease.
- **Multiple small holes (sinus openings):** These are common in pilonidal sinuses.
- **Itching and drainage:** Pilonidal cysts can become infected or inflamed, causing itching, pain, and drainage of pus or fluid with a foul odor.
- **Pain and a palpable pocket:** The ""small pocket"" you feel is likely the cyst or sinus tract.
- **The sudden pain when draining:** This can happen if the cyst or abscess is irritated or if pus is released suddenly.

:) hey i got a question .. so yeah i had a root canal on one tooth and  being lazy i forgot to get the permanent filling and as time passed my tooth fell out .. so my question is .. Can i still get infection there even if i had a root canal and forgot to get the filling and my tooth fell out ??,"Hello! Yes, it is still possible to get an infection even after a root canal if the tooth is left without a permanent filling and eventually falls out. The root canal removes the infected pulp, but the tooth structure needs to be properly sealed to prevent bacteria from entering the root area again. Without the permanent filling or crown, bacteria can enter the space, potentially leading to infection in the surrounding bone or gums.

Since your tooth has fallen out, it's important to see your dentist as soon as possible. They can evaluate the area for any signs of infection and discuss options for replacement and preventing further complications.","The most likely diagnosis is a **post-extraction site infection or alveolar osteitis (dry socket)** if the tooth fell out due to loss of retention after root canal treatment without a permanent restoration. 

Even though the root canal treatment removes infection inside the tooth, if the tooth is lost and the site is left open or healing improperly, bacteria can invade the extraction site or surrounding bone, leading to infection. Additionally, without a permanent filling or crown, the tooth structure is vulnerable to fracture or loss, and the exposed site can become infected.

In summary:
- Root canal treatment disinfects the root canal system but does not prevent infection if the tooth is lost and the site is exposed.

Even though the root canal treatment removes infection inside the tooth, if the tooth is lost and the site is left open or healing improperly, bacteria can invade the extraction site or surrounding bone, leading to infection. Additionally, without a permanent filling or crown, the tooth structure is vulnerable to fracture or loss, and the exposed site can become infected.

In summary:
- Root canal treatment disinfects the root canal system but does not prevent infection if the tooth is lost and the site is exposed.
- Infection can develop in the extraction socket or surrounding bone.
- The patient should have the site evaluated and possibly receive antibiotics, local care, or further dental treatment.

Recommend prompt dental follow-up for assessment and management.","Hello! Yes, it is still possible to get an infection even after a root canal if the tooth is left without a permanent filling and eventually falls out. The root canal removes the infected pulp, but the tooth structure needs to be properly sealed to prevent bacteria from entering the root area again. Without the permanent filling or crown, bacteria can enter the space, potentially leading to infection in the surrounding bone or gums.

Since your tooth has fallen out, it's important to see your dentist as soon as possible. They can evaluate the area for any signs of infection and discuss options for replacement and preventing further complications.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"hello sir, I am 27 years old mail married, when i married that time my age is 18 years old, now i am 27, i do sex everyday, now my mustache & chin hairs are growing totally red & grey.I have done daily sex thats why this is the reason to growing red & grey hair? and having left knee pain , back pain & left shoulder and some sound is coming from left knee & elbow. please advise me how to black my chin & mustache hair...","Hello! 

1. **Grey and red hair growth:**  
- Grey hair is primarily caused by genetics and aging, not by sexual activity. At 27, early greying can be due to hereditary factors, stress, nutritional deficiencies, or other health issues. Red hair in facial hair can be natural variation in hair color and is not related to sexual activity.

2. **Knee, back, and shoulder pain with joint sounds:**  
- These symptoms could be due to overuse, poor posture, injury, or early joint/muscle issues. The sounds (crepitus) in joints can be from gas bubbles or cartilage wear. It’s important to get a physical exam and possibly imaging to rule out conditions like arthritis or tendon problems.

3. **Advice:**  
- For grey hair: No proven way to reverse grey hair naturally. Hair dyes are the common option to darken hair. Ensure good nutrition (vitamins B12, D, iron, zinc) and reduce stress.  
- For joint pain: Rest, avoid strain, apply ice or heat, and consider seeing a doctor or physiotherapist for evaluation and treatment.  
- Maintain a healthy lifestyle with balanced diet, exercise, and adequate sleep.

If symptoms persist or worsen, please consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation.","Key points from the case:
- 27-year-old male
- Gradual development of red and grey hair in mustache and chin areas
- Daily sexual activity since age 18 (patient wonders if this causes hair color change)
- Left knee pain with sounds (likely crepitus)
- Back and left shoulder pain

**Analysis:**

1. **Hair color change (red and grey hair in facial areas):**  
   - Premature graying or pigment changes can be due to genetics, vitiligo, or autoimmune conditions.
   - Red hair patches could suggest poliosis or segmental vitiligo.
   - Sexual activity does not cause hair color changes.

2. **Joint pain (knee, back, shoulder) with sounds:**  
   - Pain and crepitus in a young adult could suggest early degenerative joint disease, inflammatory arthritis, or a systemic connective tissue disorder.
   - Multiple joint involvement (knee, back, shoulder) suggests a systemic process.

3. **Connecting hair changes and joint symptoms:**  
   - A syndrome that links pigmentary changes and joint problems is **Alkaptonuria** (ochronosis), which causes dark pigmentation of connective tissues and early-onset arthritis.
   - However, alkaptonuria typically causes dark blue-black pigmentation, not red or grey hair.
   - Another possibility is **vitiligo** with associated autoimmune arthritis, but vitiligo causes depigmented (white) patches, not red or grey hair.
   - **Poliosis** (localized white hair patches) can be associated with autoimmune diseases like vitiligo or alopecia areata.
   - **Hemochromatosis** can cause premature greying and arthropathy but is rare at this age and usually involves the second and third MCP joints.

4. **Most likely diagnosis:**
   - The combination of premature hair pigment changes and multiple joint pains in a young adult suggests **vitiligo-associated autoimmune arthritis** or a connective tissue disorder.
   - The red and grey hair patches are likely unrelated to sexual activity.
   - The joint symptoms could be due to early inflammatory arthritis (e.g., seronegative spondyloarthropathy) or osteoarthritis.

**Summary:**

- Hair color changes are not caused by sexual activity.
- The joint symptoms and hair changes together suggest an autoimmune or connective tissue disorder.
- The most likely diagnosis is **vitiligo with associated autoimmune arthritis** or a seronegative spondyloarthropathy with coincidental hair pigment changes.

**Recommendation:**  
Further evaluation with autoimmune markers (ANA, RF, HLA-B27), dermatology consult for hair changes, and imaging of affected joints is advised.

The chest pain, especially if severe and lasting several minutes, could indicate a heart-related issue that requires urgent attention.

**What you should do:**
- Seek emergency medical care immediately (call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room) to rule out serious cardiac problems.
- Do not ignore the chest pain, even if it has subsided.
- Inform the healthcare providers about all your symptoms, including the pins and needles and episodes of feeling hot.

Early assessment and treatment are important to ensure your safety.","The symptoms described—persistent pins and needles in the right hand, intermittent episodes of feeling very hot, and a recent episode of severe chest pain lasting about five minutes—suggest a possible neurological and cardiovascular issue.

Key points to consider:
- Persistent pins and needles in one hand could indicate peripheral nerve involvement (e.g., cervical radiculopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome) or central nervous system pathology.
- Intermittent episodes of feeling very hot may represent autonomic symptoms or systemic issues.
- Severe chest pain lasting about five minutes that has resolved raises concern for cardiac ischemia (angina), but could also be non-cardiac.

Given minimal computer use, carpal tunnel syndrome is less likely but not excluded.

**Most likely diagnosis:**
- The combination of neurological symptoms (pins and needles) and chest pain suggests a possible **cervical spine pathology causing radiculopathy** plus a **cardiac ischemic event (angina)**.
- Alternatively, if the chest pain and neurological symptoms are linked, consider **transient ischemic attack (TIA)** or **multiple sclerosis**.

**Recommended next steps:**
- Urgent cardiovascular evaluation (ECG, cardiac enzymes) to rule out acute coronary syndrome.
- Neurological examination and possibly imaging (MRI cervical spine, brain) to assess nerve involvement.
- Consider referral to cardiology and neurology.

If forced to choose one most likely diagnosis based on the chest pain and neurological symptoms, **unstable angina with possible cervical radiculopathy** is most probable.","Hi, Thanks for your query.

"Hi, I am a 19 year old female and I have had a swollen lower back for the last six months. The swelling is directly superior to my sacrum and coccyx and proximal to the lower lumbar vertebrae . I have not gone to get it checked out, because I am trying to save money and it is not painful unless I over-excersize or do something to bother it. If i do that then I get a strange numbness in my quadriceps and extreme back pain to the point where i can hardly stand or even move at all. Any ideas to what it is? I am very confused and have studied up a lot, because i was a medical student for a while.","Given your description of a persistent swollen area just above the sacrum and coccyx, with symptoms of numbness in the quadriceps and severe back pain triggered by activity, several possibilities should be considered:

1. **Pilonidal cyst or abscess**: A common cause of swelling near the sacrococcygeal area. It can become painful or infected, causing swelling and discomfort.

2. **Sacral or coccygeal cyst (e.g., Tarlov cyst)**: These can cause localized swelling and nerve symptoms if they compress nearby nerves.

3. **Spinal or paraspinal mass or cyst**: Could cause swelling and nerve root irritation leading to quadriceps numbness and severe pain.

4. **Lumbar disc herniation or nerve root compression**: Although swelling is less typical, nerve compression at lower lumbar levels (L2-L4) can cause quadriceps numbness and severe pain.

5. **Other soft tissue masses or infections**: Lipomas, abscesses, or other masses could cause swelling and secondary nerve irritation.

Because your symptoms include neurological signs (numbness in the quadriceps) and severe pain limiting mobility, it is important to get a thorough clinical evaluation. Imaging studies such as MRI of the lumbosacral spine and pelvis would be very helpful to identify the cause of swelling and nerve involvement.

**Recommendation:** Please seek medical evaluation promptly, even if the swelling is not painful at rest. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent worsening symptoms and complications. If cost is a concern, consider community health clinics or teaching hospitals where evaluations may be more affordable.

If you develop worsening pain, weakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or inability to move, seek emergency care immediately.","The most likely diagnosis is a **pilonidal cyst (or pilonidal disease)**.

**Rationale:**
- Location: The swelling is directly superior to the sacrum and coccyx, a classic site for pilonidal cysts.
- Duration: Chronic swelling over six months fits the typical course.
- Symptoms: Usually painless but can become painful with pressure or movement, consistent with inflammation or infection of a pilonidal cyst.
- Associated symptoms: Pain radiating and causing numbness in the quadriceps suggests possible irritation or inflammation affecting nearby nerves, possibly due to local inflammation or secondary infection.
- Age and gender: Pilonidal disease commonly affects young adults, especially males, but females can also be affected.

**Next steps:**
- Clinical examination to confirm the presence of a midline sinus or cyst.
- Imaging (ultrasound or MRI) if needed to assess extent.

I have this lump inside my neck on the lower right side and its been there for about a year. A few years ago I had something similer but on the other side and it went away. It causes me no pain but it feels like its getting bigger. I had it looked at during my last physical and was told it was just a cyst.  I also have a bump on the back of  my head close to my hairline at the bottom. Its about the size of a penny and very hard. Ever since I discovered it a few weeks ago it has only gotten bigger and now it is very sensitive.I am a very healthy and fit teenage girl who is 5 7. Please any information would be helpful!,"Thank you for sharing your symptoms. Here’s a summary and some important considerations:

1. **Neck Lump (Lower Right Side, present for about a year, possibly a cyst):**
   - A cyst is a common benign (non-cancerous) lump that can remain stable or slowly grow.
   - Since it has been there for a year and was previously evaluated as a cyst, it is likely benign.
   - However, the fact that it feels like it is getting bigger means it should be monitored closely.
   - If it changes rapidly, becomes painful, or shows signs of infection (redness, warmth), you should see a doctor promptly.

2. **Bump on the Back of the Head (near hairline, hard, size of a penny, growing, sensitive):**
   - A hard, growing, and sensitive lump on the scalp could be a variety of things including a cyst, lipoma, or less commonly other growths.
   - Sensitivity and growth over a few weeks warrant evaluation by a healthcare professional.
   - It is important to have this lump examined, and possibly imaged (ultrasound or other) or biopsied if needed.

**Recommendations:**
- Schedule an appointment with your primary care provider or a dermatologist for a thorough physical exam.
- They may order imaging studies (like ultrasound) to better characterize both lumps.
- If either lump changes rapidly, becomes very painful, or you develop other symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), seek medical attention promptly.
- Keep a record of any changes in size, pain, or other symptoms.

While most lumps in young healthy individuals are benign, it is important to have persistent or growing lumps evaluated to rule out other causes.

If you want, I can help you prepare questions for your doctor or provide information on what to expect during the evaluation.","The presentation includes:

- A painless, slowly enlarging lump on the lower right side of the neck present for about a year.
- A similar lump on the opposite side years ago that resolved spontaneously.
- The lump was previously diagnosed as a cyst.
- A new hard, sensitive, penny-sized bump near the hairline on the back of the head that has grown over a few weeks.

**Most likely diagnosis: Branchial cleft cyst with secondary infection or inflammation**

**Rationale:**

- The painless, slowly enlarging lateral neck mass in a teenager is classic for a branchial cleft cyst, a congenital epithelial cyst arising from incomplete obliteration of the branchial clefts.
- The history of a similar lump on the opposite side that resolved spontaneously supports a congenital cystic lesion prone to intermittent swelling or infection.
- The new hard, sensitive bump near the hairline could represent an infected cyst or an inflamed epidermoid cyst (common on the scalp), possibly related or a separate lesion.
- The increase in size and tenderness of the scalp lesion suggests secondary infection or inflammation.

**Other considerations:**

- Lymphadenopathy is less likely given the long duration and lack of systemic symptoms.
- Thyroglossal duct cysts are midline, not lateral.
- Malignancy is unlikely in a healthy teenager with a long-standing painless mass.

**Summary:**

The most likely diagnosis is a branchial cleft cyst on the neck with a new infected cystic lesion on the scalp.

- If either lump changes rapidly, becomes very painful, or you develop other symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), seek medical attention promptly.
- Keep a record of any changes in size, pain, or other symptoms.

While most lumps in young healthy individuals are benign, it is important to have persistent or growing lumps evaluated to rule out other causes.

If you want, I can help you prepare questions for your doctor or provide information on what to expect during the evaluation.","Hi, Good afternoon from India.

"I had 4 wisdom teeth taken out 5 years ago, 3 were impacted. The following day of surgery It was infected horribly. my entire face was swollen to the point i couldt open my lips . EVER since, But not prior to, I have had constant pain and sorenes on both sides of my neck just behind jaw bone close to ear, and under my chin on both sides. After the surgery once infected the dentist gave me antibiotics, following a year later my doctor said maybe there was some infection lingering or something with my nodes. could the infection have damaged my muscle or lymphnoids?","It's possible that the severe infection following your wisdom teeth extraction caused inflammation or damage to nearby structures such as lymph nodes, muscles, or soft tissues in the neck and jaw area. The lymph nodes in that region can become chronically enlarged or tender if there was lingering infection or inflammation. Muscle soreness could also result from prolonged inflammation, scar tissue formation, or altered jaw mechanics after surgery and infection.

However, persistent pain and soreness for years after the infection warrants thorough evaluation to rule out:

- Chronic infection or abscess
- Lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes) due to other causes
- Nerve involvement or damage
- Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders
- Myofascial pain syndrome or muscle strain

I recommend seeing an oral surgeon or an ENT specialist for a detailed clinical exam, imaging (like ultrasound or MRI), and possibly blood tests to assess for ongoing inflammation or infection. They can determine if the lymph nodes or muscles are affected and guide appropriate treatment.

In summary, yes, the infection could have caused damage or chronic inflammation, but further evaluation is needed to identify the exact cause of your persistent symptoms.","The patient's history of severe postoperative infection with significant facial swelling and persistent bilateral neck pain and soreness near the jaw and under the chin suggests a chronic inflammatory or infectious process involving the deep neck spaces or lymph nodes.

Most likely diagnosis: **Chronic lymphadenitis or fibrosis of the lymph nodes and surrounding soft tissues secondary to a severe postoperative infection (possibly a deep neck space infection such as Ludwig's angina or cellulitis) following impacted wisdom tooth extraction.**

Explanation:
- Impacted wisdom tooth extraction can lead to deep space infections (e.g., submandibular, submental spaces).
- Severe infection with facial swelling and trismus (inability to open lips/mouth) indicates involvement of masticatory muscles and deep neck spaces.
- Persistent bilateral neck pain and soreness near the jaw and under the chin suggest chronic inflammation or fibrosis of lymph nodes and muscles.
- Lingering infection or lymph node involvement was suspected by the physician, consistent with chronic lymphadenitis or scarring.
- Damage to muscles (e.g., myositis or fibrosis) and lymph nodes is possible after severe infection.

Further evaluation with imaging (e.g., ultrasound or MRI of neck) and possibly biopsy may be needed to rule out abscess, chronic infection, or other pathology.

In summary, the most likely diagnosis is **chronic lymphadenitis and fibrosis of deep neck tissues secondary to severe postoperative infection after impacted wisdom tooth extraction.**","Hi as there is pain and soreness on both sides of your neck behind jaw bone and under the chin area, it points toward excessive trauma while your extraction which could have lead to excessive damage to bone and surrounding muscles and nerves.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder for last 6months. I am overweight and started exercising since 6months and lost 20 kgs in 6months.i am experiencing rib popping and discomfort in the left side of my chest for last 5 months.i have done my tests related to heart and all seems normal.apart from rib popping/snapping I get left side chest pains and occasionally jaw pain.i have irritation on my right shoulder blade which burns on touching and gives sharp pains at times which last for a minute .i have food in small quantities and eat on time specially at night.i even take antacid tablets at times after meals fearing of acid reflux.my life is not the same I have done CBT sessions as well but that didnt help me much except the breathing exercises which i still do.i am fed up of this. The mentioned pains occur when there is no anxiety at all its when I am doing normal things and suddenly it hits. Now i constantly fear of having a heart attack anytime.Dr please help me to get back the real me.i request you to keep this confidential and not make my query public.thanks.,"Thank you for sharing your detailed symptoms and concerns. Given your history and the tests you've done showing normal heart function, it is reassuring that serious cardiac issues are less likely. However, your symptoms of rib popping, left-sided chest discomfort, jaw pain, and right shoulder blade burning pain could be related to musculoskeletal causes such as costochondritis (inflammation of rib cartilage), muscle strain, or nerve irritation. These conditions can cause sharp, intermittent pains and discomfort that mimic heart-related pain.

Your anxiety disorder can also amplify the perception of pain and contribute to muscle tension, which may worsen these symptoms. The fact that pain occurs even when you are not anxious suggests a physical component, but anxiety can still play a role in symptom severity.

Recommendations:
1. **Follow-up with a musculoskeletal specialist or pain specialist**: They can assess for costochondritis, nerve impingement, or muscle issues and may suggest physical therapy or targeted treatments.
2. **Continue breathing exercises and consider relaxation techniques**: These help manage anxiety and muscle tension.
3. **Maintain a healthy lifestyle**: Your weight loss and exercise are excellent steps.
4. **Avoid excessive antacid use without clear diagnosis**: If acid reflux is suspected, a gastroenterologist can evaluate and treat appropriately.
5. **Keep regular follow-up with your healthcare provider**: To monitor symptoms and rule out any new developments.

If you experience worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms, seek emergency care immediately.

Your concerns are valid, and it’s important to address both physical and psychological aspects. You are not alone, and with the right multidisciplinary approach, you can regain your quality of life. Please keep this information confidential as requested. If you want, I can help guide you on how to discuss these symptoms further with your doctor.","The patient's presentation includes:

- Anxiety disorder history
- Significant weight loss through exercise
- Left-sided rib popping and discomfort for 5 months
- Left-sided chest pain and occasional left jaw pain
- Burning and sharp pain near the right shoulder blade lasting about a minute
- Symptoms occur during normal activities, not linked to anxiety episodes
- Normal cardiac evaluations
- Use of antacids for presumed acid reflux
- Limited benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy except breathing exercises

**Key points:**
- Chest pain with normal cardiac workup
- Rib popping and localized chest wall discomfort
- Burning and sharp pain near the shoulder blade
- Symptoms unrelated to anxiety episodes
- Partial response to antacids

**Most likely diagnosis:**

**Costochondritis or musculoskeletal chest wall pain (including slipping rib syndrome or intercostal nerve irritation).**

Rationale:
- Rib popping and localized chest wall discomfort suggest a musculoskeletal cause.
- Burning and sharp pain near the shoulder blade can be referred pain from the chest wall or intercostal nerves.
- Normal cardiac workup excludes ischemic heart disease.
- Acid reflux symptoms are intermittent and not fully explanatory.
- Anxiety is present but symptoms occur independently of anxiety episodes.
- Weight loss is likely intentional and related to exercise, not malignancy.

**Additional considerations:**
- Slipping rib syndrome (due to rib subluxation causing popping and pain)
- Intercostal neuralgia
- Costochondritis (inflammation of costal cartilage)

**Recommendation:**
- Physical examination focusing on chest wall tenderness, reproduction of pain with palpation or movement

I am a 27 year old woman that has recently in the past week developed a rash on my chest. They look like little pimples with small whiteheads. I pop the whiteheads off and the bumps swell and about 20 to 30 mins later they have whiteheads again. Please help me figure out what this is.,"Based on your description of a rash on your chest with small pimples and recurring whiteheads, this sounds like it could be **acne** or possibly **folliculitis** (inflammation of hair follicles). Popping whiteheads can worsen inflammation and lead to more whiteheads forming.

Key points:
- Acne commonly appears as pimples with whiteheads.
- Folliculitis can look similar and is often caused by irritation or infection of hair follicles.
- Repeatedly popping whiteheads can cause swelling, irritation, and potential infection.

Recommendations:
- Avoid popping or squeezing the bumps to prevent worsening.
- Keep the area clean and use a gentle cleanser.
- Over-the-counter topical treatments with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid may help.
- If the rash worsens, spreads, or is painful, see a healthcare provider for evaluation and possible prescription treatment.

If you have other symptoms like fever, severe pain, or spreading redness, seek medical attention promptly.","The most likely diagnosis is **acne vulgaris**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Age: Acne commonly affects young adults.
- Rash location: Chest is a common site for acne.
- Lesion type: Small pimples with whiteheads (closed comedones).
- Behavior: Popping whiteheads leads to swelling and rapid reformation, typical of acne lesions due to follicular blockage and inflammation.

Other conditions like folliculitis or milia are less likely given the description and rapid reformation of whiteheads.

**Summary:** Acne vulgaris is the most probable diagnosis.","Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor I will keep a possibility of Inflammatory acne. Apart from face, acne can also involve the chest, back and shoulder area because these areas are rich in sebaceous glands. If I was the treating doctor I would have certainly started you on Oral antibiotics e.g. either Doxycycline or Azithromycin. Oral antibiotics are indicated if the acne is inflammatory. Topically I usually ask my patients to apply benzoyl peroxide gel, twice daily. It is antibacterial as well as anti-inflammatory. These are prescription medicines, and therefore I suggest you to visit a dermatologist in your region for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate prescription.

I have a lump about the size of a quarter on the oside of my leg above the knee. Its hard and very painful. Its red and looks a little bruised. And some days its surrounded by a larger pink area and some days its not. I woke up today with a low grade fever. I have tried hot compresses to see if it would form a head thinking it might be a boil. Do you have any advice?,"Your symptoms—a hard, painful, red lump above the knee with some bruising, fluctuating surrounding pink area, and a low-grade fever—suggest an infection, possibly an abscess or infected cyst. The fever indicates your body is fighting an infection.

**Advice:**
- Avoid squeezing or trying to lance the lump yourself.
- Continue warm compresses to help drainage if it forms a head.
- Monitor for worsening symptoms: increasing pain, spreading redness, high fever, or pus drainage.
- Seek medical evaluation promptly. You may need antibiotics or a professional drainage procedure.
- If you develop high fever, chills, or the redness rapidly spreads, seek emergency care.

Since the symptoms have recurred, it is important to seek medical evaluation promptly to:

- Confirm the diagnosis (e.g., asthma, allergic reaction, or other causes)
- Assess your lung function (spirometry or peak flow)
- Adjust or start appropriate treatment

"My mother has Hgb 10.3....not sure of her labs, indicating kidney function, but primary has sent her to oncologist, who has scheduled her for iron transfusion.  He said he will repeat Hgb in four weeks, following transfusion, then will determine if bone marrow biopsy needed......is this to diagnose multiple myeloma?","A hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 10.3 indicates mild to moderate anemia. Anemia can have many causes, including iron deficiency, chronic kidney disease, or bone marrow disorders.

The oncologist's plan to give an iron transfusion (likely intravenous iron) and then recheck hemoglobin in four weeks is a common approach to treat and evaluate anemia. If the anemia does not improve after iron treatment, further investigation such as a bone marrow biopsy may be needed to look for underlying causes, including bone marrow disorders or cancers like multiple myeloma.

Multiple myeloma is one possible cause of anemia and bone marrow dysfunction, but the oncologist will consider other causes as well. The bone marrow biopsy is a diagnostic step to evaluate for multiple myeloma or other marrow diseases if initial treatments do not resolve the anemia.

In summary, the oncologist’s approach is consistent with evaluating anemia causes, including but not limited to multiple myeloma. Further tests will clarify the diagnosis. If you have concerns, discuss them directly with the oncologist for more specific information about your mother’s case.","The most likely diagnosis in this elderly female patient with anemia (Hb 10.3 g/dL) and impaired kidney function is **anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD)** or possibly **iron deficiency anemia** related to CKD. The oncologist's plan for iron transfusion (likely intravenous iron) and follow-up hemoglobin measurement aligns with treating anemia due to iron deficiency or CKD.

A bone marrow biopsy is generally considered if anemia does not improve after iron therapy or if there is suspicion of a hematologic malignancy such as multiple myeloma or myelodysplastic syndrome. While multiple myeloma can cause anemia and kidney impairment, the initial approach is to correct reversible causes like iron deficiency.

**Summary:**
- Most likely diagnosis: Anemia related to chronic kidney disease (possibly iron deficiency anemia).
- The evaluation is initially to treat anemia and assess response.
- Bone marrow biopsy is a secondary step if anemia persists or if malignancy is suspected.
- The current workup is not specifically targeted at diagnosing multiple myeloma but may include it if indicated later.

If multiple myeloma is suspected clinically (e.g., bone pain, hypercalcemia, monoclonal protein), additional tests like serum protein electrophoresis and urine studies would be done.","Hi, dairy have gone through your question.

I have hpv the cancerous kind. Have had it since I got with my husband 5 yrs ago.  Just had a LEEP procedure done. But now my husband is having issues and got diagnosed with prostasis and given Cipro. It doesnt seem to be helping. Could his issues be because of hpv? Should he let his doctor know about hpv on the follow up?,"HPV (human papillomavirus), including the cancerous types, primarily affects epithelial cells and is linked to cervical, anal, and some other cancers. It is not known to cause prostatitis (inflammation or infection of the prostate). Prostatitis is usually caused by bacterial infections or other non-viral factors.

Your husband's prostatitis is unlikely to be caused by HPV. However, it is important for him to inform his doctor about your HPV diagnosis and any sexual health history, as this helps the doctor consider all possible factors and ensure appropriate evaluation and treatment.

If Cipro (ciprofloxacin) is not improving his symptoms, he should follow up with his doctor for further assessment, as he may need additional tests or a different treatment approach.

In summary:
- HPV is unlikely to cause prostatitis.
- Your husband should inform his doctor about your HPV status.
- He should follow up with his doctor if symptoms persist despite antibiotics.

If you have further concerns, consulting a urologist or infectious disease specialist may be helpful.","The patient's husband has prostatitis with persistent symptoms despite ciprofloxacin treatment. Prostatitis is commonly caused by bacterial infections, but chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) can be nonbacterial and unrelated to typical bacterial pathogens.

Regarding HPV:

- High-risk HPV primarily affects epithelial tissues of the anogenital tract and is linked to cervical, penile, and other cancers.
- HPV is not known to cause prostatitis or prostate infections.
- There is no established link between HPV infection and prostatitis symptoms.

Most likely diagnosis for the husband:

- Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), which is often nonbacterial and may not respond to antibiotics like ciprofloxacin.

Summary:

- The husband's prostatitis symptoms are unlikely related to HPV.
- Persistent symptoms despite antibiotics suggest nonbacterial prostatitis or another cause.
- Further urological evaluation is recommended.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Discuss Your Concerns with Your Dentist/Oral Surgeon:** Before any procedure, clearly communicate your worries about nerve injury and numbness. They can explain the risks, benefits, and precautions they will take.

2. **Imaging and Assessment:** Your dentist will likely take updated X-rays or a CBCT scan to assess the exact position of the wisdom tooth relative to the facial nerve. This helps plan a safer extraction.

3. **Surgical Expertise:** Choose an experienced oral surgeon who is skilled in managing teeth close to nerves. They use careful techniques to minimize nerve injury.

4. **Possible Alternatives:** If the risk is very high, your dentist might suggest monitoring the tooth or other treatments instead of immediate extraction.

5. **Post-Op Numbness:** Temporary numbness can occur but permanent numbness is rare. Your surgeon will inform you about this risk.

6. **Pain Management:** Continue using hot packs as advised and take any prescribed pain medication.

Your best step now is to share your concerns openly at your upcoming appointment.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Impacted lower wisdom tooth beneath the gum.
- Close proximity to a facial nerve (likely the inferior alveolar nerve or lingual nerve).
- Recurrent pain managed initially with hot packs.
- Concern about numbness suggests possible nerve irritation or involvement.

This condition can cause intermittent pain and inflammation. Nerve involvement can lead to numbness or altered sensation in the lower lip, chin, or tongue. The dentist will evaluate the tooth's position, nerve proximity (often with imaging like a panoramic X-ray or CBCT), and decide on management, which may include extraction or conservative treatment.

Hi I have constant dull ache in my lower back. I can`t stand for long and find sitting on a hard seat for long very uncomfortable. Even walking is hard as I feel very stiff. I was in a car accident last year and did major damage to my lower leg. This meant I had to sit for months with my leg up as it was non weight bearing. I am wondering if this is a muscular  problem or perhaps arthritis,"Your symptoms of constant dull ache in the lower back, stiffness, and discomfort with prolonged standing or sitting could be due to several causes, including muscular strain, arthritis, or changes related to prolonged immobility after your leg injury.

Given your history of prolonged sitting with your leg elevated and limited mobility after the car accident, muscle weakness, deconditioning, or joint stiffness could contribute to your symptoms. Arthritis (such as osteoarthritis or facet joint arthritis) is also possible, especially if there is joint degeneration or inflammation.

To differentiate:
- Muscular problems often improve with movement and worsen with inactivity.
- Arthritis pain may worsen with activity and improve with rest, often accompanied by stiffness, especially in the morning.

I recommend seeing a healthcare provider for a thorough physical exam and possibly imaging (like X-rays or MRI) to evaluate your spine and joints. Physical therapy may help improve muscle strength and flexibility. If arthritis is diagnosed, treatment options include medications, lifestyle changes, and possibly injections.

If you develop neurological symptoms (numbness, weakness, bowel/bladder changes), seek urgent medical attention.","The patient's symptoms—constant dull lower back ache, difficulty standing for long periods, discomfort when sitting on hard surfaces, stiffness affecting walking—combined with a history of prolonged non-weight-bearing and leg elevation after a significant lower leg injury, suggest a mechanical or structural issue rather than a primary muscular problem.

Prolonged non-weight-bearing can lead to muscle atrophy and joint stiffness, but the pattern of symptoms and stiffness, especially involving the lower back and difficulty with weight-bearing activities, is more consistent with **early degenerative changes or arthritis of the lumbar spine or sacroiliac joints**. The altered biomechanics and compensatory postures after the leg injury may have accelerated degenerative changes.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Post-traumatic lumbar spine or sacroiliac joint osteoarthritis** (degenerative arthritis secondary to altered biomechanics and prolonged immobilization).

Muscular pain alone typically presents with more variable, activity-related discomfort and less stiffness. Arthritis causes constant dull ache, stiffness, and worsens with prolonged positions.

Further evaluation with physical exam, imaging (X-rays or MRI of lumbar spine and pelvis), and possibly inflammatory markers can help confirm the diagnosis.","Hello, Welcome at Chat Doctor.

A painful, nickel-sized, oval bump between your left testicle and thigh, especially with worsening pain and swelling in the leg on that side, could indicate an **inguinal hernia** or an **infected lymph node**. 

- **Inguinal hernia**: This occurs when tissue, such as part of the intestine, pushes through a weak spot in the groin muscles. It often causes a painful bulge that worsens with standing or straining.
- **Infected or swollen lymph node**: Lymph nodes in the groin can become enlarged and painful due to infection or inflammation, sometimes causing leg swelling if lymphatic drainage is affected.
- Less commonly, it could be an abscess or other soft tissue infection.

Given the pain, increasing size, and leg swelling, this could be a serious condition requiring prompt medical evaluation.

- Location: Between the testicle and thigh corresponds to the inguinal region.
- Pain worsens on standing: Increased intra-abdominal pressure can exacerbate hernia symptoms.

Yes I am a 32yr old male.  I am having difficulty urinating and have been having difficulty for some time now.  When I do go and think I am done I continue to have a small amount come out.  I am also unable to get an erection.  For the past couple of weeks I have been experiencing pain in my lower back and hips that seems worse at night.  My father had prostate problems and I am concerned.....  However I know it would be very rare at my age......  Is it possible?  I see my doctor next week Monday,"Your symptoms of difficulty urinating, incomplete emptying, erectile dysfunction, and lower back and hip pain are concerning and warrant prompt evaluation. While prostate problems like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer are less common at your age (32), they are not impossible. Other causes such as urinary tract infections, prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), neurological issues, or other urological conditions could also explain your symptoms.

Given your family history and symptoms, it is important to see your doctor as planned. They will likely perform a physical exam, including a digital rectal exam, and may order urine tests, blood tests (including PSA), and imaging studies to determine the cause.

If your symptoms worsen (e.g., inability to urinate, severe pain, fever), seek urgent medical care. Otherwise, keep a symptom diary to share with your doctor.

In summary:
- Prostate problems are possible but less common at your age.
- Other causes like prostatitis or neurological issues may be involved.

- Most likely diagnosis: **Ankylosing spondylitis**
- Reasoning: Young male, inflammatory back pain, erectile dysfunction, urinary symptoms possibly from neurogenic bladder
- Next steps: Physical exam, HLA-B27 testing, pelvic/spinal X-rays or MRI, urological evaluation

"I have had high bp for 14yrs but on meds for last 3yrs recently had a lot of migraines and headaches caused by hypertension also painful eyeballs and sockets, my bp is 180/100 today but now i have slightly sore lumps below the chin (2) either side , i have had a very painful left leg running from the hip to knee , a painful left arm and chest pain on same side, i have been breathless for a few years although iam not overweight.","Your symptoms are concerning and suggest multiple serious issues that need urgent medical evaluation:

- Blood pressure of 180/100 is very high and requires immediate management.
- Migraines, painful eyeballs, and headaches can be related to uncontrolled hypertension or other neurological issues.
- Painful lumps below the chin could indicate infection, swollen lymph nodes, or other pathology.
- Pain in the left leg (hip to knee), left arm, and chest pain on the same side, along with breathlessness, raise concern for cardiovascular problems such as angina, deep vein thrombosis, or even a heart attack.

**Immediate action:**
- Seek emergency medical care right away (call emergency services or go to the nearest ER).
- Do not delay, as chest pain and breathlessness with high BP can be life-threatening.

**Long-term:**
- You will need thorough cardiovascular, neurological, and possibly infectious disease evaluation.
- Strict blood pressure control and follow-up with your healthcare provider are essential.

Please get emergency help immediately.","The patient has a long history of poorly controlled hypertension (BP 180/100 mmHg), recent hypertensive headaches and migraines, painful eye sockets (possibly hypertensive retinopathy or optic involvement), and bilateral submandibular lumps. Additionally, there is severe pain in the left leg and arm, left-sided chest pain, and chronic breathlessness.

Key points to consider:

1. **Hypertension complications:**  
   - Severe hypertension can cause headaches, eye symptoms (hypertensive retinopathy, optic neuropathy), and chest pain (possible ischemic heart disease or hypertensive heart disease).  
   - Chronic breathlessness may indicate heart failure or pulmonary hypertension secondary to longstanding hypertension.

2. **Bilateral submandibular lumps:**  
   - These could be enlarged lymph nodes, salivary gland enlargement, or other masses. In the context of hypertension and systemic symptoms, they might represent lymphadenopathy or related pathology.

3. **Painful left leg and arm:**  
   - Severe pain in limbs could indicate vascular ischemia (e.g., peripheral arterial disease), neuropathy, or musculoskeletal causes.  
   - Given the hypertension and chest pain, vascular causes such as arterial occlusion or embolism should be considered.

4. **Chest pain and breathlessness:**  
   - Could be angina, heart failure, or pulmonary causes.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

- The combination of longstanding severe hypertension with systemic symptoms, painful limbs, chest pain, and bilateral submandibular lumps suggests **hypertensive crisis with end-organ damage**, possibly complicated by **atherosclerotic vascular disease** causing ischemic pain in limbs and chest.  
- The lumps may represent **lymphadenopathy** due to an underlying systemic process (e.g., infection, malignancy) or hypertensive-related salivary gland enlargement, but this is less typical.

**Alternatively, consider:**

- **Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN):**  
  - A medium-vessel vasculitis that can cause hypertension (due to renal artery involvement), painful nodules or lumps, limb pain from ischemia, chest pain, and systemic symptoms.  
  - Bilateral submandibular lumps could be tender nodules or inflamed arteries.  
  - PAN often presents with hypertension, systemic symptoms, and painful extremities.

Given the constellation of symptoms—longstanding hypertension, painful lumps, limb ischemia, chest pain, and breathlessness—the most likely diagnosis is **Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)** causing secondary hypertension and systemic ischemic symptoms.

**Recommendation:**  
Urgent referral for vascular imaging, inflammatory markers, and biopsy of lumps if possible. Immediate blood pressure control and evaluation for vasculitis are critical.

I am a diabetic Occasionally I have a burning sensation in my face neck and body It will pass in a few minutes These events occur with out warning This event occurred to me while eating lunch today My fasting bs today was 147 I checked it during this event it was 202 I was also eating lunch Does this nerve tingling and heat sensation have a meaning that I can take corrective measures to prevent?,"The burning sensation and nerve tingling you describe, especially in the context of diabetes, could be related to diabetic neuropathy or fluctuations in blood sugar levels. A blood sugar of 202 mg/dL during the event indicates hyperglycemia, which can contribute to nerve irritation and symptoms like burning or tingling.

Key points and recommendations:
1. **Possible Cause:** These sensations may be due to nerve irritation from high blood sugar or early diabetic neuropathy.
2. **Blood Sugar Control:** Maintaining blood glucose within target ranges is crucial. Your fasting level of 147 mg/dL is above the recommended target (usually <130 mg/dL fasting), indicating room for better control.
3. **Monitor Symptoms:** Keep a log of when these episodes occur, your blood sugar levels at those times, and any other symptoms.
4. **Medical Evaluation:** See your healthcare provider or endocrinologist for a thorough evaluation. They may check for neuropathy and adjust your diabetes management plan.
5. **Preventive Measures:** Improved blood sugar control, a balanced diet, regular exercise, and possibly medications to protect nerves may be advised.

If the burning sensation worsens, spreads, or is accompanied by other symptoms like weakness, vision changes, or chest pain, seek medical attention promptly.","The patient's symptoms of occasional burning sensation and tingling in the face, neck, and body, along with a history of diabetes and elevated blood sugar levels (202 mg/dL postprandial, 147 mg/dL fasting), are most consistent with **diabetic neuropathy**.

**Explanation:**
- Diabetic neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes caused by chronic hyperglycemia leading to nerve damage.
- Symptoms often include burning, tingling, numbness, or pain, typically in the extremities but can also affect other areas.
- Episodes lasting a few minutes and occurring without warning fit with neuropathic sensory disturbances.

**Corrective measures:**
- Optimize blood glucose control to prevent progression and reduce symptoms.
- Maintain HbA1c within target range (usually <7% or individualized).
- Symptomatic treatment may include medications like gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine if symptoms are severe.
- Lifestyle modifications: healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation.

"Hello sir my wife is 35 week 2 days pregnant, yesterday we have 2 shots of betnesol injection at an interval of 12 hours dose 12mg but after that we noticed that baby is not moving frequently as he is doing before??My question is is it due to betnesol injection or at 35 week less movement are observed???","At 35 weeks and 2 days of pregnancy, some variation in fetal movement can occur, but a noticeable decrease in movement should always be taken seriously.

Betnesol (betamethasone) is a corticosteroid commonly given to help mature the baby's lungs when preterm delivery is possible. It is not known to directly reduce fetal movements.

However, decreased fetal movement can be due to various reasons and should be promptly evaluated by a healthcare provider. It is important to monitor fetal movements closely and report any significant decrease immediately.

**Recommendations:**
- Contact your obstetrician or healthcare provider urgently to report the decreased fetal movements.
- They may perform a non-stress test (NST) or ultrasound to assess fetal well-being.
- Do not wait or assume the steroid injection is the cause without medical evaluation.

In summary, decreased fetal movement at 35 weeks is not typically caused by betamethasone injections and requires prompt medical assessment to ensure the baby's health.","Betnesol (betamethasone) is a corticosteroid commonly administered to pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery to accelerate fetal lung maturity. It is not known to directly cause decreased fetal movements.

At 35 weeks and 2 days gestation, fetal movement patterns can vary, but a noticeable decrease in fetal movements is not typical and should always be evaluated carefully.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
The decreased fetal movements are unlikely to be a direct effect of Betnesol injections. Instead, they may indicate fetal distress or other complications requiring prompt assessment.

**Recommended action:**  
- Immediate clinical evaluation including non-stress test (NST) or cardiotocography (CTG) to assess fetal well-being.  
- Ultrasound assessment for fetal growth, amniotic fluid volume, and Doppler studies if indicated.  
- Close monitoring and possible intervention depending on findings.

**Summary:**  
Decreased fetal movements at 35 weeks are not typical and are unlikely caused by Betnesol.

While some lumps can be benign (such as cysts or lipomas), a hard lump, especially with your medical history, warrants careful assessment to rule out recurrence of lymphoma, metastasis, or other serious conditions.

Please schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or oncologist as soon as possible for a thorough physical examination and likely imaging or biopsy to determine the nature of the lump. If you experience any rapid growth, pain, redness, or other systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), seek urgent medical attention.","In an elderly patient with a history of lymphoma presenting with a hard, semicircular lump on the lower back, the most likely diagnosis is a **cutaneous lymphoma deposit or a lymphoma-related skin lesion** (cutaneous involvement of lymphoma).

Key points supporting this:
- History of lymphoma increases the risk of skin involvement by lymphoma cells.
- Hard, fixed lumps can represent tumor deposits.
- Location on the back is a common site for cutaneous lymphoma lesions.

Is amoeba hyst. Dangerous to the fetus? I am 34+3 weeks pregnant. I recently had some loose poops 3 times during the day but I thought it was due to lots of yogurt. Today I had mucous and blood in my stool. I am going to my OB next week but I am already worried. Should I treat it now or wait after delivery? Should I delivered naturally or by cesarian?Is it very dangerous to the fetus? Please answer in details last 3 auesrions. Thank you.,"Amoeba hyst. (Entamoeba histolytica) infection during pregnancy can be concerning, especially with symptoms like mucus and blood in stool, which suggest invasive amoebic colitis.

1. **Is it dangerous to the fetus?**  
   Amoebiasis itself does not directly infect the fetus, but severe maternal illness (dehydration, malnutrition, systemic infection) can affect fetal well-being, potentially leading to preterm labor or growth issues. Prompt treatment reduces risks.

2. **Should you treat it now or wait until after delivery?**  
   Treatment during pregnancy is important to prevent complications. Safe medications like paromomycin (a luminal agent) can be used in pregnancy to clear intestinal infection. Metronidazole, often used for invasive disease, is generally considered safe in the second and third trimesters but should be used under medical supervision. Delaying treatment risks worsening infection and complications.

3. **Should you deliver naturally or by cesarean?**  
   Amoebiasis itself is not an indication for cesarean delivery. The mode of delivery depends on obstetric factors. If the infection is well-controlled and there are no obstetric contraindications, vaginal delivery is generally safe. However, if there is severe systemic illness or complications, your OB may consider cesarean delivery.

**Recommendations:**  
- See your OB promptly or go to emergency care if symptoms worsen (fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent bleeding).  
- Inform your doctor about your symptoms and possible amoebiasis.  
- Follow your doctor’s advice on safe treatment during pregnancy.  
- Maintain hydration and nutrition.  
- Monitor fetal movements and report any decrease.

Early diagnosis and treatment are key to protecting both you and your baby. Do not delay medical care.","The presence of recent onset loose stools with mucus and blood in a pregnant patient suggests an invasive colitis rather than simple dietary intolerance. Given the clinical picture and the concern about amoebic infection, the most likely diagnosis is **Amoebic colitis (Entamoeba histolytica infection)**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Bloody, mucous-containing diarrhea is characteristic of invasive amoebic colitis.
- Amoebiasis is common in endemic areas and can present during pregnancy.
- The initial attribution to yogurt is less likely to cause bloody diarrhea.

Regarding risks and management:
- Amoebic infection can pose risks to the mother (severe colitis, perforation) and potentially to the fetus (preterm labor, low birth weight).
- Treatment with safe anti-amoebic drugs (e.g., metronidazole) is recommended during pregnancy, preferably after the first trimester.
- Delivery mode is generally not altered solely due to amoebic colitis unless there are obstetric indications.

**Summary:**
- Most likely diagnosis: **Amoebic colitis (Entamoeba histolytica infection)**
- Confirm diagnosis with stool microscopy, antigen testing, or PCR.
- Start appropriate anti-amoebic treatment promptly.
- Monitor pregnancy closely; mode of delivery depends on obstetric factors, not amoebiasis alone.","Hello, Thanks for trusting us with your health concern.

   Treatment during pregnancy is important to prevent complications. Safe medications like paromomycin (a luminal agent) can be used in pregnancy to clear intestinal infection. Metronidazole, often used for invasive disease, is generally considered safe in the second and third trimesters but should be used under medical supervision. Delaying treatment risks worsening infection and complications.

3. **Should you deliver naturally or by cesarean?**  
   Amoebiasis itself is not an indication for cesarean delivery. The mode of delivery depends on obstetric factors. If the infection is well-controlled and there are no obstetric contraindications, vaginal delivery is generally safe. However, if there is severe systemic illness or complications, your OB may consider cesarean delivery.

**Recommendations:**  
- See your OB promptly or go to emergency care if symptoms worsen (fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent bleeding).  
- Inform your doctor about your symptoms and possible amoebiasis.  
- Follow your doctor’s advice on safe treatment during pregnancy.  
- Maintain hydration and nutrition.  
- Monitor fetal movements and report any decrease.

Early diagnosis and treatment are key to protecting both you and your baby. Do not delay medical care.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
I have COPD and emphasema. Lately I ve had very fatigued legs from morning and all day long making it difficult to exercise or to walk to lose extra weight that I have gained in the last few years. Does this fatigue have to do with my condition? or is it something else? I have yearly blood work and checkups with my dr.,"Fatigue in the legs can be related to COPD and emphysema, but it may also have other causes. In COPD and emphysema, reduced oxygen levels and poor circulation can lead to muscle fatigue and weakness. Additionally, inactivity due to breathing difficulties can cause muscle deconditioning, contributing to leg fatigue.

However, other factors could also cause leg fatigue, such as:
- Peripheral artery disease (common in smokers)
- Nutritional deficiencies
- Side effects of medications
- Electrolyte imbalances
- Other medical conditions like diabetes or heart disease

Since you have regular checkups and blood work, it’s important to discuss this new symptom with your doctor. They may want to evaluate your oxygen levels, circulation, and muscle function, and possibly adjust your treatment or recommend physical therapy to improve your exercise tolerance safely.

If you experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling in the legs, or other new symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.","In a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, persistent leg fatigue impairing exercise and walking is most commonly due to **peripheral muscle deconditioning and dysfunction** related to their chronic lung disease. COPD often leads to reduced physical activity, systemic inflammation, and muscle wasting, especially in the lower limbs, causing leg fatigue.

Other considerations include:
- **Hypoxemia-related muscle fatigue** due to impaired oxygen delivery.
- **Peripheral arterial disease** (common in smokers).
- **Medication side effects** (e.g., corticosteroids causing myopathy).
- Less commonly, **cardiac comorbidities** or neurological causes.

However, the most likely diagnosis is **COPD-associated peripheral muscle dysfunction and deconditioning**.

Recommendation: Evaluate oxygenation status, consider exercise rehabilitation, and assess for other causes if symptoms persist or worsen.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Since you are having COPD, your present symptoms of leg pain and fatigue can be due to COPD.Long-standing COPD can have complications like1. Generalized muscle weakness2.

"I am hving bilat lower buttock pain. Increase with lying down. Feels better when walking. I had a mri which showed a lot of dengerative disease. I am a nurse. But at the l5 level it is showing encrouchment of the nerve where I had surgury before. Can surgury help the buttock pain? I have tried the steroid , neurontin without effect. Forget the pain meds those aren t the answer. My doctor said that I will have to live with the pain. OMG I hope not","I'm sorry to hear about your pain. Bilateral lower buttock pain that worsens with lying down and improves with walking, along with MRI findings of degenerative disease and nerve encroachment at L5 (especially post-surgery), suggests nerve root irritation or chronic nerve compression.

Surgery can sometimes help if there is significant nerve compression causing symptoms, but outcomes vary, especially with prior surgery and degenerative changes. Since steroids and neuropathic meds like Neurontin haven't helped, and your doctor suggests conservative management, options may include:

- Physical therapy focused on nerve gliding and strengthening
- Pain management techniques (e.g., nerve blocks, TENS)
- Evaluation by a spine specialist or pain specialist for possible advanced interventions

Surgery is not always guaranteed to relieve pain, especially if nerve damage is chronic or if there is widespread degeneration. A second opinion from a spine surgeon or pain specialist may be helpful to explore all options.

In summary, surgery might help but is not certain; non-surgical treatments and multidisciplinary pain management are important to consider. Please discuss these options with your healthcare providers.","The most likely diagnosis is **recurrent or persistent lumbar radiculopathy due to nerve root compression at the L5 level from degenerative changes and scar tissue after prior surgery**. This is causing bilateral lower buttock pain that worsens with lying down (likely due to nerve irritation or inflammation) and improves with walking.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- MRI shows significant degenerative disease with nerve encroachment at L5.
- Previous surgery at L5 level suggests possible scar tissue or recurrent stenosis.
- Symptoms consistent with nerve root irritation (radiculopathy).
- Lack of response to steroids and gabapentin indicates persistent mechanical compression.

"I have been sick to my stomach and my head feels full like I want to throw up for a couple of weeks now. It started when i started having pain between my shoulder blades. I do have high blood pressure but it is controlled by medication. And this past weekend, i went to sneeze and i had a jarring pain through my shoulder blades and into my neck. I went to the doctor and he said i pulled a muscle. But I am still nauseated and my head feels heavier than it should.","Your symptoms of persistent nausea, a heavy or full feeling in your head, and pain between your shoulder blades—especially after a sudden jarring pain—warrant careful evaluation. While a muscle strain can cause localized pain, ongoing nausea and head heaviness are not typical for a simple muscle pull and could indicate other issues such as:

- Cervical spine problems (e.g., nerve impingement)
- Vestibular or inner ear issues
- Hypertension-related complications
- Gastrointestinal causes
- Neurological conditions

Given your high blood pressure history and persistent symptoms, I strongly recommend you seek prompt medical reassessment. If you develop new symptoms like severe headache, vision changes, weakness, chest pain, or worsening nausea, go to the emergency room immediately. Your doctor may need to perform imaging studies and further tests to determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment.","The patient's symptoms—nausea and a sensation of head fullness persisting for weeks, starting with interscapular pain, and sharp pain radiating to the neck after sneezing—are concerning for more than just muscle strain. While muscle strain can cause localized pain, it typically does not cause persistent nausea or a heavy sensation in the head.

Given the combination of symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is **aortic dissection**, particularly involving the descending thoracic aorta. 

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Pain between the shoulder blades is classic for descending aortic dissection.
- The sudden sharp pain radiating to the neck after sneezing suggests an acute event or worsening.
- Nausea and head fullness may be due to compromised blood flow or early signs of complications.
- History of hypertension is a major risk factor for aortic dissection.

"Hello, a couple years ago I had food poisoning for about 2 days. I was vomiting for a couple days and couldn t hold down any food or even water. I also had red bumps along most of the top side of my palms and wrists. I still get red cracking skin on those areas. What is the condition called and how may I get rid of it? Do I need antibiotics? I use gold bond and eucerin lotion to keep my hands moisturized and it goes away until I wash my hands a few times, so it is only temporary. Any permanent solutions?","Your symptoms of red bumps and cracking skin on the palms and wrists, especially worsening after hand washing, suggest a form of **hand dermatitis (eczema)**, possibly **irritant contact dermatitis** or **allergic contact dermatitis**. The initial food poisoning and vomiting likely triggered a stress or immune response, but the ongoing skin issues are more related to skin barrier damage and irritation.

Key points:
- The red bumps and cracking are typical of eczema.
- Frequent hand washing can worsen the condition by stripping natural oils.
- Moisturizers like Eucerin help but are temporary if the skin barrier is continually disrupted.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Avoid irritants:** Use mild, fragrance-free soaps or cleansers. Avoid harsh detergents or chemicals.
2. **Moisturize frequently:** Apply thick emollients (ointments or creams) immediately after washing hands and throughout the day.
3. **Protect your hands:** Wear gloves when washing dishes or using cleaning products.
4. **Topical steroids:** A mild to moderate topical corticosteroid cream (like hydrocortisone 1%) can reduce inflammation and itching. Use under medical guidance.
5. **Avoid excessive washing:** Use lukewarm water and pat dry instead of rubbing.
6. **See a dermatologist:** For persistent or severe cases, a dermatologist can prescribe stronger topical treatments or investigate for allergic contact dermatitis with patch testing.

**Antibiotics are not needed** unless there is a secondary bacterial infection (signs: increased redness, warmth, pus).

If your symptoms persist or worsen, please consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.","The most likely diagnosis is **chronic hand eczema (irritant contact dermatitis)** triggered or initially precipitated by the acute illness (food poisoning with vomiting) and possibly frequent hand washing.

Explanation:
- The initial episode of vomiting and systemic illness could have led to skin barrier disruption or increased hand washing.
- Red bumps on dorsal palms and wrists evolving into persistent red, cracking skin is characteristic of hand eczema.
- Temporary improvement with moisturizers and worsening after hand washing supports irritant or contact dermatitis.
- Chronic hand eczema is common in patients with repeated exposure to irritants (water, soaps).

Other diagnoses like psoriasis or dyshidrotic eczema are less likely given the history and distribution.

"Hello, I fell going down wide concrete steps four days ago on the ice, and i hit the back of my head pretty hard.  A knot came up on the left parietal bone just above the occipital bone, about the size of a golf ball.  I didnt get knocked out, but couldnt move for a few seconds.  Afterwards, I only experienced a mild - moderate headache. No other symptoms until day 3, a black eye.  My right eyelid is black and purple with some very slight swelling.   Since I havent had any other symptoms of concussion and feel pretty good, I havent considered getting a CTscan.  But now wonder if this black eye is an indication that something could be wrong.  Could this indicate some damage??","The development of a black eye (periorbital ecchymosis) a few days after a head injury, especially when associated with a significant impact to the back of the head, can be concerning. This bruising may indicate a basal skull fracture or bleeding tracking from the site of injury to the front of the face. 

Key points to consider:
- You had a hard impact to the back of your head with a noticeable lump.
- You experienced a brief period of immobility.
- A black eye appeared on the right side, despite the injury being on the left parietal/occipital area.
- Mild to moderate headache but no other neurological symptoms reported.

Given these findings, it is important to seek medical evaluation promptly. A CT scan of the head is often recommended in such cases to rule out:
- Skull fractures (including basal skull fracture)
- Intracranial bleeding (subdural, epidural, or intracerebral hematoma)
- Other brain injuries

Even if you feel generally well, the delayed appearance of a black eye after head trauma is a red flag that warrants urgent assessment by a healthcare professional. If you develop any new symptoms such as worsening headache, confusion, vomiting, weakness, vision changes, or loss of consciousness, go to the emergency room immediately.

**Recommendation:** Please see a doctor or go to the emergency department as soon as possible for a thorough evaluation and likely imaging. Do not delay, as some complications can be serious and require prompt treatment.","The patient's history suggests a head injury with a localized swelling (likely a hematoma or soft tissue swelling) over the left parietal bone and delayed onset of a black eye on the right side.

Key points:
- Fall with direct impact to the back of the head (left parietal/occipital region).
- Immediate swelling (golf ball-sized) at the impact site.
- No loss of consciousness, brief inability to move.
- Mild to moderate headache initially.
- On day 3, development of a black eye on the right side (contralateral to the swelling).
- No other concussion symptoms.

The delayed black eye (periorbital ecchymosis) appearing a few days after a head injury, especially when the impact was on the posterior skull, is characteristic of **Battle's sign** or a related basal skull fracture sign. However, Battle's sign typically appears behind the ear (mastoid ecchymosis), while a black eye (raccoon eyes) is more typical of an anterior or basal skull fracture involving the anterior cranial fossa.

In this case, the black eye is on the right side, while the swelling is on the left parietal bone. This suggests blood tracking from a fracture or bleeding site to the periorbital area on the opposite side.

Most likely diagnosis:
- **Basal skull fracture with delayed periorbital ecchymosis (""raccoon eye"")** secondary to the fall. The swelling over the parietal bone may be a subgaleal hematoma or underlying fracture site.

This is a serious injury that requires urgent imaging (CT head) to evaluate for skull fracture, intracranial hemorrhage, or other complications.

Summary:
- The black eye indicates possible underlying basal skull fracture.
- The patient should be urgently evaluated with neuroimaging.
- Close monitoring for neurological deterioration is essential.

"Hi I ma 23 year old , my question is that I got my period last month on the 18 and it ended on the 22 couple days later I started feeling light cramps on my abdominal , bloating . this month Jan I got my period on the 14 and this one stopped on the 21 it was not heavy , normal the first 3 days and after iit was just spotting and light pink on tissue paper , and also with cramping . I am sexually active with my boyfriend of 7 years we do have two kids 5 and 2. I did take a pregnancy test about 2 weeks ago and it came out negative.. Any suggestions on what it can be ?...","Based on your description, the changes in your menstrual cycle—earlier period this month, lighter flow with spotting, and cramping—could be due to several common causes:

1. **Hormonal fluctuations:** Stress, changes in weight, or lifestyle can affect your cycle.
2. **Ovulation-related spotting:** Some women experience spotting and cramps around ovulation.
3. **Uterine or cervical irritation:** This can cause light bleeding and cramping.

I have been having stabbing pains in my upper right abdomen. I had the procedure where the camera is put down your throat. The doctor found at least 10 polyps which she does not believe is cancer. She is doing a biopsy. She found my stomach is going into my esophagus which could mean cancer now or in the future. I did have breast cancer in 2012 & had a double mastectomy. She said the two would not be linked. I feel hungry all the time but after I eat I feel sick & bloated. I have a lot of dieareah as well. Ulcers have been ruled out. Could this be cancer?,"Your symptoms and findings are concerning and warrant careful evaluation, but they do not definitively indicate cancer at this point. The presence of multiple polyps and stomach tissue extending into the esophagus (likely a hiatal hernia or Barrett's esophagus) can cause symptoms like pain, bloating, and diarrhea. The biopsy results will be crucial to determine if there is any precancerous or cancerous change.

Your history of breast cancer does not directly increase the risk of stomach or esophageal cancer, as your doctor mentioned. However, persistent symptoms like yours should be closely monitored.

Doctor i am 43 year old male. My gamma gt level is 93. My SGOT is 90 and SGPT IS 91. I dont drink alcohol or fizzy drinks. I had typhoid fever for three weeks. I was on antibiotics and paracetamol and ibuprofen. Could these medications be the cause for elevated liver enzymes in blood? How can i bring down these levels?,"Your elevated liver enzymes—Gamma GT (93), SGOT (AST, 90), and SGPT (ALT, 91)—indicate liver inflammation or injury. Since you do not consume alcohol or fizzy drinks, other causes should be considered.

Yes, the antibiotics, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and ibuprofen you took during your typhoid fever can cause liver enzyme elevations, as these medications can be hepatotoxic, especially if taken for a prolonged period or in higher doses.

Recommendations to help bring down your liver enzymes:

1. **Stop or avoid hepatotoxic medications** unless prescribed and monitored by your doctor.
2. **Maintain hydration and a balanced diet** rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
3. **Avoid alcohol and unnecessary medications or supplements** that can stress the liver.
4. **Rest and allow your liver to recover.**
5. **Follow up with your healthcare provider** for repeat liver function tests in 4-6 weeks.
6. **Further evaluation** may be needed to rule out other causes like viral hepatitis, fatty liver, or other liver diseases.

If you develop symptoms like jaundice, severe abdominal pain, or persistent fatigue, seek medical attention promptly.","The elevated liver enzymes (gamma GT, SGOT, SGPT) in this 43-year-old male are likely due to **drug-induced liver injury (DILI)**. 

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Recent use of **antibiotics, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and ibuprofen**, all of which can cause liver enzyme elevation or hepatotoxicity, especially if used for a prolonged period or at higher doses.
- No history of alcohol or fizzy drink consumption, reducing the likelihood of alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
- Recent systemic infection (typhoid) can also cause mild liver enzyme elevation, but the levels here are more consistent with medication effect.
- Gamma GT elevation supports hepatocellular or cholestatic injury, often seen in drug-induced liver damage.

"i am a 27 yr old African american woman who was diagnosed with lichen planus about 4 years ago. it has been treated and i have not had a flare up (thank God)... but i am left with hyperpigmentaton that cover my entire body excluding my face. i have tired every bleaching product available, over the counter and prescribed. i have been tanning and nothing seems to really work. i do have fair skin so the marks are very noticeable. if there is something you can suggest to help or get rid of the hyperpigmentation please advise. Thank you!","Thank you for sharing your history. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) following lichen planus is common, especially in darker skin tones, and can be challenging to treat.

Here are some suggestions to help improve your hyperpigmentation:

1. **Sun Protection:** Even if the marks are on your body, consistent use of broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) is crucial to prevent worsening pigmentation. Avoid intentional tanning, as UV exposure can darken hyperpigmentation.

2. **Topical Treatments:**
   - **Hydroquinone:** Often considered the gold standard for hyperpigmentation. Prescription-strength (4%) hydroquinone can be effective but should be used under dermatologic supervision.
   - **Retinoids:** Topical tretinoin can help by increasing skin turnover and fading pigmentation.
   - **Azelaic Acid:** Useful for PIH and generally well tolerated.
   - **Kojic Acid and Vitamin C:** These have skin-lightening properties and antioxidant effects.
   - Combination creams (e.g., hydroquinone + tretinoin + corticosteroid) may be prescribed for better results.

3. **Procedural Treatments:**
   - **Chemical Peels:** Superficial peels (glycolic acid, salicylic acid) can help reduce pigmentation.
   - **Laser Therapy:** Certain lasers (e.g., Q-switched Nd:YAG) can be effective but must be used cautiously in darker skin to avoid worsening pigmentation.
   - **Microneedling:** Sometimes combined with topical agents to enhance penetration.

4. **Avoid Irritants:** Avoid harsh scrubs or products that can irritate the skin and worsen pigmentation.

5. **Consult a Dermatologist:** Since you have tried many products without success, a dermatologist can tailor a treatment plan, possibly combining topical and procedural therapies safely for your skin type.

Please avoid tanning as it can worsen pigmentation. With patience and proper treatment, improvement is possible, but it may take several months.

If you want, I can help you prepare questions for your dermatologist or suggest over-the-counter options to try in the meantime.","The most likely diagnosis is **erythrodermic (exfoliative) lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP)** or a variant of **lichen planus pigmentosus** with generalized hyperpigmentation.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- History of lichen planus (LP), a chronic inflammatory condition.
- Generalized hyperpigmentation sparing the face, which is unusual for common causes like melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
- Lack of response to bleaching agents and tanning.
- Fair skin making pigmentation more evident.

topic on concussions:My son experienced a concussion in 2008 after being bruttaly beaten up and kicked in the head multiple times with heavy boots. He is experiencing hallucinations getting lower on zyprexa med that he took for bipolar mania after the concussion. Can the visual hallucinations be caused from the lowering of the zyprexa or the concussion? Hes also on equetro.Thank you,"I'm sorry to hear about your son's situation. Both the concussion and changes in medication can potentially cause visual hallucinations.

1. **Concussion effects:** A severe concussion, especially from repeated head trauma, can cause lasting brain changes that may lead to symptoms like hallucinations, cognitive difficulties, mood changes, and other neurological issues.

2. **Medication changes:** Zyprexa (olanzapine) is an antipsychotic used to manage bipolar mania and psychotic symptoms. Lowering the dose can sometimes lead to the return or worsening of symptoms, including hallucinations, especially if the underlying condition is not fully controlled. Equetro (carbamazepine) is a mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant, which also affects brain chemistry.

Given the complexity—history of brain injury plus psychiatric illness and medication adjustments—it's important to consult his psychiatrist or neurologist promptly. They can evaluate whether the hallucinations are due to medication changes, concussion-related brain injury, or a combination, and adjust treatment accordingly.

If hallucinations worsen or are accompanied by other concerning symptoms (confusion, agitation, suicidal thoughts), seek urgent medical attention.","The visual hallucinations in this patient are more likely related to the reduction of Zyprexa (olanzapine) rather than the remote history of concussion from 2008. 

Key points:
- Visual hallucinations can occur as a withdrawal or rebound effect when antipsychotic medications like olanzapine are reduced, especially if the patient has an underlying mood disorder such as bipolar mania.
- While a history of severe head trauma and concussion can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, new-onset visual hallucinations many years later are less commonly directly attributed to the old injury unless there is ongoing structural brain damage or neurodegeneration.
- Carbamazepine (Equetro) is less likely to cause visual hallucinations and is often used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder.
- The most likely diagnosis is **psychotic symptoms (visual hallucinations) related to the reduction of olanzapine in a patient with bipolar disorder**.

Recommendation:
- Careful monitoring and possibly adjusting the antipsychotic dose or adding supportive treatment may be needed.
- Neurological evaluation or brain imaging can be considered if there is suspicion of other causes related to the old head trauma.","Hello thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for your health related queriesYour son developed concussion in 2008, and he developed Bipolar disorder and mania after that. He was no Olanzapine and Carbamazapine for that. Now on lowering the doses he is experiencing hallucinations. Serious head injury commonly get complicated in psychotic symptoms. He is having these symptoms because of complication of head injury and reduction of antipsychotic Zyprexa or Olanzapine resulted in relapse of symptoms. I would advise you to consult his psychiatrist again and get him evaluated for evidence of psychotic symptoms. Thanks, hope this helps you","A patient with a history of a concussion in 2008 following a severe head trauma is currently experiencing visual hallucinations while the dose of Zyprexa (olanzapine), used for bipolar mania, is being reduced. The patient is also taking Equetro (carbamazepine). Could the visual hallucinations be caused by the concussion history or the reduction of Zyprexa? What is the most likely diagnosis?",model_response_conv,model_response_og,doctor_output,"The visual hallucinations in this patient are more likely related to the reduction of Zyprexa (olanzapine) rather than the remote history of concussion from 2008. 

Key points:
- Visual hallucinations can occur as a withdrawal or rebound effect when antipsychotic medications like olanzapine are reduced, especially if the patient has an underlying mood disorder such as bipolar mania.
- While a history of severe head trauma and concussion can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, new-onset visual hallucinations many years later are less commonly directly attributed to the old injury unless there is ongoing structural brain damage or neurodegeneration.
- Carbamazepine (Equetro) is less likely to cause visual hallucinations and is often used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder.
- The most likely diagnosis is **psychotic symptoms (visual hallucinations) related to the reduction of olanzapine in a patient with bipolar disorder**.

Recommendation:
- Careful monitoring and possibly adjusting the antipsychotic dose or adding supportive treatment may be needed.
- Neurological evaluation or brain imaging can be considered if there is suspicion of other causes related to the old head trauma.","I'm sorry to hear about your son's situation. Both the concussion and changes in medication can potentially cause visual hallucinations.

1. **Concussion effects:** A severe concussion, especially from repeated head trauma, can cause lasting brain changes that may lead to symptoms like hallucinations, cognitive difficulties, mood changes, and other neurological issues.

2. **Medication changes:** Zyprexa (olanzapine) is an antipsychotic used to manage bipolar mania and psychotic symptoms. Lowering the dose can sometimes lead to the return or worsening of symptoms, including hallucinations, especially if the underlying condition is not fully controlled. Equetro (carbamazepine) is a mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant, which also affects brain chemistry.

Given the complexity—history of brain injury plus psychiatric illness and medication adjustments—it's important to consult his psychiatrist or neurologist promptly. They can evaluate whether the hallucinations are due to medication changes, concussion-related brain injury, or a combination, and adjust treatment accordingly.

If hallucinations worsen or are accompanied by other concerning symptoms (confusion, agitation, suicidal thoughts), seek urgent medical attention.","Hello thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for your health related queriesYour son developed concussion in 2008, and he developed Bipolar disorder and mania after that. He was no Olanzapine and Carbamazapine for that. Now on lowering the doses he is experiencing hallucinations. Serious head injury commonly get complicated in psychotic symptoms.

These symptoms could indicate a possible infection, constipation, or other complications that need evaluation.

Please contact your healthcare provider or go to the emergency room as soon as possible to get a thorough assessment and appropriate treatment. If you develop fever, heavy bleeding, severe pain, or decreased fetal movement, seek emergency care immediately.","In a 30-week pregnant woman with recent group B streptococcus (GBS) infection who now presents with:

- Shooting pains in the anal area
- Lower abdominal pain
- Shortness of breath when urinating (likely dysuria or urinary symptoms)

The most likely diagnosis is **acute bacterial prostatitis or a urinary tract infection (UTI) complicated by possible pelvic or perineal involvement**.

However, since she is pregnant and has anal pain, another important consideration is **herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection** causing painful perianal lesions, but this is less likely given the GBS context.

More specifically, in pregnancy, GBS colonization can lead to:

- Urinary tract infection (cystitis or pyelonephritis)
- Perineal or pelvic infections

The shooting anal pain and lower abdominal pain suggest possible **pelvic floor or perineal nerve irritation or infection**, possibly from GBS ascending infection.

Shortness of breath when urinating is unusual but may reflect severe dysuria or referred discomfort.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Group B streptococcal urinary tract infection (cystitis or early pyelonephritis) with perineal nerve irritation.**

"Hello. I had four stents put in my heart on 10/2009, and have had no trouble whatsoever since. Ten days ago I thought that I d been bitten by a mosquito just by my shoulder blade as an itch started. This feels like a wire from a stent has come adrift somewhere. This only happens when I m standing but not when I m either sitting down or in bed, and there is no support on my back. Seems like a small prick under my left nipple and at the same time as a prick on my back. I am 76, male, haven t smoked for forty years and blood pressures are usually around 130/70. Cheers. Tom O Farrell","Hello Tom,

Thank you for sharing your symptoms. Given your history of coronary stents and the new sensation of a ""prick"" or ""wire-like"" feeling under your left nipple and near your shoulder blade, especially when standing, it’s important to consider a few possibilities:

1. **Musculoskeletal causes:** Sometimes nerve irritation or muscle strain in the chest or back can cause sharp, localized sensations that change with posture.

2. **Nerve-related issues:** A pinched nerve or nerve irritation in the spine or chest wall can cause prickling or shooting sensations.

3. **Cardiac causes:** Although your stents have been stable for many years and your blood pressure is well controlled, any new chest or back sensations should be evaluated carefully to rule out cardiac ischemia or other heart-related issues.

4. **Other causes:** Skin conditions, such as insect bites or localized nerve irritation, could also cause itching and prickling sensations.

**Recommendations:**

- Since this sensation is new, persistent, and related to posture, I strongly recommend you see your cardiologist or primary care physician promptly for a thorough evaluation.
- They may perform an ECG, physical exam, and possibly imaging or other tests to rule out cardiac or neurological causes.
- If you develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms, seek emergency care immediately.

In the meantime, try to note any other symptoms, their timing, and any activities that worsen or relieve the sensation.

Stay safe, and please get evaluated soon to ensure your heart and nerves are functioning well.

Best wishes for your health,  
Assistant","The patient's description of intermittent, localized ""prick"" sensations under the left nipple and on the back near the shoulder blade, triggered by standing without back support and absent when sitting or lying down, suggests a positional or mechanical cause rather than cardiac ischemia.

Key points:
- History of coronary artery stenting with no current cardiac symptoms.
- Sensations are sensory (prickling/itching), not pain or pressure.
- Symptoms are positional, occurring only when standing unsupported.
- Locations correspond roughly to dermatomes around the chest and upper back (likely T4-T6).
- No systemic symptoms or signs of acute cardiac issues.

Most likely diagnosis: **Intercostal nerve irritation or mild thoracic radiculopathy**, possibly due to postural strain or minor nerve impingement affecting the thoracic spinal nerves or intercostal nerves. This can cause localized paresthesias or pricking sensations in the chest and back dermatomes.

Less likely:
- Cardiac ischemia: usually presents with pain/pressure, not pricking, and not strictly positional.
- Herpes zoster (shingles): would typically have a rash or more persistent pain.
- Musculoskeletal causes: possible but would usually cause pain rather than pricking.

Recommendation:
- Physical exam focusing on spine and chest wall.
- Consider imaging (spine X-ray or MRI) if symptoms persist or worsen.
- Symptomatic treatment with posture correction and possibly neuropathic pain agents if needed.

"I have pain from my shoulder to my elbow, also on the top of my hand. My shoulder feels like a pull or maybe a tendon. Does not hurt all the time, just when I move it wrong. The top of my hand almost feels like cramp, goes into my 2 fingers. This is all on my left side.","Your symptoms—pain from the shoulder to the elbow, a pulling sensation in the shoulder, and cramping with numbness or tingling into two fingers on the top of your hand—suggest possible nerve involvement. This could be due to:

1. **Cervical radiculopathy**: Compression or irritation of a nerve root in the neck (cervical spine) can cause pain radiating down the arm and into the hand, often affecting specific fingers.
2. **Rotator cuff or tendon strain**: The pulling sensation in the shoulder may indicate a tendon or muscle strain.
3. **Peripheral nerve entrapment**: Such as radial or median nerve irritation, which can cause cramping and numbness in the hand and fingers.

Given the combination of shoulder pain and finger symptoms, cervical nerve root irritation is a strong possibility.

**Recommendation:**
- Avoid movements that worsen the pain.
- Apply ice or heat to the shoulder as needed.
- Over-the-counter pain relievers may help.
- See a healthcare provider for a physical exam and possibly imaging (X-ray or MRI) to confirm the diagnosis.
- Early physical therapy may be beneficial.

Key points:
- Shoulder pain with a pulling sensation, intermittent with movement, suggests possible rotator cuff tendinopathy or tendonitis.
- Pain radiating to the dorsum of the hand with cramping into two fingers suggests nerve involvement, likely the radial nerve or possibly C6-C7 cervical radiculopathy.
- The dorsum of the hand is primarily innervated by the radial nerve; cramping in two fingers could correspond to radial nerve distribution or cervical nerve root irritation.

What can be the cause and what is remedy ?,"Your symptoms of burning sensation and slight pain in the upper abdomen, which improve with Rentac (Ranitidine, an acid reducer), suggest that you might be experiencing acid-related issues such as gastritis or mild acid reflux.

Since your sonography is normal, serious structural problems are less likely. However, regular use of Ranitidine or any acid reducer should be done cautiously and under medical supervision, especially at your age, because long-term use can have side effects and may mask other conditions.

**Possible causes:**
- Gastritis (inflammation of stomach lining)
- Acid reflux or mild gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Peptic ulcer (less likely if sonography and symptoms are mild)

**Recommendations:**
1. Consult your doctor or a gastroenterologist for a thorough evaluation.
2. They may suggest an upper GI endoscopy to rule out ulcers or other causes.
3. Avoid irritants like spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and smoking.
4. Eat smaller, frequent meals and avoid lying down immediately after eating.
5. Use acid reducers like Ranitidine only as prescribed. Your doctor may recommend alternatives like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) if needed.

"I have pain in my left shoulder due to cervical disc degeneration. There is a bone spur compression on a nerve that causes shoulder muscle to continuously be contracted on a Charlie horse. Continuous pain. Nerve ablation was unsuccessful due to the bone spur being in the way. Any suggestions? Nerve blocks, cervical epidurals have not worked. Physical therapy did not work. I take flexeril and ibuprofen for pain. Any suggestions?","I'm sorry to hear about your ongoing pain. Given your cervical disc degeneration with a bone spur causing nerve compression and unsuccessful nerve ablation, nerve blocks, epidurals, and physical therapy, here are some potential next steps to discuss with your spine specialist or pain management doctor:

1. **Surgical Evaluation:**  
   - Surgery may be considered to remove the bone spur (foraminotomy or discectomy) to relieve nerve compression. This can potentially alleviate the muscle spasm and pain if conservative treatments have failed.

2. **Alternative Medications:**  
   - Consider medications targeting nerve pain such as gabapentin or pregabalin.  
   - Muscle relaxants like Flexeril can help, but sometimes other agents or combinations may be more effective.

3. **Botox Injections:**  
   - Botulinum toxin injections into the affected shoulder muscles may reduce muscle spasm and pain.

4. **Advanced Pain Management:**  
   - Consult a pain specialist about spinal cord stimulation or other neuromodulation techniques if surgery is not an option.

5. **Multidisciplinary Approach:**  
   - Incorporate pain psychology, acupuncture, or other complementary therapies to help manage chronic pain.

"When I injected I didn t think I missed the vein. It didn t really burn. It swelled up instantly its been maybe over 24 hours and it is pretty swollen , red and pretty painful.. But it s also stiff but very sore all around. It s hard to stretch my arm all the way out. I ve been tryin to google my symptoms but I ve seen so many different things.. I m not a frequent user it was just recreational stuff. So I have know idea what to expect. What do I do","Your symptoms—swelling, redness, pain, stiffness, and difficulty moving your arm more than 24 hours after an injection—are concerning for a possible infection (such as cellulitis) or an inflammatory reaction. This can happen if the injection missed the vein or if bacteria were introduced.

**What you should do:**
- Seek medical attention promptly. You need a healthcare professional to evaluate your arm.
- They may need to examine the area, possibly prescribe antibiotics if there is an infection, and provide pain relief.
- If you develop fever, chills, increasing redness, spreading swelling, or severe pain, go to the emergency room immediately.

Do not try to self-treat or wait longer, as infections can worsen quickly. Avoid using the arm excessively and keep it elevated if possible until you see a doctor.","The most likely diagnosis is **acute cellulitis with possible early abscess formation or soft tissue infection** at the injection site.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Injection of a substance intravascularly or peri-vascularly can introduce bacteria into soft tissues.
- Immediate swelling and progressive redness, pain, and stiffness over 24 hours suggest an inflammatory/infectious process.
- Difficulty extending the arm due to pain and stiffness indicates involvement of deeper soft tissues or early compartment involvement.
- Recreational injection use increases risk of contamination and infection.

"I am a 61 year old male I believe to be in excellent health. The only surgeries I have had is shoulder surgery. For the past several months I ve noticed a gradual limp with my left leg. It s fine in the morning. As I walk on it, it starts to become weak feeling. Left leg feels heavy, almost weighted down. When I lay on my back and raise my left leg straight out, it is weaker than my right leg. When walking rapidly, left leg seems to almost lose control and wants to turn outward. I have had minor chronic lower pain for many years, no surgeries so far (too many auto crashes). Rarely I have minor left knee and hip pain. I attribute this to regular age related pains. When standing to put on pants I can t raise my left leg as high as my right leg without minor discomfort. Help","Your symptoms of a gradually developing limp, left leg weakness that worsens with activity, heaviness, difficulty raising the leg, and occasional outward turning suggest possible neurological or musculoskeletal issues. Given your history of chronic lower back pain and multiple auto crashes, the most likely causes include:

1. **Lumbar spine nerve compression (e.g., lumbar radiculopathy or spinal stenosis):** Nerve root irritation or compression in the lower back can cause leg weakness, heaviness, and altered gait.
2. **Hip or knee joint pathology:** Osteoarthritis or other joint issues can cause pain and functional limitation.
3. **Muscle weakness or imbalance:** Possibly related to nerve issues or disuse.
4. **Peripheral neuropathy or vascular issues:** Less likely but should be considered.

**Recommendations:**
- See a healthcare provider promptly for a thorough neurological and musculoskeletal exam.
- Imaging such as lumbar spine MRI and X-rays of the hip and knee may be needed.
- Physical therapy evaluation to assess gait and muscle strength.
- Avoid activities that worsen symptoms until evaluated.

Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent progression and improve function. If you develop numbness, bowel/bladder changes, or severe pain, seek emergency care immediately.","The patient's presentation suggests a progressive neurological or musculoskeletal issue affecting the left lower extremity, characterized by:

- Gradually worsening limp over several months
- Weakness and heavy sensation in the left leg with walking (suggesting neurogenic or vascular claudication)
- Weakness on straight leg raise on the left side (indicating possible nerve root or muscle weakness)
- Loss of control and outward turning of the left leg during rapid walking (suggesting motor control or nerve dysfunction)
- Mild knee and hip pain, difficulty raising the leg while standing

Given the history of chronic lower back pain from multiple auto accidents and the symptoms worsening with walking but absent in the morning, the most likely diagnosis is **neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis** or a related lumbar radiculopathy.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Symptoms worsen with walking and improve with rest or lying down.
- Weakness on straight leg raise suggests nerve root irritation or compression.
- History of chronic back trauma increases risk of degenerative spine changes causing stenosis.
- Outward turning and loss of control of the leg indicate motor nerve involvement.

Less likely diagnoses include vascular claudication (would not cause weakness or leg control issues), hip/knee arthritis (would cause pain but not neurological weakness), or peripheral neuropathy (usually bilateral and sensory predominant).

**Summary:**  
Most likely diagnosis: **Lumbar spinal stenosis causing neurogenic claudication and left lower extremity radiculopathy.**

"I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed just over two weeks ago. A few days ago, I noticed what I would describe as a white skin tag connected to the side of where one of my teeth were removed. Today I noticed a similar tag on the opposite side of my mouth. It has been a bit painful. What could this be and is it normal?","What you're describing sounds like it could be **oral mucosal tags** or **granulation tissue** forming at the extraction sites. After wisdom teeth removal, it's common for the healing gums to develop some white or pale tissue as part of the normal healing process. However, the presence of a ""white skin tag"" that is painful and appears on both sides is less typical.

Possible explanations include:

1. **Granulation tissue or healing tissue:** This is part of normal healing but usually isn't described as a ""skin tag.""
2. **Irritation fibroma or mucosal tag:** Sometimes, excess tissue can form due to irritation or healing.
3. **Infection or dry socket:** Usually more painful and accompanied by other symptoms like bad odor or severe pain.
4. **Oral candidiasis (thrush):** White patches that can be wiped off, but usually not described as tags.

Since you have pain and new tissue growth, it is important to have this evaluated by your oral surgeon or dentist. They can determine if this is normal healing tissue or if it requires treatment (e.g., removal, biopsy, or antibiotics).

**In summary:** Some white tissue after wisdom tooth removal can be normal, but painful ""tags"" appearing on both sides are not typical and should be checked by a dental professional to rule out infection or other complications. If you experience increased pain, swelling, fever, or pus, seek care promptly.","The most likely diagnosis is **epithelial hyperplasia or hyperplastic granulation tissue (oral mucosal tag)** at the extraction sites. After wisdom tooth extraction, it is common for the healing mucosa to sometimes develop small, white, raised lesions or ""tags"" of excess healing tissue. These can appear as white, skin tag-like growths attached near the extraction sockets.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Occurs a couple of weeks post-extraction during healing.
- White, raised lesions attached to the mucosa near extraction sites.
- Can be mildly painful due to irritation or inflammation.
- Usually benign and self-limiting.

Other less likely considerations:
- Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) typically presents with severe pain and exposed bone, not white tags.
- Oral candidiasis usually presents as removable white plaques, not attached tags.
- Infection or abscess would present with swelling, redness, and more severe pain.

Possible causes include:

- Residual infection or abscess not obvious on the surface
- Dry socket or delayed healing complications
- Nerve irritation or damage
- Cyst or granuloma formation at the extraction site
- Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) issues or muscle inflammation from altered chewing

Rationale:
- Persistent cheek swelling related to eating (mealtime swelling) suggests involvement of the salivary gland or duct.
- The swelling occurs during eating due to increased salivary flow, which is typical for obstructive or inflammatory conditions of the parotid gland.
- History of wisdom tooth extraction in the area could have caused trauma or scarring leading to duct obstruction.
- Absence of pus but presence of mild internal fever and weakness suggests a low-grade or chronic inflammation rather than acute abscess.

"I have got breast cancer, my lymph nodes are clear from the armpit as this was checked when I had the lumpectomy, I have this aching pain in back of my knee, although the sports injury man said it is pulled hamstrings, and I have no lump or swelling, could it have spread to the knee if my lymph nodes are clear in armpit","If your lymph nodes in the armpit are clear and there is no lump or swelling near your knee, it is unlikely that your breast cancer has spread to the knee. Breast cancer typically spreads first to nearby lymph nodes and then to other organs, but isolated pain behind the knee without other signs is more commonly due to musculoskeletal causes like a pulled hamstring.

However, persistent or worsening pain should be evaluated by your oncologist or healthcare provider to rule out other causes and ensure appropriate management. If you have any new symptoms such as swelling, lumps, or systemic signs, seek medical attention promptly.","In a patient with a history of breast cancer and clear axillary lymph nodes post-lumpectomy, aching pain in the back of the knee without any lump or swelling is unlikely to represent metastatic spread. Metastatic breast cancer typically involves lymph nodes first (especially axillary nodes) and commonly metastasizes to bones, lungs, liver, or brain rather than soft tissues like the knee without palpable masses.

The most likely diagnosis for aching pain behind the knee without swelling or lumps is **a benign musculoskeletal cause**, such as:

- **Baker's cyst (popliteal cyst)** (though usually associated with swelling)
- **Hamstring tendonitis or strain**
- **Referred pain from lumbar spine or sciatic nerve irritation**
- **Meniscal or ligamentous knee injury**

Given the absence of swelling or lumps and negative lymph nodes, metastatic disease to the knee is very unlikely.

**Recommendation:** Clinical examination and possibly imaging (e.g., ultrasound or MRI of the knee) can help identify benign causes. If symptoms persist or worsen, further oncologic evaluation may be warranted, but metastatic spread to the knee without other signs is rare.",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. I also think that your knee pain is mostly due to muscular injury.  No need to worry much for cancer spread. Breast cancer tend Mohave bone metastases.  So bones are common site for breast cancer spread. Most commonly involved bone is vertebrae and long bones like femur. Joint involvement is very uncommon.  So no need to worry. But better to rule out this fear by doing ultrasound examination of joint. If this is normal than your pain is mostly due to muscular cause.  So take good painkiller and muscle relaxant.,A patient with a history of breast cancer and clear axillary lymph nodes post-lumpectomy reports aching pain in the back of the knee without any lump or swelling.

However, persistent or worsening pain should be evaluated by your oncologist or healthcare provider to rule out other causes and ensure appropriate management. If you have any new symptoms such as swelling, lumps, or systemic signs, seek medical attention promptly.",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. I also think that your knee pain is mostly due to muscular injury.  No need to worry much for cancer spread. Breast cancer tend Mohave bone metastases.  So bones are common site for breast cancer spread. Most commonly involved bone is vertebrae and long bones like femur. Joint involvement is very uncommon.  So no need to worry. But better to rule out this fear by doing ultrasound examination of joint. If this is normal than your pain is mostly due to muscular cause.  So take good painkiller and muscle relaxant.,"In a patient with a history of breast cancer and clear axillary lymph nodes post-lumpectomy, aching pain in the back of the knee without any lump or swelling is unlikely to represent metastatic spread. Metastatic breast cancer typically involves lymph nodes first (especially axillary nodes) and commonly metastasizes to bones, lungs, liver, or brain rather than soft tissues like the knee without palpable masses.

The most likely diagnosis for aching pain behind the knee without swelling or lumps is **a benign musculoskeletal cause**, such as:

- **Baker's cyst (popliteal cyst)** (though usually associated with swelling)
- **Hamstring tendonitis or strain**
- **Referred pain from lumbar spine or sciatic nerve irritation**
- **Meniscal or ligamentous knee injury**

Given the absence of swelling or lumps and negative lymph nodes, metastatic disease to the knee is very unlikely.

**Recommendation:** Clinical examination and possibly imaging (e.g., ultrasound or MRI of the knee) can help identify benign causes. If symptoms persist or worsen, further oncologic evaluation may be warranted, but metastatic spread to the knee without other signs is rare.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
Hello I recently went to the dentist to get a few cavities filled. After the visit i noticed that the pain in my one tooth was increasing. Yesterday I phoned my dentist at his residence and he prescribed me metronidazole 3x a day. I also have been taking Tylenol 3 and oragel ..when I woke this Morning my lower lip is three times its size. So my question is do i have to be concerned or should i continue with the medication the doctor prescribed?,"Your swollen lower lip, especially after starting new medications, could indicate an allergic reaction or angioedema, which can be serious. You should stop taking the medications immediately and seek urgent medical attention to evaluate the swelling and ensure your airway is not at risk. If you experience difficulty breathing, swallowing, or severe swelling, call emergency services right away. Do not continue the medications until you have been evaluated by a healthcare professional.","The most likely diagnosis is a **dental abscess with associated cellulitis and possible allergic reaction or angioedema**.

Explanation:
- Increasing pain after cavity filling suggests possible pulpitis or infection.
- Prescription of metronidazole indicates the dentist suspected an anaerobic bacterial infection.
- Swelling of the lower lip to three times its normal size, especially if sudden, suggests significant soft tissue inflammation or an allergic reaction.
- The swelling could be due to:
  - Spread of dental infection causing cellulitis or abscess formation.
  - Angioedema, possibly as an allergic reaction to metronidazole, Tylenol 3 (which contains codeine), or Orajel (benzocaine).

Immediate evaluation is needed to:
- Rule out spreading infection threatening the airway.
- Assess for allergic reaction requiring antihistamines or epinephrine.

"Hey Im 15 years old, I have an asymettrical face, I didnt have it when I was young tho, I had braces when I was 13, and I got them taken off last month (14 years old), my face looks asymettrical, my right cheekbone is more prominent than the left, and my right jaw is longer than the left, I dont understand why its like this? It looks terrible in pictures btw","It's not uncommon for facial asymmetry to become more noticeable during adolescence, especially after orthodontic treatment like braces. Your face is still growing and developing at 15, and sometimes the bones and muscles on one side can grow at a different rate than the other, leading to asymmetry.

Braces primarily move teeth and can influence jaw alignment, but they don't usually cause significant bone asymmetry. However, if your bite or jaw alignment changed during treatment, it might make existing asymmetry more noticeable.

Possible reasons for your asymmetry include:

- Natural growth variations during adolescence
- Changes in jaw position or bite after braces
- Muscle imbalances or habits (e.g., chewing more on one side)
- Underlying skeletal differences

If the asymmetry is new, worsening, or causing you concern, it's a good idea to see an orthodontist or an oral and maxillofacial specialist. They can evaluate your jaw growth, bite, and facial structure to determine if further treatment or monitoring is needed.

In the meantime, try not to worry too much—some degree of facial asymmetry is normal and common.","The most likely diagnosis is **mandibular (jaw) asymmetry due to differential growth or remodeling**, possibly related to orthodontic treatment or natural adolescent growth changes.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- The asymmetry developed after early childhood, during adolescence, a period of active facial growth.
- The right cheekbone and jaw appear more prominent/longer, suggesting unilateral overgrowth or asymmetric mandibular development.
- Orthodontic treatment (braces) can sometimes unmask or accentuate underlying skeletal asymmetries as teeth and jaws align.
- No mention of trauma or congenital conditions makes acquired growth asymmetry more likely.

Other considerations (less likely):
- Hemifacial hypertrophy (usually congenital and present earlier)
- TMJ disorders causing functional asymmetry (would often have pain or dysfunction)
- Pathologic lesions (would likely have other symptoms/signs)

"Hi, Im just wondering if I could really benefit from braces or if you think that they would be good for me. Well about twelve months ago at my family dentist appointment I was told that they recommend getting braces to fix a couple of things, but at my recent appointment they didnt say anything about it. Im most likely scheduling an appointment at a local orthodontics soon but I want to get an opinion before going in. The reason I want to get braces is because I just hate how my teeth look. I have a slight overbite and some crooked and spaced out teeth. I think braces could fix it, what do you think? Thanks","Based on what you've described—a slight overbite, crooked teeth, and spacing issues—braces could indeed be beneficial for you. Braces are effective at correcting misaligned teeth, closing gaps, and improving bite issues like overbites. The fact that your family dentist initially recommended braces suggests there is some orthodontic concern, even if it wasn't mentioned at your recent appointment.

Since orthodontic treatment is quite individualized, seeing an orthodontist is a great next step. They can provide a thorough evaluation, including X-rays and impressions, to develop a personalized treatment plan. If your main concern is improving the appearance of your smile and correcting bite alignment, braces or clear aligners are commonly used and effective options.

In summary, braces are likely a good option for addressing your concerns, but a professional orthodontic consultation will give you the most accurate advice tailored to your specific needs.","The most likely diagnosis is **malocclusion with mild overbite and dental spacing/crowding**. This condition often benefits from orthodontic treatment such as braces to correct alignment, improve bite function, and enhance aesthetics.

Since the initial recommendation for braces was made by a family dentist but not reiterated in a recent appointment, it suggests the malocclusion may be mild or borderline. A specialist orthodontic evaluation is appropriate to assess the severity, growth changes, and treatment options.

My assclown doctor wont be in until 1 week from tomorrow and er cost on my insurance is crazy is there anything I can do from home.,"I'm sorry to hear about your painful boil. Here are some steps you can take at home to help manage it:

1. Continue Warm Compresses: Apply a warm, moist compress to the boil for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times a day. This helps increase circulation and may promote drainage.

2. Keep it Clean: Gently wash the area with mild soap and water daily. Avoid squeezing or trying to force more drainage, as this can worsen infection.

3. Use Over-the-Counter Pain Relief: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce pain and inflammation.

4. Avoid Irritation: Wear loose clothing around the neck to prevent friction.

5. Monitor for Signs of Worsening Infection: If you notice increased redness, swelling, warmth, spreading redness, fever, or severe pain, seek medical attention promptly.

"Hi my name is Carmen 22, and recently Ive been having some front bottom teeth irritation and they started to receed not to long ago.. But how do you explain the mouth full of blood when I wake up and theres a clot forming where the gum line receded ? HELP","Hi Carmen, your symptoms of front bottom teeth irritation, gum recession, and waking up with blood and clots at the gum line suggest gum inflammation or early gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis). Gum recession exposes sensitive areas, making bleeding more likely, especially if plaque or tartar buildup irritates the gums.

Possible causes include:
- Poor oral hygiene leading to plaque buildup
- Aggressive brushing or flossing
- Gum infection or inflammation
- Teeth grinding or trauma

I recommend:
1. Seeing a dentist promptly for a thorough exam and cleaning.
2. Improving oral hygiene: gentle brushing twice daily with a soft brush, flossing daily.
3. Avoiding aggressive brushing or harsh mouthwashes.
4. Monitoring for other symptoms like pain, swelling, or loose teeth.

Early treatment can prevent progression. If bleeding is heavy or persistent, seek urgent dental care.","The most likely diagnosis is **necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG)** or **necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP)**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Young adult female.
- Recent irritation and gum recession localized to lower front teeth.
- Waking up with bleeding and clot formation at the recession site.
- NUG/NUP typically presents with painful, bleeding gums, ulceration, and necrosis of interdental papillae.
- Often associated with poor oral hygiene, stress, smoking, or immunosuppression.

Other possibilities like aggressive periodontitis or traumatic gingival recession are less likely given the acute bleeding and clot formation.

The receded gums and bleeding is because of the gum infection secondary to deposits. Consult your dentist get your teeth cleaned. Maintain oral hygiene, use mouth wash, brush twice daily. Whatever damage has occurred till now, but further damage can be prevented. Once in a year get your teeth cleaned. I hope my answer will help you. Take care.","Hi Carmen, your symptoms of front bottom teeth irritation, gum recession, and waking up with blood and clots at the gum line suggest gum inflammation or early gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis). Gum recession exposes sensitive areas, making bleeding more likely, especially if plaque or tartar buildup irritates the gums.

Possible causes include:
- Poor oral hygiene leading to plaque buildup
- Aggressive brushing or flossing
- Gum infection or inflammation
- Teeth grinding or trauma

I recommend:
1. Seeing a dentist promptly for a thorough exam and cleaning.
2. Improving oral hygiene: gentle brushing twice daily with a soft brush, flossing daily.
3. Avoiding aggressive brushing or harsh mouthwashes.
4. Monitoring for other symptoms like pain, swelling, or loose teeth.

Early treatment can prevent progression. If bleeding is heavy or persistent, seek urgent dental care.","The most likely diagnosis is **necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG)** or **necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP)**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Young adult female.
- Recent irritation and gum recession localized to lower front teeth.
- Waking up with bleeding and clot formation at the recession site.
- NUG/NUP typically presents with painful, bleeding gums, ulceration, and necrosis of interdental papillae.
- Often associated with poor oral hygiene, stress, smoking, or immunosuppression.

Other possibilities like aggressive periodontitis or traumatic gingival recession are less likely given the acute bleeding and clot formation.

**Recommendation:** Urgent dental evaluation for debridement, improved oral hygiene, and possible antibiotic therapy.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"After eating certain fruits and vegtables (raw carrots, corn on the cob, blueberries, etc) I sometimes have back pain (in the middle right wear my bra strap is ) and upper abdominal pain .

I have had this problem for about ten years. I get these attacks maybe two or three times a year and it always seem to be brought on by the foods I mentioned above. thank you for any suggestions as to what my problem","Your symptoms of back pain (middle right side), upper abdominal pain radiating from back to front, gas buildup, and burping after eating certain fruits and vegetables suggest a possible digestive issue. Given the specific trigger foods (raw carrots, corn, blueberries) and the nature of your symptoms, some possible causes include:

1. **Food Intolerance or Sensitivity:** Some people have difficulty digesting certain fibers or sugars in raw vegetables and fruits, leading to gas, bloating, and pain.

2. **Gallbladder Issues:** Pain in the upper right abdomen and back can be related to gallbladder problems such as gallstones or biliary colic, especially if triggered by fatty or fibrous foods.

3. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** IBS can cause gas, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits triggered by certain foods.

4. **Pancreatic or Gastric Causes:** Less commonly, pancreatic or stomach issues can cause referred pain to the back and upper abdomen.

Given the long duration (10 years) and episodic nature, it is important to get a thorough evaluation. I recommend:

- Seeing a healthcare provider for a detailed history and physical exam.
- Possibly undergoing abdominal ultrasound to check gallbladder and liver.
- Considering tests for food intolerances or allergies.
- Keeping a food diary to track triggers and symptoms.

If you experience worsening pain, jaundice, fever, or vomiting, seek urgent medical care.

In summary, your symptoms likely relate to a digestive or biliary issue triggered by certain foods, but proper medical evaluation is needed for diagnosis and management.","The patient's episodic pain in the right mid-back and upper abdomen, lasting hours and recurring over years, triggered by certain raw fruits and vegetables, along with associated gas and burping, suggests a gastrointestinal etiology related to food intolerance or malabsorption.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Fructose or sorbitol intolerance / FODMAP sensitivity causing episodic functional gastrointestinal symptoms**

**Rationale:**  
- Pain location (upper abdomen and back) and radiation can be referred from the stomach, duodenum, or pancreas, but the episodic nature and association with gas and burping point toward functional GI disturbance rather than structural disease.  
- Triggering by raw fruits and vegetables (carrots, corn, blueberries) suggests intolerance to fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), which can cause gas, bloating, and pain due to fermentation in the gut.  
- The long duration and low frequency of episodes are typical of functional GI disorders rather than acute or progressive organic disease.  
- No mention of weight loss, severe systemic symptoms, or continuous pain reduces likelihood of peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, or malignancy.

**Next steps:**  
- Trial of a low-FODMAP diet to confirm symptom improvement.  
- Consider hydrogen breath testing for fructose or sorbitol intolerance.  
- If symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation with imaging or endoscopy may be warranted.

He explained this morning he accidentally took his regular 10mg of Paxil, forgot, (He says) & took a second 10 mg dose this morning. Also, prescribed Ativan ,which he did take this afternoon; does not seem to alleviate aggression symptoms. Has left for the evening w/friend to stay overnight. Is it possible the add. 10 mg s has made his behavior more unmanageable? Thank You for any assistance to help me.","I'm sorry to hear about your grandson's struggles. Taking an extra 10 mg dose of Paxil (paroxetine) in one day can increase side effects such as agitation, anxiety, irritability, and mood changes, which might explain his increased aggression and agitation today. Additionally, Ativan (lorazepam) is a sedative that may not immediately counteract these symptoms, especially if the Paxil dose was doubled.

Given his history of PTSD and current symptoms, it is important to monitor him closely. If his aggression worsens, he becomes a danger to himself or others, or if you notice severe symptoms like confusion, hallucinations, or suicidal thoughts, seek emergency medical help immediately.

For now:
- Encourage him to avoid taking extra doses.
- Keep communication open and calm.
- Contact his prescribing doctor or mental health provider as soon as possible to inform them of the double dose and current symptoms.
- If you feel unsafe or his behavior escalates, do not hesitate to call emergency services.

While SSRIs like Paxil can, in some cases, cause behavioral activation or increased irritability, this is more common when starting the medication or adjusting doses over days to weeks, not typically from a single extra dose.

Given the patient's history of PTSD and recent increase in aggression, the most likely diagnosis is an exacerbation or acute worsening of PTSD symptoms, possibly with comorbid agitation or a mood dysregulation episode. The presence of trauma-related stressors and the patient's background support this.

"I have brown patches on the back and the neck. They started spreading over my shoulders and to my stomach. They appear white after I take a shower but otherwise appear as brown patches when dry. I had this few years ago, back then I consulted a doctor and I was given medication. Now I have moved to a new country and I consulted a physician who ruled out fungal infection. Not sure what it is.","The symptoms you describe—brown patches on the back, neck, shoulders, and stomach that appear white after showering and brown when dry—are characteristic of **tinea versicolor** (also called pityriasis versicolor). This is a common superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia yeast, which can cause hypopigmented or hyperpigmented patches that may become more noticeable with sweating or after bathing.

However, since your current physician has ruled out a fungal infection, other possibilities include:

- **Pityriasis alba**: Usually hypopigmented patches, more common in children.
- **Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation**: Following skin inflammation.
- **Vitiligo**: Usually depigmented (white) patches, not brown.
- **Eczema or dermatitis**: Can cause discoloration but usually with itching and inflammation.
- **Other pigmentary disorders**.

Given your history and the pattern of color change after showering, tinea versicolor remains the most likely diagnosis despite the recent physician's opinion. Sometimes fungal tests can be falsely negative.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider seeing a dermatologist for a skin scraping and KOH test or Wood's lamp examination to confirm or exclude tinea versicolor.
- If confirmed, antifungal treatments (topical or oral) are effective.
- Avoid excessive heat and sweating, which can worsen the condition.

If you notice other symptoms like itching, scaling, or if the patches change rapidly, seek prompt dermatological evaluation.","The presentation of brown patches that turn white after showering, spreading over the back, neck, shoulders, and stomach, with a history of a similar episode, and a recent exclusion of fungal infection, is most consistent with **Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor)**.

- Brown or hypopigmented patches.
- Color changes with moisture (white after showering).
- Recurrence is common.
- Fungal infection ruled out recently, but sometimes KOH prep or fungal cultures can be falsely negative or the patient may have been partially treated.

However, since fungal infection was ruled out by a physician, another possibility is **Idiopathic Guttate Hypomelanosis** or **Post-inflammatory Hypopigmentation**, but these usually do not show color changes with showering.

Given the classic description, the most likely diagnosis remains **Pityriasis Versicolor**, possibly with a negative fungal test due to prior treatment or sampling error.

No problem in breathing also. Can you guide me what to do further.","Your symptoms of mild, intermittent pain in the left lower chest and shoulder, with normal blood sugar, BP, cholesterol, thyroid, and ECG, and no breathing difficulty, are reassuring but still warrant careful evaluation.

Possible causes include:
- Musculoskeletal pain (e.g., muscle strain, costochondritis)
- Nerve irritation or referred pain from the neck or spine
- Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., acid reflux)
- Less likely cardiac causes given normal ECG and no other symptoms

Recommendations:
1. Monitor the pain: note triggers, duration, and any new symptoms.
2. Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity that may strain muscles.
3. Consider over-the-counter pain relief (e.g., acetaminophen or NSAIDs) if no contraindications.

"My son has had high fever for about 10 days. He is 4 years old and weighs 20kg. He had a running nose a week before he got fever. In the initial few days fever was around 102-103 in the armpit. After about 3 days of fever we gave him an anitbiotic (azithral). The fever didnt get better. It would get better when we gave crocin or meftal. Now we are using another anitbiotic calle Keflor. In the last two days, when we give crocin or meftal, the fever stays down for about 9hrs and starts to come back. We are on day 3 of a 5-day keflor course. We are wondering if we should get a blood test done. He is not eating much.","A high fever lasting 10 days in a 4-year-old child, especially not responding well to antibiotics, is concerning and warrants further evaluation. The initial symptoms of runny nose followed by prolonged fever suggest a possible viral infection or a secondary bacterial infection that may not be covered by the current antibiotics.

Given that:
- Fever has persisted for 10 days.
- Fever temporarily reduces with antipyretics but returns.
- Antibiotics (azithral and now Keflor) have not resolved the fever.
- Your son is not eating well.

It is important to get a thorough medical evaluation as soon as possible. A blood test is advisable to check for:
- Complete blood count (CBC) to look for signs of infection or inflammation.
- Inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR).
- Blood culture if bacterial infection is suspected.
- Possibly other tests like urine analysis or chest X-ray depending on clinical examination.

Please take your son to a pediatrician or emergency care promptly for a full assessment. Prolonged fever in children can indicate serious infections or other conditions that need timely diagnosis and treatment. Do not delay seeking medical care.","Key points in this case:
- 4-year-old boy with prolonged high fever (~10 days)
- Initial upper respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea) 1 week before fever onset
- Fever 102-103°F, persistent despite azithromycin and currently on cefaclor
- Fever temporarily reduced by antipyretics but recurs
- Decreased appetite

Prolonged fever in a child with initial URI symptoms and no response to antibiotics suggests a non-bacterial cause or a more specific diagnosis.

Most likely diagnoses to consider:
1. **Kawasaki disease** – prolonged fever >5 days, often with mucocutaneous symptoms (not mentioned here)
2. **Viral infections** – but 10 days of high fever is less common
3. **Typhoid fever** – can cause prolonged fever, but no mention of GI symptoms
4. **Infectious mononucleosis** – usually with lymphadenopathy, sore throat
5. **Tuberculosis** – possible but less likely without other symptoms
6. **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis or other inflammatory conditions** – usually with other signs
7. **Post-viral or atypical bacterial infections** (e.g., Mycoplasma, but azithromycin was given without improvement)
8. **Malaria or other tropical infections** – depending on travel history

Given the prolonged fever, initial URI symptoms, no response to macrolide or cephalosporin, and no other focal signs, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Kawasaki disease** (especially if other signs like conjunctivitis, rash, lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane changes are present but not mentioned here).

If no other signs of Kawasaki disease are present, consider:

**Viral infection with prolonged fever or atypical infection**.

Recommendation:
- Careful clinical examination for Kawasaki disease signs
- Laboratory tests: CBC, ESR, CRP, liver enzymes, urine analysis
- Echocardiogram if Kawasaki disease suspected
- Consider referral to pediatric specialist

**Summary:**  
Most likely diagnosis is **Kawasaki disease** given prolonged high fever >5 days in a child, especially if other clinical signs are present. If absent, consider other causes of prolonged fever and further evaluation is needed.","Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics like Literal at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics like Literal at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.","Key points in this case:
- 4-year-old boy with prolonged high fever (~10 days)
- Initial upper respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea) 1 week before fever onset
- Fever 102-103°F, persistent despite azithromycin and currently on cefaclor
- Fever temporarily reduced by antipyretics but recurs
- Decreased appetite

Prolonged fever in a child with initial URI symptoms and no response to antibiotics suggests a non-bacterial cause or a more specific diagnosis.

Most likely diagnoses to consider:
1. **Kawasaki disease** – prolonged fever >5 days, often with mucocutaneous symptoms (not mentioned here)
2. **Viral infections** – but 10 days of high fever is less common
3. **Typhoid fever** – can cause prolonged fever, but no mention of GI symptoms
4. **Infectious mononucleosis** – usually with lymphadenopathy, sore throat
5. **Tuberculosis** – possible but less likely without other symptoms
6. **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis or other inflammatory conditions** – usually with other signs
7. **Post-viral or atypical bacterial infections** (e.g., Mycoplasma, but azithromycin was given without improvement)
8. **Malaria or other tropical infections** – depending on travel history

Given the prolonged fever, initial URI symptoms, no response to macrolide or cephalosporin, and no other focal signs, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Kawasaki disease** (especially if other signs like conjunctivitis, rash, lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane changes are present but not mentioned here).

If no other signs of Kawasaki disease are present, consider:

**Viral infection with prolonged fever or atypical infection**.

Recommendation:
- Careful clinical examination for Kawasaki disease signs
- Laboratory tests: CBC, ESR, CRP, liver enzymes, urine analysis
- Echocardiogram if Kawasaki disease suspected
- Consider referral to pediatric specialist

**Summary:**  
Most likely diagnosis is **Kawasaki disease** given prolonged high fever >5 days in a child, especially if other clinical signs are present. If absent, consider other causes of prolonged fever and further evaluation is needed.","A high fever lasting 10 days in a 4-year-old child, especially not responding well to antibiotics, is concerning and warrants further evaluation. The initial symptoms of runny nose followed by prolonged fever suggest a possible viral infection or a secondary bacterial infection that may not be covered by the current antibiotics.

Given that:
- Fever has persisted for 10 days.
- Fever temporarily reduces with antipyretics but returns.
- Antibiotics (azithral and now Keflor) have not resolved the fever.
- Your son is not eating well.

It is important to get a thorough medical evaluation as soon as possible. A blood test is advisable to check for:
- Complete blood count (CBC) to look for signs of infection or inflammation.
- Inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR).
- Blood culture if bacterial infection is suspected.
- Possibly other tests like urine analysis or chest X-ray depending on clinical examination.

Please take your son to a pediatrician or emergency care promptly for a full assessment. Prolonged fever in children can indicate serious infections or other conditions that need timely diagnosis and treatment. Do not delay seeking medical care.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
I have a lump about the size of a dime and its oval shaped. Its right between my vagina and my inner thigh. There is no head on it and it isn t hard. It doesn t hurt unless I mess with it and its red. I don t know what to do because I don t have insurance to go to the doctor. How do I get rid of it ? What could it be ?,"Based on your description—a painless, oval, red lump about the size of a dime located between the vagina and inner thigh—it could be one of several things, such as:

- An ingrown hair or irritated hair follicle  
- A cyst (like a sebaceous cyst)  
- A swollen lymph node  
- A benign skin growth or boil  

Since it is not hard, not painful unless touched, and red, it may be an inflamed cyst or follicle.

**What you can do:**  
- Keep the area clean and dry.  
- Avoid squeezing or picking at the lump to prevent infection.  
- Apply a warm compress for 10-15 minutes a few times a day to help reduce inflammation and encourage drainage if it is a cyst.  
- Wear loose, breathable clothing to avoid irritation.

**When to seek medical care:**  
- If the lump grows rapidly, becomes very painful, or shows signs of infection (increased redness, warmth, pus, fever).  
- If it does not improve or goes away within 1-2 weeks.

**If you don’t have insurance:**  
- Look for free or low-cost clinics in your area (community health centers, Planned Parenthood, or local health departments).  
- Some clinics offer sliding scale fees based on income.

If you notice worsening symptoms or are concerned, it’s important to get evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out other conditions.","The most likely diagnosis is a **Bartholin gland cyst** or abscess.

"hi, ive had to much amphetamine speed. my heart is really going and im gettin a tad scared. is there anything i can do to try slow the heart rate.?... i dont want to go into hospital or anything, i just want to enquire what advice you can give me... thanks, ashley pitts","Hi Ashley, if your heart is racing after taking too much amphetamine, this can be serious. Here are some steps you can try immediately:

- Sit or lie down in a calm, quiet place to help reduce stimulation.
- Practice slow, deep breathing to help slow your heart rate.
- Avoid any more stimulants like caffeine.
- Stay hydrated with water.

However, a very fast or irregular heartbeat can be dangerous. If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, or if your heart rate remains very high or irregular, you should seek emergency medical help immediately. It’s important not to ignore these symptoms. If you feel very unwell, please go to the hospital or call emergency services.

Recommendations:
- Continue cleaning gently with saline solution twice daily.
- Avoid touching or pulling on the piercing.
- Apply a warm compress to reduce swelling.
- Monitor for worsening symptoms such as increased redness, yellow/green pus, fever, or spreading redness.

"I had surgery to correct a hiatal hernia and acid reflux a year ago this past Nov. and ever since, I have difficulty breathing just about every other day. Prior to surgery, it was more frequent. I sleep on a wedge pillow, plus another standard pillow to prevent acid coming up, and I eat by 5:30 to give adequate time for food to digest (this has helped tremendously to the point where I don t need medication regularly, but wonder why it happens every other day and is there anything else I can do? And is it happening because acid comes up to my airway and creates swelling? PS--my pulmonologist prescribed inhalers, but it brought no relief whatsoever.","Your difficulty breathing occurring every other day after hiatal hernia and acid reflux surgery could be related to several factors:

1. **Residual or Recurrent Acid Reflux:** Even after surgery, some acid reflux can persist or recur, potentially irritating your airway and causing inflammation or swelling, which may lead to breathing difficulties.

2. **Aspiration or Microaspiration:** Acid or stomach contents may occasionally enter the airway, causing irritation and inflammation, contributing to breathing problems.

3. **Post-Surgical Changes:** The surgery itself can sometimes alter the anatomy or motility of the esophagus and stomach, potentially affecting breathing or causing symptoms that mimic respiratory issues.

4. **Non-Acid Reflux or Other Causes:** Sometimes non-acid reflux or other conditions like asthma, vocal cord dysfunction, or anxiety can cause similar symptoms.

Since inhalers prescribed by your pulmonologist have not helped, it suggests the breathing difficulty may not be primarily due to asthma or typical airway inflammation.

**Recommendations:**

- **Follow-up with your gastroenterologist and pulmonologist:** They may consider further testing such as pH monitoring, esophageal manometry, or laryngoscopy to assess for ongoing reflux or airway inflammation.

- **Consider a trial of anti-reflux medications:** Even if you are off regular medication, a short course of proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers might help reduce any residual acid reflux.

- **Avoid triggers:** Continue eating early, avoid late meals, and maintain head elevation during sleep.

- **Evaluate for other causes:** Your doctors may assess for other respiratory or functional causes of your symptoms.

In summary, your breathing difficulty could be related to ongoing reflux irritating your airway, but other causes should be ruled out. Close follow-up with your healthcare providers is important to tailor treatment and further evaluate your symptoms.","The patient's history of hiatal hernia and acid reflux, along with breathing difficulty that occurs intermittently and improved with reflux management measures, suggests that the breathing difficulty is likely due to **laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)** or reflux-related airway irritation.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Hiatal hernia and acid reflux can cause reflux of stomach contents into the larynx and airway, leading to inflammation and swelling.
- Symptoms such as breathing difficulty that do not respond to inhalers (which treat asthma or bronchospasm) suggest a non-asthmatic cause.
- Improvement with measures that reduce reflux (elevated sleeping position, early meals) supports reflux as the underlying cause.
- LPR can cause symptoms like chronic cough, throat clearing, hoarseness, and breathing difficulty due to upper airway inflammation.

"I have been on Provastatin for over 10 years and am now having pain in my left hip/upper thigh. I am on Mobic for degenerative joints in the neck, lower back, knee and elbow. Should I ASSUME this is probably another joint with degenerative changes? The Mobic is NOT helping that particular joint.","Pain in the left hip/upper thigh in a patient on pravastatin (a statin) for over 10 years could be due to several causes:

1. **Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS):** Statins can cause muscle pain or weakness, sometimes mimicking joint pain. This can occur even after long-term use.
2. **Degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis):** Given your history of degenerative joints, this is a possible cause.
3. **Other causes:** Tendinopathy, bursitis, or referred pain from the lower back.

Since Mobic (meloxicam) is not helping, and because statins can cause muscle-related side effects, it is important not to assume this is just another degenerative joint issue without further evaluation.

**Recommended next steps:**
- See your healthcare provider for a thorough assessment.
- They may check muscle enzymes (e.g., CK) to evaluate for statin-related muscle injury.
- Imaging (X-ray or MRI) of the hip may be needed to assess joint degeneration.
- Your provider may consider adjusting your medications or trying alternative treatments.

Do not stop pravastatin without medical advice. Prompt evaluation is important to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.","In a patient with long-term pravastatin use and new onset of hip and upper thigh pain not relieved by meloxicam, the most likely diagnosis is **statin-associated myopathy**, including possible statin-induced muscle pain or weakness.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Statins (like pravastatin) can cause muscle-related side effects, including myalgia, myopathy, or rarely, rhabdomyolysis.
- Muscle pain from statins often affects proximal muscles such as the hip and thigh.
- NSAIDs like meloxicam typically do not relieve muscle pain caused by statins.
- Degenerative joint disease usually causes joint-specific pain and stiffness, often relieved partially by NSAIDs, and less commonly causes isolated thigh muscle pain.

Recommendation:
- Evaluate creatine kinase (CK) levels to assess muscle injury.
- Consider discontinuing or switching statin therapy after consultation with the prescribing physician.

Precum would have a very hard time passing through two layers of clothing, and if you didn't directly touch your penis or have precum on your fingers, the likelihood of sperm being transferred is minimal. Pregnancy typically requires sperm to be deposited inside the vagina.

If you want to be extra cautious, your girlfriend can consider tracking her cycle or using emergency contraception if she feels it's necessary and it's within the appropriate time frame. But overall, from your description, the risk is negligible. If you have further concerns, consulting a healthcare provider can provide personalized reassurance.","The scenario describes a concern about pregnancy risk from indirect contact with pre-ejaculate (precum) via fingers after genital contact over clothing.

**Key points:**
- No direct genital-to-genital contact.
- Genital contact was over two layers of clothing (briefs and shorts), which is a significant barrier.
- Any precum on fingers would have had to transfer through clothing to the partner's genital area.
- The patient resumed digital stimulation after adjusting himself, but the likelihood of viable sperm surviving and being transferred in this manner is extremely low.

**Most likely diagnosis/assessment:**
- **No significant risk of pregnancy in this scenario.**
- The presence of sperm in precum is possible but usually in very small amounts.
- Sperm do not survive well on dry surfaces or through multiple layers of clothing.
- Pregnancy from such indirect contact is highly unlikely.

"I had my gallbladder removed laparoscopicly on Thursday. 4 days later I have a small irritation in my throat causing me to cough. When I cough some phlegm comes up with a small amt id red blood mixed (bright red). The breathing tube was left in longer than usual due to shallow breaths, causing a panic attack. Should I be concerned?","It's not uncommon to have throat irritation and a mild cough after general anesthesia with intubation, especially if the breathing tube was in longer than usual. The presence of some phlegm with a small amount of bright red blood can be due to minor irritation or small trauma to the throat or airway during intubation.

However, you should be cautious if you experience any of the following:
- Increasing amount or persistent bright red blood in phlegm
- Difficulty breathing or worsening shortness of breath
- Severe throat pain or swelling
- Fever or signs of infection
- Chest pain

If your symptoms are mild and improving, it is likely related to the intubation and should resolve in a few days. If you are concerned or symptoms worsen, please contact your healthcare provider promptly for evaluation.","The most likely diagnosis is **tracheal or laryngeal mucosal irritation or minor trauma from prolonged endotracheal intubation**.

Explanation:
- The patient had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
- Prolonged intubation can cause irritation, inflammation, or minor injury to the tracheal or laryngeal mucosa.
- This leads to throat irritation, cough, and production of sputum with small amounts of bright red blood (indicating minor mucosal bleeding).
- The timing (4 days post-op) and symptoms fit well with this cause rather than infection or other complications.

No signs of severe respiratory distress or infection are described, making more serious causes like pneumonia or pulmonary embolism less likely here.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor.

Hi My sister was rushed to the ER vomiting blood and melena. She is a 30 yr Hep C survivor without interferon . She decided to go the holistic route. MRI yesterday indicated nodules on her liver without concern for mets. She is scheduled for liver biopsy of nodules tomorrow. How concerning is this for liver cancer? She is presently asymptomatic from original ER symptoms. Also having CT scan tomorrow. Thanks,"Vomiting blood (hematemesis) and melena (black, tarry stools) indicate upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which in a patient with a history of Hepatitis C and liver nodules raises concern for complications such as variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension or bleeding from a liver tumor.

Key points:
- Hepatitis C survivors, especially with liver nodules, are at increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
- Nodules on MRI warrant further evaluation; biopsy and CT scan are appropriate next steps.
- Absence of metastases on MRI is reassuring but does not exclude early liver cancer.
- Upper GI bleeding in this context may be related to portal hypertension (varices) or tumor bleeding.

Recommendations:
- The liver biopsy and CT scan will provide more definitive information about the nature of the nodules.
- Close monitoring and management of bleeding sources are critical.
- Early involvement of hepatology and oncology specialists is important.

In summary, the presence of liver nodules in a Hep C survivor is concerning for possible liver cancer, but biopsy and imaging will clarify diagnosis. The bleeding episode is serious and requires urgent evaluation and treatment.","The most likely diagnosis is **cirrhosis with portal hypertension complicated by esophageal variceal bleeding**.

Explanation:
- History of hepatitis C infection is a common cause of chronic liver disease leading to cirrhosis.
- Hepatic nodules on MRI likely represent regenerative nodules or early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), both seen in cirrhosis.
- Hematemesis and melena indicate upper gastrointestinal bleeding, commonly from esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients due to portal hypertension.
- The absence of metastases and planned liver biopsy/CT scan suggest evaluation for liver pathology and possible HCC.

I have a small lump in my right armpit that is tender/sore and mid back pain on my right side.  This has been on going for 4 to 6 weeks...was told possible bactierial infection(possibly cat scratch fever) and I was given a z-pack last week and the lump is still there. What could this be? Thank you!,"A tender lump in the armpit along with localized pain can be caused by several conditions, including:

1. **Infection or Abscess:** If the lump is due to an infection (like cat scratch disease caused by Bartonella henselae), it may take longer than a week to fully respond to antibiotics. Sometimes, the infection can form an abscess that may require drainage.

2. **Lymphadenopathy:** Enlarged lymph nodes due to infections, inflammation, or other causes can persist for weeks.

3. **Other causes:** Less commonly, lumps can be due to cysts, benign tumors, or rarely malignancy.

Given that the lump has persisted despite a course of antibiotics and you have ongoing pain, it is important to follow up with your healthcare provider. They may recommend:

- Further evaluation with blood tests or imaging (ultrasound of the armpit).
- Possible biopsy or aspiration if the lump does not improve.
- Reassessment for other causes beyond bacterial infection.

If you develop fever, increasing pain, redness, or if the lump grows, seek medical attention promptly.

In summary, persistent tender armpit lump after antibiotics warrants re-evaluation to rule out abscess, other infections, or other causes. Please see your healthcare provider for further assessment.","The presentation of a small, tender lump in the right armpit (axillary lymphadenopathy) along with localized mid-back pain on the right side, persisting for 4 to 6 weeks despite treatment with azithromycin (Z-pack) for possible bacterial infection including cat scratch disease, suggests that the initial diagnosis may be incomplete or incorrect.

**Most likely diagnosis:**
- **Tuberculous (TB) lymphadenitis or atypical mycobacterial infection**: These infections can cause persistent, tender lymphadenopathy that does not resolve with standard antibiotics like azithromycin.
- **Other considerations:** 
  - Persistent bacterial lymphadenitis resistant to initial treatment
  - Lymphoma or other malignancy (less likely if tender and acute, but should be considered if persistent)
  - Fungal infections or other granulomatous diseases

Given the chronicity and lack of response to treatment, further workup is warranted, including:
- Lymph node biopsy or fine needle aspiration for histopathology and culture (including mycobacterial cultures)
- Imaging (ultrasound or CT) of the axilla and chest
- Tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for TB

"Hi, my neck has been hurting all the way down to my lower shoulder blade. i recently played tennis and handball all in the same day for a couple of hours, and upon waking up the next morning i couldn t move my shoulder whatsoever. It got slightly better over time. What can it possibly be?","Your symptoms of neck pain radiating down to the lower shoulder blade, combined with sudden inability to move the shoulder after intense physical activity, suggest a possible muscle strain or soft tissue injury, such as:

- **Cervical muscle strain or sprain**: Overuse or sudden movement during tennis and handball can strain neck muscles.
- **Rotator cuff injury or shoulder muscle strain**: Inability to move the shoulder points to possible shoulder muscle involvement.
- **Cervical radiculopathy**: Nerve irritation or compression in the neck causing pain radiating to the shoulder blade.
- **Shoulder impingement or bursitis**: Inflammation causing pain and limited movement.

If pain persists, worsens, or is accompanied by numbness, tingling, or weakness, you should see a healthcare professional for a physical exam and possibly imaging studies. Meanwhile, rest, gentle neck and shoulder stretches, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers may help.

"I have bi lateral scapular winging, have had bi lateral superior pole scapular excisions w/ reattchment of levator serratus and levator scap. On the right side I have very little range of motion. I have been dealing with this for 9 years. I am on 150 of Fentanyl, Vistaril, Ativan, Zanaflex, 8 mg of dilaudid for breakthrough pain, which is needed 3 times a day. I have never been seen by my doctors to have an issue with pain meds, I do not doctor shop, but even though the pain meds are the lesser of 2 evils, I need to find someone in the Minneapolis area who can treat me. I have been all over the country, they are either doubtful of surgical success, or afraid I will want them to take on my pain management, which is not true. I am 34 yrs old, female happily married, was a Medical Lab Tech, but havent worked since 03. I need to get my life back. How do I do that?","I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing. Bilateral scapular winging with limited range of motion and chronic pain after multiple surgeries is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Here are some steps to help you move forward:

1. **Find a Multidisciplinary Pain and Rehabilitation Center:**  
   Look for a comprehensive center in Minneapolis that specializes in complex musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain, such as the Mayo Clinic Pain Rehabilitation Center or University of Minnesota's pain management programs. These centers offer coordinated care including pain specialists, physical therapists, and psychologists.

2. **Pain Management Specialist:**  
   Seek a pain specialist who understands your history and is willing to work collaboratively without focusing solely on medication. Emphasize your goal is functional improvement, not just pain control.

3. **Physical and Occupational Therapy:**  
   Intensive, specialized therapy focusing on scapular stabilization, strengthening, and maximizing range of motion can help improve function. A therapist experienced with scapular winging and post-surgical rehabilitation is ideal.

4. **Psychological Support:**  
   Chronic pain often benefits from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other psychological support to help with coping strategies and improving quality of life.

5. **Surgical Consultation:**  
   While previous surgeons have been doubtful, consider consulting a highly specialized orthopedic or reconstructive surgeon with expertise in scapular winging and complex shoulder conditions for a second or third opinion.

6. **Support Networks:**  
   Connecting with patient support groups for chronic pain or scapular winging can provide emotional support and practical advice.

7. **Documentation and Advocacy:**  
   Keep detailed records of your treatments, surgeries, and pain management history. This can help new providers understand your case fully.

**Next Steps:**  
- Contact Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, or University of Minnesota Medical Center to inquire about multidisciplinary pain and rehabilitation services.  
- Ask your current providers for referrals to pain specialists and therapists experienced in complex shoulder conditions.  
- Consider a consultation with a reconstructive orthopedic surgeon specializing in scapular disorders.

Your goal of regaining function and quality of life is achievable with the right team and approach. Persist in seeking providers who listen and collaborate with you. If you want, I can help locate specific clinics or specialists in Minneapolis.","The most likely diagnosis is **long-standing scapular winging due to dysfunction or injury of the long thoracic nerve or serratus anterior muscle**, complicated by chronic pain syndrome.

- The patient underwent bilateral superior pole scapular excisions with reattachment of levator serratus and levator scapulae muscles, suggesting prior surgical attempts to correct scapular instability.
- Limited range of motion on the right side and chronic symptoms for 9 years indicate a chronic neuromuscular or structural problem.

   Seek a pain specialist who understands your history and is willing to work collaboratively without focusing solely on medication. Emphasize your goal is functional improvement, not just pain control.

3. **Physical and Occupational Therapy:**  
   Intensive, specialized therapy focusing on scapular stabilization, strengthening, and maximizing range of motion can help improve function. A therapist experienced with scapular winging and post-surgical rehabilitation is ideal.

4. **Psychological Support:**  
   Chronic pain often benefits from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other psychological support to help with coping strategies and improving quality of life.

5. **Surgical Consultation:**  
   While previous surgeons have been doubtful, consider consulting a highly specialized orthopedic or reconstructive surgeon with expertise in scapular winging and complex shoulder conditions for a second or third opinion.

6. **Support Networks:**  
   Connecting with patient support groups for chronic pain or scapular winging can provide emotional support and practical advice.

7. **Documentation and Advocacy:**  
   Keep detailed records of your treatments, surgeries, and pain management history. This can help new providers understand your case fully.

**Next Steps:**  
- Contact Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, or University of Minnesota Medical Center to inquire about multidisciplinary pain and rehabilitation services.  
- Ask your current providers for referrals to pain specialists and therapists experienced in complex shoulder conditions.  
- Consider a consultation with a reconstructive orthopedic surgeon specializing in scapular disorders.

Hi I just noticed that the bottom of my tongue has these big dark purple veins under it. I have had a couple of gum abscesses. 1 the tooth broke off and the abscess only comes once in a while. The second the abcess has been draining continually past couple of yrs and the tooth recently started to break. ( cant afford dental care)Yesterday a piece chipped off and is causing trauma under my tongue. Could that have something to do with the abscesses or trauma pls help,"The dark purple veins under your tongue are likely normal anatomical veins called the **sublingual veins**, which can appear more prominent in some people and are usually not a cause for concern.

Regarding your gum abscesses and broken teeth:

- **Gum abscesses** are infections that can cause pain, swelling, and drainage. A broken tooth can definitely contribute to ongoing infection and abscess formation.
- The **continuous drainage** from one abscess suggests a chronic infection that needs treatment.
- The **trauma under your tongue** from the chipped tooth can cause irritation, soreness, and possibly worsen infection risk.

**Important:** Untreated dental abscesses can lead to serious complications. Even if you cannot afford dental care, consider:

- Using warm salt water rinses to reduce bacteria.
- Keeping the area clean.
- Over-the-counter pain relievers if needed.
- Seeking low-cost or free dental clinics in your area for evaluation and treatment.

If you develop fever, severe pain, swelling spreading to your face or neck, difficulty swallowing or breathing, seek emergency care immediately.

In summary, the veins under your tongue are likely normal, but the broken tooth and abscesses need dental attention to prevent worsening infection.","The presence of prominent dark purple veins on the ventral surface of the tongue is most consistent with **varicosities (sublingual varices)**, which are common, benign vascular changes often seen in older adults.

However, given the history of chronic and intermittent gum abscesses, recent tooth breakage, and trauma under the tongue, another important consideration is a **sublingual hematoma or vascular lesion secondary to trauma or chronic inflammation**.

Key points:
- **Sublingual varices** typically appear as dark, dilated veins on the ventral tongue and are usually asymptomatic.
- Chronic abscesses and trauma can cause local inflammation, vascular congestion, or hematoma formation, which may accentuate the appearance of these veins or cause new vascular lesions.
- Continuous drainage from a chronic abscess suggests ongoing infection and inflammation, which can contribute to local vascular changes.
- Trauma from the chipped tooth fragment could cause localized bleeding or hematoma, making veins more prominent.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Sublingual varices exacerbated or made more prominent by local trauma and chronic inflammation from abscesses.**

If there is pain, swelling, or signs of infection, further evaluation and treatment of the abscesses and trauma are warranted. If the lesion is stable and asymptomatic, no treatment is usually needed for varices.

**Recommendation:**  
- Clinical examination and possibly imaging (e.g., ultrasound) to rule out hematoma or vascular malformation.  
- Management of chronic abscesses and dental issues to prevent further complications.  
- Monitor the lesion for changes in size, color, or symptoms.

"I am 31 weeks pregnant and haven t had any problems with nausea or vomiting for atleast a month now, well I just threw up and noticed it had a little bit of a pinkish tint to it and thought it might just be from some candy I ate earlier. But at the very end I threw up something dark red, I think it might be blood. But twice today I had pieces of cake and there was a little bit of dark red in the cakes. So I wonder if it could just be from that. I feel okay and the baby has moved a little since then so I feel like there s nothing wrong with her. What do you think?","Vomiting blood or seeing blood in vomit during pregnancy, especially at 31 weeks, should be taken seriously. While the pinkish tint could sometimes be from food coloring, dark red blood in vomit is concerning and may indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract or from the throat or mouth.

Even if you feel okay and the baby is moving, you should seek medical evaluation promptly to rule out any serious causes such as esophageal tears, gastritis, or other complications. Additionally, any bleeding during pregnancy warrants careful assessment.

Please contact your healthcare provider or go to the emergency room as soon as possible to get a thorough evaluation and ensure both your health and the baby's safety.","In a 31-week pregnant woman with new-onset vomiting containing pinkish to dark red material and dark red discoloration in food, the most likely diagnosis is **hematemesis (vomiting blood)**, suggesting upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Vomiting with pinkish to dark red material indicates fresh or partially digested blood.
- Dark red discoloration in food (cake) likely represents blood mixed with ingested material.
- No prior nausea/vomiting suggests this is a new event, not typical pregnancy-related hyperemesis.

I am having heavy hairfall which is not stopping at all. I am diagnosed with Hypothyroidism. And I am on medication (Thyronorm 125 mcg). Apart from that I am taking Finasteride 100mg (Finpecia) and Minoxidil topical solution. Still hairfall is there.,"Heavy hairfall in hypothyroidism patients can persist despite treatment if thyroid levels are not fully controlled or if other factors contribute. Here are some important points to consider:

1. **Thyroid Control:**  
   - Ensure your thyroid hormone levels (TSH, Free T4) are regularly monitored. Sometimes the dose of Thyronorm (levothyroxine) needs adjustment.  
   - Hairfall often improves once thyroid levels are normalized, but it can take several months.

2. **Medications:**  
   - Finasteride 100 mg is a very high dose (typical dose for hair loss is 1 mg daily). Such a high dose is usually used for other conditions and may cause side effects. Please confirm the dose with your doctor.  
   - Minoxidil topical is appropriate and can help, but results take time (3-6 months).

3. **Other Causes:**  
   - Nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D, zinc, biotin) can worsen hairfall. Get these checked.  
   - Stress, scalp infections, or other dermatological conditions may contribute.

4. **Next Steps:**  
   - Revisit your endocrinologist to review thyroid function tests and medication doses.  
   - Consult a dermatologist for scalp examination and possible additional treatments.  
   - Consider blood tests for nutritional deficiencies.

If your thyroid is well-controlled and other causes are ruled out, hairfall should gradually improve. Persistent heavy hairfall despite treatment warrants further evaluation.","In a patient with hypothyroidism on adequate Thyronorm (levothyroxine) therapy, persistent heavy hair loss despite treatment and use of Finasteride and topical Minoxidil suggests that the hair loss may not be primarily androgenetic alopecia.

The most likely diagnosis is **telogen effluvium secondary to hypothyroidism or inadequate thyroid hormone control**. Even if the patient is on Thyronorm 125 mcg, thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) should be reassessed to ensure euthyroid status, as persistent hypothyroidism or fluctuations can cause diffuse hair shedding.

Other considerations:
- **Hypothyroidism-related hair loss**: Characteristically diffuse thinning and hair shedding.
- **Telogen effluvium**: Triggered by metabolic stress, including thyroid dysfunction.
- **Non-response to Finasteride and Minoxidil**: Suggests the hair loss is not classic androgenetic alopecia.

**Recommended next steps:**
- Check thyroid function tests to confirm euthyroid status.
- Evaluate for other causes of hair loss (nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune causes).
- Consider dermatology referral for scalp biopsy if diagnosis remains unclear.

"I  am 61 years old 165 cm weight 61 kg Indian vegetarian , non smoking non drinking alchohal underwent  throat cancer surgery  Buccal Mucosa in May 2008 , taken chemotherapy + Radiation also suffering from dry mouth can i take Miraqule capsules pls adv any other medicine for dry mouth. at present no medications thanks  Hari Lulla","Hello Hari,

Given your history of throat cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, dry mouth (xerostomia) is a common side effect due to salivary gland damage.

**Regarding Miraqule capsules:**  
Miraqule (pilocarpine) is a medication that stimulates saliva production and is often prescribed for radiation-induced dry mouth. However, it should only be taken after consulting your oncologist or ENT specialist, as it may have side effects and contraindications.

**Other management options for dry mouth include:**  
- Frequent sips of water throughout the day  
- Sugar-free chewing gum or lozenges to stimulate saliva  
- Use of saliva substitutes or oral moisturizers (available over-the-counter)  
- Maintaining good oral hygiene to prevent infections  
- Avoiding caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol (which you already do)  
- Humidifying your living environment  

**Recommendation:**  
Please consult your treating oncologist or ENT specialist before starting Miraqule or any new medication. They can evaluate your current health status and advise the safest and most effective treatment for your dry mouth.

If you need, I can help you prepare questions for your doctor or suggest over-the-counter options to discuss with them.","The most likely diagnosis is **radiation-induced xerostomia (dry mouth)**.

Explanation:
- The patient has a history of throat cancer treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and **radiation therapy** to the head and neck region.
- Radiation therapy to the head and neck commonly damages salivary glands, leading to decreased saliva production and persistent dry mouth (xerostomia).
- This condition can develop months to years after treatment and is a common long-term side effect.

Regarding treatment:
- Miraqule capsules (which contain pilocarpine or similar sialogogues) may be considered to stimulate saliva production if residual salivary gland function exists.
- Other management includes good oral hygiene, saliva substitutes, frequent sips of water, and possibly other sialogogues like cevimeline.
- Consultation with a dentist or an oral medicine specialist is advisable for tailored management.

hi my pet poodle bit me or nipped me when i was giving him his medicine small bite but did break the skin (last nite)now it seems to be red and inflamed put alcohol on it and polysporin its so small feel silly going to er because its saturday and drs is closed,"Since the bite broke the skin and now appears red and inflamed, there is a risk of infection. Here are some steps you should take:

1. **Clean the wound thoroughly**: Wash the area gently with soap and warm water for several minutes.
2. **Avoid using alcohol directly on the wound repeatedly**, as it can irritate the tissue. You can continue using an antibiotic ointment like Polysporin.
3. **Monitor for signs of infection**: Increased redness, swelling, warmth, pain, pus, or fever.
4. **Seek medical attention promptly** if symptoms worsen or if you develop fever or spreading redness.

Dog bites can introduce bacteria, so it’s important to be cautious. If you have not had a tetanus shot in the last 5 years, you may need a booster. If the redness and inflammation continue to worsen, consider going to an urgent care center or ER despite it being a weekend.

If you experience severe chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, or worsening symptoms, call emergency services immediately.","The symptoms described—intermittent pain under the left rib cage with a sensation of movement, occasional chest pain, frequent gas, and recent dizziness—suggest a gastrointestinal cause, most likely **gastric or splenic flexure colic** or **gas-related discomfort**.

Key points:
- Pain under the left rib cage can be related to the stomach, spleen, or colon (splenic flexure).
- The sensation of a ""quarter moving around"" suggests gas or motility issues.
- Frequent gas supports a gastrointestinal origin.
- Occasional chest pain could be referred pain or related to esophageal/gastric irritation.
- Dizziness may be secondary to pain or vagal stimulation.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Gastrointestinal gas-related discomfort or colic, possibly involving the splenic flexure of the colon.**

However, given chest pain and dizziness, cardiac causes should be ruled out urgently. If chest pain is significant or associated with other cardiac symptoms, immediate evaluation is warranted.

**Recommendation:**

Chronic cough lasting over a year despite extensive testing and treatment can be challenging. Since you have had chest X-rays, CT scans, bronchoscopy, pulmonary evaluations, and trials of medications for reflux, allergies, and other common causes, here are some considerations:

1. **Re-evaluate diagnosis:** Sometimes less common causes like chronic cough due to upper airway cough syndrome (postnasal drip), non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, or cough hypersensitivity syndrome may be missed.

2. **Medication side effects:** Some medications, including certain blood pressure drugs (ACE inhibitors), can cause chronic cough.

3. **Neuropathic cough:** A nerve-related cough can persist despite treatment of other causes and may respond to neuromodulators.

4. **Further specialist input:** Consider evaluation by an ENT specialist for laryngeal causes or a cough specialist if available.

5. **Symptom diary:** Track triggers, timing, and associated symptoms to help identify patterns.

6. **Second opinion:** If not already done, a multidisciplinary approach involving pulmonology, ENT, gastroenterology, and allergy/immunology may help.

"I have a history of a hernia which was diagnosed 2 years ago. Today is the first day that I noticed I did not have my normal bulge which has been there for 10 years. I was admitted to the hospital yesterday after passing out following a bowel, I was discharged today from the hospital because they thought I had a cardiac issue, I have never had this type of issue before. The day before I wore a tight girdle which provided much relief from a large hernia that I was diagnosed with 2 years ago. I kept asking if by wearing the girdle I could have caused an issue with the bowel, I was told no. While I was in the hospital, I have had no appetite and I shared concerns that when I tried to eat anything today it caused discomfort in my abdomen. I also developed a headache on the left side. Since I have been home I have vomited just a little, have not urinated or had a bowl movement, I have a sharp pain on my right side and pain in my back which is also on the right side, and woke up with night sweats. Is this something to be concerned about now or can I wait till morning.","Your symptoms are concerning and suggest a possible serious complication related to your hernia or bowel, such as bowel obstruction or strangulation. Key red flags include:

- Loss of the hernia bulge (which may indicate the hernia is no longer reducible)
- Abdominal discomfort and sharp right-sided pain
- Vomiting
- No bowel movements or urination
- Night sweats
- New headache and back pain

These signs require urgent medical evaluation. You should not wait until morning. Please go to the emergency room immediately for a thorough assessment and treatment. Delaying care could lead to serious complications such as bowel ischemia or infection.","Key clinical points to consider:

- Long-standing hernia (10 years), diagnosed 2 years ago.
- Absence of usual hernia bulge today (suggesting possible reduction or complication).
- Syncope after bowel movement, initially suspected cardiac but ruled out.
- Use of a tight girdle recently, which relieved hernia symptoms.
- Anorexia, postprandial abdominal discomfort.
- Left-sided headache, slight vomiting.
- Absence of urination and bowel movements (suggesting possible obstruction or severe systemic illness).
- Sharp right-sided abdominal and back pain.
- Nocturnal diaphoresis (night sweats).

**Interpretation:**

1. **Absence of hernia bulge** in a patient with a known hernia can indicate that the hernia has become incarcerated or strangulated, or that it has spontaneously reduced but with complications.

2. **Use of a tight girdle** may have caused external compression, potentially leading to incarceration or strangulation of the hernia.

3. **Symptoms of anorexia, vomiting, absence of bowel movements and urination, and abdominal pain** strongly suggest bowel obstruction and possibly ischemia.

4. **Sharp right-sided abdominal and back pain** could indicate involvement of retroperitoneal structures or severe inflammation.

5. **Nocturnal diaphoresis and syncope** may reflect systemic inflammatory response or sepsis.

6. **Left-sided headache** is less specific but may be related to systemic illness or dehydration.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

Regarding his work I m not so sure but as I ve known he work in the sea. Medication taken only paracetamol . I m so worried about my friend.May I know what kind of illness does my friend have?","Your friend’s symptoms—fever (38-39°C) for 2 days, right-sided chest pain, mild dry cough, history of asthma, and smoking—are concerning and suggest a possible respiratory infection such as pneumonia or bronchitis. The chest pain and fever, especially with a history of asthma and smoking, warrant prompt medical evaluation to rule out pneumonia, pleuritis, or other serious conditions like a lung infection or even a pulmonary embolism.

Working at sea may expose him to different infections or environmental factors, which could contribute to his symptoms.

**Important advice:**
- Your friend should see a healthcare provider urgently for a thorough examination, chest X-ray, and possibly blood tests.
- If he develops worsening symptoms such as difficulty breathing, high fever, severe chest pain, or confusion, he should seek emergency care immediately.
- Continue paracetamol for fever and pain, but do not delay medical evaluation.

- History of asthma and smoking
- Possible occupational exposure at sea

Given the acute onset of fever, pleuritic chest pain, and cough, the most likely diagnosis is **community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**, possibly involving the right lung.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Fever and pleuritic chest pain suggest an infectious process involving the pleura or lung parenchyma.
- Cough, even if non-productive, is common in pneumonia.
- Asthma and smoking increase susceptibility to respiratory infections.

Hi Doctor.i have a baby of 2 month old.The baby is quit healthy and weights 5 Kgs.some days before i have noticed that its left foot some time Tremble automaticaly foe few seconds.the frequency has increased now.is it a serious problem. is it a neurolgical problem,"In a 2-month-old baby, occasional trembling or jitteriness in a foot can sometimes be normal, especially if the baby is awake and active. However, increasing frequency of trembling or shaking could indicate an underlying issue such as:

- Neurological problems (e.g., seizures, tremors)
- Electrolyte imbalances
- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
- Muscle or nerve irritation

Since the trembling is increasing in frequency, it is important to have your baby evaluated promptly by a pediatrician or pediatric neurologist. They may perform a physical exam and possibly recommend tests to determine the cause and ensure appropriate treatment.

If you notice any other symptoms like changes in feeding, unusual movements, stiffness, or lethargy, seek emergency care immediately.

In summary: Do not delay medical evaluation to rule out any serious neurological or metabolic issues.","In a 2-month-old infant, intermittent trembling or jerking of one limb lasting a few seconds and increasing in frequency is most likely **infantile spasms (West syndrome)** or **focal seizures**.

Key points supporting this:
- Age: 2 months is within the typical age range for infantile spasms onset (usually 3-8 months).
- Description: Brief, intermittent trembling or jerking of a limb can represent focal seizures.
- Increasing frequency suggests an epileptic process rather than benign movements.

Other considerations:
- Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus usually occurs during sleep and is not progressive.
- Normal jitteriness is usually bilateral and stops with gentle restraint.
- Tremors due to metabolic causes would likely have other systemic signs.

**Most likely diagnosis:** Focal seizures (partial seizures) in an infant, possibly evolving into infantile spasms.

**Recommendation:** Urgent neurological evaluation with EEG and neuroimaging to confirm diagnosis and initiate treatment.","Hello, From the given details, I consider the baby was born with no complications at birth and is doing well. Let me give you a slight insight into what this shaking could be, the term jitteriness refers to tremors in newborns. It is the representation of an exaggerated startle response. It is often confused for seizures (also known as convulsion and fits), which naturally unnerves the parents.

Gentle flexing (bending) of the affected limb.2.) Just holding the limb firmly and reassuringly.3.) Initiating the babies sucking action also stops the jittery movements. The tremulous movements are most frequently seen during the first few days of life in normal mature babies. It may extend throughout the neonatal period.

"A large dog bit my foot yesterday. The bite caused very minimal superficial damage to my skin, but when I touch a spot on the arch of my foot it causes a shock of pain and I have discomfort when I go up onto the ball of my foot while walking. Any ideas as to what might be wrong?","Given the history of a dog bite and your symptoms—localized shock-like pain on the arch of your foot and discomfort when pushing onto the ball of your foot—possible issues include:

1. **Nerve irritation or injury:** The bite may have caused trauma to a nerve in the foot, leading to sharp, shooting pain.
2. **Soft tissue injury:** Even if the skin damage was minimal, underlying tissues such as tendons or ligaments could be bruised or inflamed.
3. **Infection risk:** Dog bites can introduce bacteria, and early infection might cause pain and tenderness even without obvious skin damage.
4. **Tendon or plantar fascia involvement:** Pain on the arch and discomfort when pushing off could suggest involvement of the plantar fascia or tendons.

**Recommendations:**
- Monitor for signs of infection: increased redness, swelling, warmth, pus, or fever.
- Keep the area clean and consider seeing a healthcare provider promptly for evaluation.

- If pain worsens or you develop systemic symptoms, seek urgent care.

In summary, your symptoms suggest possible nerve or soft tissue injury from the bite, and evaluation by a healthcare professional is advised to prevent complications.","The most likely diagnosis is **a peripheral nerve injury, specifically involving the medial plantar nerve**.

Explanation:
- The shock-like pain on touching a specific spot suggests nerve involvement or irritation.
- The medial plantar nerve runs along the arch of the foot and provides sensation to the sole, especially the ball of the foot.
- A dog bite, even with minimal skin damage, can cause localized nerve trauma or neuritis.
- Discomfort when walking on the ball of the foot aligns with medial plantar nerve dysfunction.

Treatment typically involves pain management and monitoring for infection.","Given the history of a dog bite and your symptoms—localized shock-like pain on the arch of your foot and discomfort when pushing onto the ball of your foot—possible issues include:

1. **Nerve irritation or injury:** The bite may have caused trauma to a nerve in the foot, leading to sharp, shooting pain.
2. **Soft tissue injury:** Even if the skin damage was minimal, underlying tissues such as tendons or ligaments could be bruised or inflamed.
3. **Infection risk:** Dog bites can introduce bacteria, and early infection might cause pain and tenderness even without obvious skin damage.
4. **Tendon or plantar fascia involvement:** Pain on the arch and discomfort when pushing off could suggest involvement of the plantar fascia or tendons.

**Recommendations:**
- Monitor for signs of infection: increased redness, swelling, warmth, pus, or fever.
- Keep the area clean and consider seeing a healthcare provider promptly for evaluation.
- They may assess for nerve injury, soft tissue damage, and decide if antibiotics or imaging are needed.

"I have pain on my lower right side of my abdomen I think above my appendix it has been coming and going for about a week now. sometimes it is sharp pain and I get really bad cramps with it, other times its just a sharp pain that comes and then goes away. it does it a couple times in a row tho. I have had a cist their before, 4 years ago it is no longer their it think. I did just have a baby 8 months ago, but when I went to the doctor everything checked out fine. Cancer also does run in my family. What do you think it could be? it doesnt feel like its a cist that I had before.","Your symptoms of intermittent sharp pain and cramps in the lower right abdomen could be due to several possible causes, including:

1. **Ovarian issues**: Even if your previous cyst resolved, new cysts or ovarian conditions (like ovulation pain or mild ovarian torsion) can cause similar pain.
2. **Muscle strain**: Post-pregnancy abdominal muscles can sometimes cause pain, especially with activity.
3. **Gastrointestinal causes**: Conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, or mild infections can cause cramping and sharp pain.
4. **Appendix-related issues**: Although classic appendicitis usually causes constant pain, sometimes early or mild inflammation can cause intermittent pain.
5. **Other gynecological causes**: Endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease can cause intermittent lower abdominal pain.

Given your family history of cancer and recent childbirth, it is important to have a thorough evaluation. Since your doctor previously checked you and found no immediate issues, but the pain persists and is sharp and recurrent, I recommend:

- Follow-up with your healthcare provider for a detailed physical exam.
- Possibly imaging studies like an ultrasound or CT scan to evaluate ovaries, appendix, and other abdominal organs.
- Blood tests to check for infection or inflammation.

If you develop worsening pain, fever, vomiting, or other concerning symptoms, seek urgent medical care.

In summary, while it may not be your old cyst, the pain warrants further evaluation to rule out gynecological, gastrointestinal, or other causes. Please consult your healthcare provider promptly for a detailed assessment.","The patient's presentation of intermittent sharp pain and severe cramps in the lower right abdomen, above the appendix area, recurring over a week, suggests a few possibilities.

- The pain is intermittent and episodic, not constant or progressively worsening.
- The previous cyst resolved and is considered unrelated by the patient.
- The patient is postpartum (8 months after delivery).
- Family history of cancer is noted but no current alarming systemic symptoms mentioned.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

**Right ovarian cyst or functional ovarian cyst (e.g., hemorrhagic or ruptured cyst)**

Rationale:
- Ovarian cysts can cause intermittent sharp pain and cramping, especially if they undergo torsion, rupture, or hemorrhage.
- The location above the appendix corresponds to the right adnexal region.
- Postpartum hormonal changes can influence ovarian cyst formation.
- The previous cyst history increases the likelihood of recurrent cysts.
- The pain pattern (intermittent, sharp, cramping) fits cyst-related pain better than appendicitis, which usually presents with constant, worsening pain and systemic signs.
- Other causes like appendicitis, hernia, or gastrointestinal issues are less likely given the intermittent nature and lack of systemic symptoms.

**Next steps:**
- Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for ovarian cysts or other adnexal pathology.
- Clinical examination to rule out tenderness, masses, or signs of acute abdomen.
- Consider gynecological consultation.

"1. Hello. I am a male, 56, stay in Mumbai. I developed epilepsy at the age of 18 (predicted by my Doc when I was 16, and kept me on ACDs). I am an asthamatic too (not very serious) and am allergic to certain types of dust. I smoke but dont drink now. Since 1982, I have been taking Carbamazepine 400 & Phenytoin 100 once in the morning. The seizures became rare after that. In 2011 (April), I had a major seizure (after 16 years) that lasted for 2 -3 minutes. Everything seems to be fine so long as I am sitting home doing nothing. The moment I stress my brain by I begin to get the shocks jerks ....whatever you call them. Things like- say, involving in a complex Math problem, arranging the book shelf, working on a machine design or doing multitasking (like going to the grocers with a list of more than 8-10 items which I have to search for in that shop), or cooking without the printed recipe at hand and without the ingredients arranged properly in advance .....etc.","Based on your history and current symptoms, here is a summary and possible considerations:

1. **Epilepsy History:**  
- Diagnosed in late teens, on long-term antiepileptic drugs (Carbamazepine 400 mg + Phenytoin 100 mg daily).  
- Seizures well controlled for many years, with a major breakthrough seizure in 2011 after 16 years seizure-free.  
- Current symptoms triggered by cognitive stress or multitasking, causing jerks or ""shocks,"" which may represent focal seizures or myoclonic jerks.

2. **Possible Causes of Current Symptoms:**  
- **Breakthrough seizures or partial seizures:** Cognitive stress can precipitate seizures in some patients with epilepsy.  
- **Medication levels:** Long-term use of Carbamazepine and Phenytoin requires monitoring of blood levels to ensure therapeutic range and avoid toxicity or subtherapeutic dosing.  
- **Cognitive or neurological changes:** Aging, medication side effects, or subtle brain changes could contribute to increased seizure susceptibility or abnormal movements.  
- **Other causes:** Stress, sleep deprivation, or metabolic disturbances can also trigger seizures.

3. **Recommendations:**  
- **Neurological evaluation:** See a neurologist for a detailed assessment.  
- **EEG and MRI brain:** To check for any new epileptiform activity or structural changes.  
- **Blood tests:** Check antiepileptic drug levels, liver and kidney function, electrolytes.  
- **Medication review:** Your regimen may need adjustment or addition of newer antiepileptic drugs with better side effect profiles.  
- **Lifestyle:** Avoid known seizure triggers, ensure good sleep, manage stress, and avoid smoking if possible.  
- **Safety:** Avoid activities that could be dangerous if a seizure occurs (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery) until stable.

Your symptoms suggest that your epilepsy may be less well controlled under cognitive stress, and a thorough re-evaluation is warranted to optimize treatment and prevent further seizures. Please consult your neurologist promptly.","The patient's history and presentation suggest **reflex epilepsy triggered by cognitive (mental) tasks**, specifically a form of **cognitive or praxis-induced reflex seizures**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Long-standing epilepsy with good control for many years.
- Seizures are now consistently triggered by specific cognitive stressors or complex mental tasks (e.g., complex math, organizing, multitasking).
- Seizure-like jerks and shocks during these tasks indicate motor manifestations typical of reflex seizures.
- The nature of triggers (higher cortical functions) aligns with praxis-induced seizures, a subtype of reflex epilepsy.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

- **Mucus discharge from the rectum**, which can occur with irritation or inflammation of the bowel (e.g., colitis, irritable bowel syndrome).
- **Infection or inflammation** in the intestines.
- **Anal or rectal issues** like fissures or hemorrhoids.
- Less commonly, more serious conditions like inflammatory bowel disease.

"Hii.... am of 17 yrs old my height is 55 & weight is aproximately 58. I have severe stomach pain & vomiting sensation from last 10-12 days.. Am quite worried about dis coz no medicine is working on me.. I have under gone urine & LFT tests but d reports are normal, it only shows that i have pus cells in urine.....Can u plz help me out...??","Hello! I'm sorry to hear about your symptoms. Severe stomach pain and vomiting lasting 10-12 days is concerning and needs prompt medical evaluation. The presence of pus cells in urine suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), which can sometimes cause abdominal pain and vomiting.

However, since your pain is severe and persistent, and initial tests (urine and liver function tests) are normal except for pus cells, you should see a doctor urgently for a thorough examination. Additional tests like abdominal ultrasound, blood tests, or imaging may be needed to identify the cause.

Please seek medical attention immediately, especially if you have fever, worsening pain, inability to keep fluids down, or signs of dehydration. Do not delay, as some causes of severe abdominal pain require urgent treatment.","Key points from the case:
- Age: 17 years
- Height: 55 inches (~140 cm, which is quite short for age)
- Weight: 58 kg (which is relatively high for that height, indicating possible overweight)
- Symptoms: Severe abdominal pain and nausea for 10-12 days
- Urine analysis: Presence of pus cells (pyuria)
- Liver function tests: Normal
- No relief with medications

Interpretation:
- Presence of pus cells in urine suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis.
- Severe abdominal pain and nausea can be consistent with a urinary tract infection involving the kidneys.
- Normal liver function tests rule out hepatic causes.
- Duration of symptoms (10-12 days) and no response to medications suggest a complicated or untreated infection.

Most likely diagnosis:
**Acute pyelonephritis (kidney infection)**

This diagnosis fits the clinical picture of abdominal/flank pain, nausea, pyuria, and prolonged symptoms without improvement.

Recommendation:
- Further evaluation with urine culture and sensitivity
- Imaging (renal ultrasound) to rule out obstruction or abscess
- Initiation of appropriate antibiotics based on culture results

If symptoms worsen or fever develops, urgent medical attention is needed.","Hi, Thanks for writing your query. After reading your post, it seems that you might be having Urinary Tract Infection(UTI). I would advise that you should get culture and sensitivity test of your urine sample. It will help in knowing the causative organism and the appropriate antibiotic for it.

Urine analysis shows presence of pus cells, while liver function tests are normal. The patient reports that no medications have alleviated symptoms. What is the most likely diagnosis?",model_response_conv,model_response_og,doctor_output,"Key points from the case:
- Age: 17 years
- Height: 55 inches (~140 cm, which is quite short for age)
- Weight: 58 kg (which is relatively high for that height, indicating possible overweight)
- Symptoms: Severe abdominal pain and nausea for 10-12 days
- Urine analysis: Presence of pus cells (pyuria)
- Liver function tests: Normal
- No relief with medications

Interpretation:
- Presence of pus cells in urine suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis.
- Severe abdominal pain and nausea can be consistent with a urinary tract infection involving the kidneys.
- Normal liver function tests rule out hepatic causes.
- Duration of symptoms (10-12 days) and no response to medications suggest a complicated or untreated infection.

Most likely diagnosis:
**Acute pyelonephritis (kidney infection)**

This diagnosis fits the clinical picture of abdominal/flank pain, nausea, pyuria, and prolonged symptoms without improvement.

Recommendation:
- Further evaluation with urine culture and sensitivity
- Imaging (renal ultrasound) to rule out obstruction or abscess
- Initiation of appropriate antibiotics based on culture results

If symptoms worsen or fever develops, urgent medical attention is needed.","Hello! I'm sorry to hear about your symptoms. Severe stomach pain and vomiting lasting 10-12 days is concerning and needs prompt medical evaluation. The presence of pus cells in urine suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), which can sometimes cause abdominal pain and vomiting.

However, since your pain is severe and persistent, and initial tests (urine and liver function tests) are normal except for pus cells, you should see a doctor urgently for a thorough examination. Additional tests like abdominal ultrasound, blood tests, or imaging may be needed to identify the cause.

Please seek medical attention immediately, especially if you have fever, worsening pain, inability to keep fluids down, or signs of dehydration. Do not delay, as some causes of severe abdominal pain require urgent treatment.","Hi, Thanks for writing your query. After reading your post, it seems that you might be having Urinary Tract Infection(UTI). I would advise that you should get culture and sensitivity test of your urine sample.

"I ve been taking 10 milligram acetaminophen / hydrocodone for about a year for lower back pain. I have just begun to have all over joint pain/ muscle pain and am feeling sick and weak like I have the flu but no fever, I am also noticing weakness in my legs and pain from my shoulders down to my hands. Could this be a side effect of the medication.","Your symptoms of widespread joint and muscle pain, weakness, and flu-like feelings could potentially be related to long-term use of acetaminophen/hydrocodone, but they are not typical side effects. Hydrocodone can cause muscle weakness or flu-like symptoms in some cases, but new or worsening muscle weakness and joint pain warrant prompt medical evaluation.

These symptoms could indicate other serious conditions such as:

- Medication-induced muscle damage (e.g., opioid myopathy)
- Neurological issues (e.g., neuropathy or myelopathy)
- An inflammatory or autoimmune condition
- Infection or other systemic illness

Given the leg weakness and spreading pain, you should seek medical attention promptly to rule out serious causes and to review your medication regimen. Do not stop your medication abruptly without consulting your healthcare provider.","The patient's symptoms of widespread joint and muscle pain, generalized weakness, malaise, and pain extending from shoulders to hands, developing after long-term use of acetaminophen/hydrocodone, suggest a possible diagnosis of **opioid-induced myopathy or an inflammatory myopathy**.

However, acetaminophen/hydrocodone is not commonly associated with direct muscle inflammation or widespread joint pain as a side effect. Instead, these symptoms are more consistent with an **inflammatory or autoimmune myopathy** (e.g., polymyositis or dermatomyositis) or a drug-induced myopathy from other medications (e.g., statins), or a systemic condition.

Given the flu-like symptoms without fever, muscle weakness, and pain distribution, **inflammatory myopathy** is the most likely diagnosis.

**Important considerations:**
- Hydrocodone rarely causes myopathy.
- Acetaminophen is not known to cause these symptoms.
- Other causes such as viral myositis, autoimmune diseases, or paraneoplastic syndromes should be considered.
- A thorough workup including muscle enzymes (CK), inflammatory markers, autoimmune panel, and possibly muscle biopsy may be needed.

- Peripheral vascular issues (poor blood flow)
- Nerve problems (such as peripheral neuropathy)
- Hypothyroidism
- Raynaud's phenomenon
- Other systemic conditions

"My husband is having a dull tightness in his right abdomen. He describes it as a feeling of being full after eating small meals and a feeling that his stomach is balled up in one area. He has been very gassy and sometimes a pain or an uncomfortable feeling is there and stays there for a while until he lays down. He states that when he lifts his arms up there is a feeling like it is being pulled because of how tight it is. He has had blood work, stool samples, x-rays, liver enzyme test, pretty much everything except for a CT or MRI and everything has came back normal but he is still having the same feeling. We do not have a clue as to what else could be causing this.","Your husband's symptoms of dull tightness in the right abdomen, early satiety (feeling full after small meals), localized discomfort, increased gas, and a sensation of tightness that improves with lying down, despite normal blood work, stool tests, x-rays, and liver enzymes, suggest a few possible causes:

1. **Musculoskeletal issues**: The sensation of tightness when lifting arms and feeling like something is being pulled could indicate muscle strain, costochondritis, or nerve irritation in the abdominal wall or chest area.

2. **Functional gastrointestinal disorders**: Conditions like functional dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can cause bloating, gas, and discomfort without abnormal test results.

3. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or motility disorders**: These can cause upper abdominal discomfort and fullness.

4. **Hernia or abdominal wall abnormalities**: Sometimes small hernias or muscle defects are not visible on basic imaging.

5. **Less common causes**: Such as early gallbladder disease, biliary dyskinesia, or intermittent partial bowel obstruction.

Given the persistence of symptoms and normal initial workup, the next steps could include:

- **Abdominal CT or MRI**: To evaluate soft tissues, organs, and rule out subtle structural causes.
- **Referral to a gastroenterologist**: For further evaluation, possibly including upper endoscopy or motility studies.
- **Assessment by a physical therapist or pain specialist**: If musculoskeletal causes are suspected.

If symptoms worsen, new symptoms develop (fever, weight loss, severe pain), or if there is any concern for serious conditions, seek urgent medical evaluation.

Encourage your husband to keep a symptom diary noting food intake, activities, and symptom patterns to help guide further evaluation.","The patient's symptoms—dull tightness and fullness in the right abdomen after small meals, localized abdominal constriction, increased flatulence, intermittent pain improving on lying down, and a pulling sensation with arm movement—along with normal blood work, stool tests, abdominal x-rays, and liver enzymes, suggest a functional rather than structural or inflammatory cause.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Functional abdominal wall pain syndrome (abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome, ACNES)** or a related abdominal wall myofascial pain syndrome.

**Rationale:**  
- The sensation of tightness and pulling with arm movement suggests involvement of the abdominal wall muscles or nerves rather than intra-abdominal organs.  
- Normal imaging and labs exclude common intra-abdominal pathologies (e.g., liver, bowel, gallbladder).  
- Symptoms improving on lying down and worsening with movement are typical of abdominal wall pain.  
- Increased flatulence and fullness may be functional or related to altered abdominal wall mechanics.

If needed, a Carnett’s test (increased pain on tensing abdominal muscles) can help confirm abdominal wall origin.

I had an open fracture to my elbow 3weeks ago they put in surgery an irrigated it and closed it up however the did not fix anything else it was dislocated as well as radial and fracture to my humorous is it too late now if I need more surgery or pins I also broke my wrist,"Given your open elbow fracture with dislocation, radial and humerus fractures, and a wrist fracture, it is important to have a thorough orthopedic evaluation as soon as possible. 

Even though 3 weeks have passed since surgery, it may not be too late for additional surgery or fixation (pins, plates) if your bones are not healing properly, are unstable, or if there is persistent pain or dysfunction. Delayed treatment can increase the risk of complications like malunion, nonunion, stiffness, or nerve damage.

I strongly recommend you see an orthopedic surgeon promptly for:
- Clinical examination
- Imaging (X-rays, possibly CT)
- Assessment of bone healing and joint stability

They can determine if further surgery or hardware is needed to optimize healing and function. Do not delay evaluation, as timely intervention improves outcomes. If you have increasing pain, swelling, fever, or signs of infection, seek emergency care immediately.","The most likely diagnosis is a **complex open elbow fracture-dislocation with associated radial head fracture and humeral fracture**, complicated by a wrist fracture. This injury pattern suggests a high-energy trauma causing multi-level fractures and joint instability.

Key points:
- Open elbow fracture with dislocation indicates significant soft tissue and bone injury.
- Radial involvement (likely radial head or neck fracture) affects elbow stability and forearm rotation.
- Humeral fracture adds complexity to the injury.
- Wrist fracture suggests additional trauma to the forearm or hand.
- Initial surgical irrigation and closure without fixation may have been done to manage infection risk and soft tissue condition.

Regarding timing and necessity of additional surgery or pin fixation:
- Definitive fixation is usually required once soft tissue conditions allow, typically within days to a few weeks after injury.
- Delayed fixation beyond 3 weeks can be more challenging but may still be necessary to restore joint stability, alignment, and function.
- Pin fixation or internal fixation is often needed to stabilize fractures and allow early mobilization.
- Close orthopedic follow-up is essential to plan staged surgical intervention based on healing, infection risk, and soft tissue status.

No problems swallowing, no pain, except for a muscle pulled feel around my shoulder blades on occassion.","Feeling a lump or fullness at the base of the throat when running your hand down the front is not typically normal and could indicate several possibilities, such as:

- A thyroid nodule or enlargement (goiter)
- Enlarged lymph nodes
- A structural issue like a cervical spine problem
- Esophageal or tracheal abnormalities

Since you have no pain or swallowing difficulties, urgent causes are less likely, but the sensation should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. The occasional muscle pain around your shoulder blades may be unrelated but worth mentioning.

**Recommendation:**  
See your primary care provider or an ENT specialist for a physical exam. They may order imaging (like an ultrasound of the neck) to assess the thyroid and surrounding structures. Early evaluation helps rule out any significant issues and provides peace of mind. If you develop new symptoms like difficulty swallowing, voice changes, pain, or rapid growth of the lump, seek care promptly.","The sensation of a lump in the throat without pain or dysphagia, often described as a feeling of something pushing outward, is characteristic of **globus sensation (globus pharyngeus)**.

- Sensation of a lump without actual obstruction
- No pain or difficulty swallowing
- Normal physical exam and history

"i recently started playing girls water polo at school and yesterday whale i was showering and cleaning my body i found a bump on my butt and when i touched it, it hurt. and today at school when i would sit it would hurt i have no idea what this is or what it can be i have never had anything like this before","A painful bump on the buttock that hurts when touched and when sitting could be due to several possible causes, including:

1. **Pilonidal cyst** – a cyst or abscess near the tailbone that can become painful and swollen.
2. **Boil (furuncle)** – a painful, pus-filled bump caused by a bacterial infection of a hair follicle.
3. **Insect bite or irritation** – causing localized swelling and pain.
4. **Trauma or friction injury** – from physical activity like water polo, causing a tender lump or bruise.

Since it is painful and affecting sitting, it’s important to have it evaluated by a healthcare provider. They can examine the bump, possibly drain it if needed, and recommend treatment such as antibiotics or warm compresses.

If you develop fever, increasing redness, swelling, or severe pain, seek medical care promptly. Meanwhile, avoid pressure on the area and keep it clean.","The most likely diagnosis is a **pilonidal cyst (or pilonidal abscess)**.

**Reasoning:**
- Location: Buttock area, typically near the sacrococcygeal region.
- Presentation: Painful, tender bump that causes discomfort when sitting.
- Recent activity: Water polo involves repetitive sitting and friction in the buttock area, which can predispose to pilonidal cyst formation or infection.
- No prior history: Pilonidal cysts often present suddenly with pain and swelling.

**Recommendation:** Evaluation by a healthcare provider for confirmation and management, which may include incision and drainage if abscessed.","Hello! Thank you for the query. If this lump is in the butt cheek area, infected colonial cyst is the most probable reason. If the lump is somewhere else on the butt, skin infection and small abscess it is. In both cases you need to have it incised and Chat Doctor.  Otherwise, it will get more painful. In case of colonial cyst you need to have it removed when the acute inflammation will be gone. Please consult general surgeon with this issue. Hope this will help. Regards.",A patient who recently started playing girls' water polo noticed a painful bump on the buttock while showering. The bump was tender to touch and caused pain when sitting the following day. The patient has no previous history of similar lesions. What is the most likely diagnosis?,model_response_conv,model_response_og,doctor_output,"The most likely diagnosis is a **pilonidal cyst (or pilonidal abscess)**.

**Reasoning:**
- Location: Buttock area, typically near the sacrococcygeal region.
- Presentation: Painful, tender bump that causes discomfort when sitting.
- Recent activity: Water polo involves repetitive sitting and friction in the buttock area, which can predispose to pilonidal cyst formation or infection.
- No prior history: Pilonidal cysts often present suddenly with pain and swelling.

Other possibilities like an infected sebaceous cyst or abscess are possible but pilonidal cyst is most common in this scenario.

**Recommendation:** Evaluation by a healthcare provider for confirmation and management, which may include incision and drainage if abscessed.","A painful bump on the buttock that hurts when touched and when sitting could be due to several possible causes, including:

1. **Pilonidal cyst** – a cyst or abscess near the tailbone that can become painful and swollen.
2. **Boil (furuncle)** – a painful, pus-filled bump caused by a bacterial infection of a hair follicle.
3. **Insect bite or irritation** – causing localized swelling and pain.
4. **Trauma or friction injury** – from physical activity like water polo, causing a tender lump or bruise.

Since it is painful and affecting sitting, it’s important to have it evaluated by a healthcare provider. They can examine the bump, possibly drain it if needed, and recommend treatment such as antibiotics or warm compresses.

If you develop fever, increasing redness, swelling, or severe pain, seek medical care promptly. Meanwhile, avoid pressure on the area and keep it clean.","Hello! Thank you for the query.

"Hello. Im 15 and havent had intercourse but me and my boyfriend were touching each other. After he got hard, he went to the loo then came back (I do not know if he ejaculated or not) and we started to pleasure each other again. I dont think at any point his penis touched my vagina BUT is there a chance I could still get pregnant? (i.e if there was sperm on mine or his hands?) Thank you.","Hello! Since you did not have vaginal intercourse and his penis did not touch your vagina, the chance of pregnancy is very low. However, pregnancy can occur if sperm comes into direct contact with the vaginal area. If there was any ejaculation on his hands and then those hands touched your vagina, there is a small possibility, but it's generally quite unlikely.

If you're concerned, you might consider emergency contraception, which is most effective when taken soon after potential exposure. For future peace of mind, using contraception methods and being cautious about contact with sperm near the vaginal area can help prevent pregnancy.

If you have more questions or concerns, talking to a healthcare provider can give you personalized advice.","In this scenario, the most likely conclusion is that pregnancy is highly unlikely.

Key points:
- No direct penile-vaginal intercourse occurred.
- The patient engaged in genital touching, but no confirmed ejaculation on or near the vaginal area.
- Sperm on hands is generally not sufficient to cause pregnancy because sperm quickly lose viability outside the body and require direct deposition into the vagina.

**Diagnosis/Assessment:**  
No pregnancy risk from sperm on hands during genital touching without direct vaginal penetration or ejaculation near the vaginal opening.

**Counseling:**  
Reassure the patient that pregnancy from this scenario is extremely unlikely. If concerned, a pregnancy test can be done after a missed period for confirmation. Discuss safe sexual practices and contraception for future prevention.","Hi, if there was no contact of semen with your vagina, there is no chanc3 of pregnancy.  Even if you have the slightest doubt about it, pregnancy can happen. So, better to take emergency pill.  If you have delayed the periods, do a urine pregnancy test.

hello doctor iam from india..............my aunt is diagnosed of gallbladder cancer. we took her to very renowned hospital in india.....where doctors told us .......nothing can be done .............cancer has spreaded all over the liver .........we are going throgh trauma.......... i want to know is anty thing possible ......can we stop her death .....please help us.,"I'm very sorry to hear about your aunt's diagnosis. Gallbladder cancer that has spread extensively to the liver is often advanced and challenging to treat. In such cases, curative surgery is usually not possible.

However, there are some options that might help improve quality of life and possibly extend survival, such as:

- **Palliative chemotherapy:** To slow cancer growth and relieve symptoms.
- **Targeted therapy or immunotherapy:** Depending on specific tumor markers, though these are less common.
- **Palliative care:** Focuses on symptom management, pain relief, and emotional support.

It's important to discuss with her oncologist about possible clinical trials or newer treatments available.

While it may not be possible to cure the disease at this stage, supportive care can help maintain comfort and dignity. Please consider consulting a palliative care specialist for comprehensive support.

If you want, I can provide more detailed information or guidance on symptom management.","The most likely diagnosis is **advanced metastatic gallbladder cancer with extensive liver involvement**.

Explanation:
- The primary cancer is gallbladder cancer.
- The cancer has extensively spread (metastasized) throughout the liver.
- This extensive hepatic metastasis indicates advanced-stage disease.
- The prognosis is poor, and often no curative treatment options remain at this stage.
- The hospital's conclusion that no further treatment options are available aligns with the diagnosis of terminal metastatic gallbladder cancer.

"Hello Doctor. Im 25. I have been feeling weak and i feel i have no energy to do anything. I had chest pain and i felt i could not fill myself up enough with oxygen. My throat feels blocked the whole time. I did gastroscopy and they diagnosed me with Gerd( acid reflux) cos my stomach doesnt close properly. Im since 2 years on nexium and lansoprazol. Still feeling pain in the chest and i have a bit of breathing problems. I went to specialist, xray and all breathing tests came back normal. I know these symptoms feel like i have anxiety problems or i might sound depressed but i feel past 4-5 months my body changed and something doesnt feel right. My doctor did all blood tests and are all normal except my kolesterol is a bit high . I dont know what to do else. Can you give me an idea of what it might be please? Thank you","Thank you for sharing your detailed symptoms. Given your history of GERD treated with Nexium and Lansoprazole, persistent chest pain, breathlessness, and throat discomfort despite normal lung tests and blood work, here are some considerations:

1. **GERD-related complications:** Even with treatment, acid reflux can cause esophageal spasms, esophagitis, or laryngeal irritation, leading to chest pain and throat symptoms. Sometimes symptoms persist due to incomplete acid suppression or non-acid reflux.

2. **Functional or motility disorders:** Conditions like esophageal motility disorders (e.g., achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm) can cause chest pain and a sensation of throat blockage. These may require specialized tests like esophageal manometry.

3. **Cardiac causes:** Although less likely at your age and with normal tests, sometimes atypical angina can present with chest discomfort and breathlessness. A cardiology evaluation might be considered if symptoms persist.

4. **Anxiety or somatic symptoms:** Anxiety can cause chest tightness, breathlessness, and fatigue. However, you mentioned your symptoms feel different from anxiety, so this should be considered but not assumed.

5. **Other causes:** Rarely, conditions like anemia, thyroid dysfunction, or other systemic illnesses can cause fatigue and chest symptoms, but your blood tests were normal.

**Recommendations:**

- Discuss with your gastroenterologist about further evaluation of your esophagus, possibly including esophageal manometry or pH impedance testing to assess acid and non-acid reflux.
- Consider a cardiology consult if chest pain persists or worsens.
- Continue monitoring your cholesterol and consider lifestyle changes or treatment as advised.
- If anxiety or depression is suspected, a mental health evaluation may help, but only as part of a comprehensive approach.

If symptoms worsen (severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, fainting), seek emergency care immediately.

Please follow up closely with your healthcare providers for tailored evaluation and management.","The patient's symptoms—weakness, lack of energy, chest pain, sensation of insufficient oxygen, and persistent throat blockage—along with a history of GERD treated with PPIs (Nexium, Lansoprazole) but persistent chest pain and mild breathing difficulties, and normal cardiac and pulmonary workup, suggest a functional or non-cardiopulmonary cause.

Key points:
- GERD history with incomplete symptom resolution despite PPI therapy.
- Normal chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests.
- Normal blood tests except mild hypercholesterolemia.
- Symptoms include chest pain and throat sensation (""globus sensation"").
- Concern about anxiety/depression but physical symptoms have changed recently.

Most likely diagnosis: **Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) or extraesophageal reflux disease**.

Explanation:
- LPR is a variant of GERD where reflux reaches the larynx and pharynx, causing throat symptoms (globus sensation, throat blockage), chest discomfort, and respiratory symptoms.
- LPR often does not respond fully to standard GERD treatment and may require different management.
- Normal pulmonary and cardiac tests exclude primary lung or heart disease.
- Anxiety/depression can coexist but do not fully explain the physical symptom progression.
- Persistent chest pain with normal cardiac workup and GERD history points to reflux-related esophageal or laryngopharyngeal irritation.

Recommendation:
- Consider ENT evaluation with laryngoscopy to assess for LPR.
- Trial of lifestyle modifications and possibly different reflux management (e.g., alginates, dietary changes).
- Evaluate and manage any anxiety/depression as adjunct.

If symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation for esophageal motility disorders or other causes may be needed.

**Summary:** The most likely diagnosis is **laryngopharyngeal reflux (extraesophageal reflux disease)** causing persistent throat and chest symptoms despite standard GERD treatment.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor.

"I had a dream that i had pain in my heart and that too twice. The pain was too strong in dream itself, it was more like stretch in muscles nd as if my heart were split into two pieces. When i woke i could still feel the lil pain on heart side. And one thing i forgot to tell that there has been a constant pain in my left arm from shoulder to Fingers for like 2-3 years and i always ignored that. Now i am feeling worried that it can be related to some heart problem. I can t stop thinking about that dream, what could it be? I still don t know if I felt the pain in real or it was just a bad dream.. btw i am 22 years old","Your symptoms—heart pain in a dream with lingering mild pain on the left side of the chest and a long-standing pain in the left arm—warrant careful evaluation. While dreams can cause vivid sensations, persistent pain in the left arm and chest should not be ignored, as they can sometimes indicate heart or nerve issues.

Given your age (22 years), serious heart problems are less common but not impossible. The arm pain lasting 2-3 years may be related to nerve, muscle, or orthopedic issues rather than the heart, but it still needs assessment.

**What you should do:**
- Seek prompt medical evaluation to rule out cardiac causes, especially if you have risk factors (family history, smoking, high blood pressure).
- A doctor will likely perform a physical exam, ECG (electrocardiogram), and possibly blood tests.
- If cardiac causes are ruled out, further evaluation for nerve or musculoskeletal causes of arm pain may be needed.

**In summary:** Do not ignore these symptoms. Visit a healthcare provider soon to get a proper diagnosis and peace of mind. If you experience severe chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness, seek emergency care immediately.","The patient's symptoms include:

- A vivid dream involving intense heart pain described as stretching and splitting.
- Mild residual left-sided chest pain upon waking.
- A chronic, constant pain in the left arm (shoulder to fingers) lasting 2-3 years.

Key points to consider:

1. **Dream-related chest pain**: Pain experienced during a dream is unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac event. Cardiac ischemia or infarction typically causes real-time pain, not dream-induced pain.

2. **Mild residual chest pain on waking**: This could be musculoskeletal or related to anxiety or other non-cardiac causes.

3. **Chronic left arm pain for years**: Constant arm pain over years is unlikely to be cardiac in origin, as cardiac pain (angina) is typically episodic and exertional. Chronic arm pain suggests musculoskeletal, neuropathic (e.g., cervical radiculopathy), or peripheral nerve issues.

4. **Age and risk factors**: At 22 years old, unless there are significant risk factors (family history, congenital heart disease, drug use), cardiac ischemia is less likely.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

- The chronic left arm pain is likely due to a **neuropathic or musculoskeletal cause**, such as cervical radiculopathy or nerve entrapment.
- The chest pain on waking and dream-related pain are likely **non-cardiac**, possibly musculoskeletal or anxiety-related.

**Recommendation:**

- A thorough physical and neurological examination focusing on the cervical spine and upper limb.
- Consider imaging (e.g., cervical spine MRI) and nerve conduction studies if neuropathy is suspected.
- Cardiac evaluation (ECG, echocardiogram) can be done to rule out cardiac causes if clinically indicated, but the presentation is not typical for cardiac ischemia.

"I have a painful lump above my collarbone near my neck, it hurts when i touch it or move my neck and inside there is a little hard knot. The swelling has been reducing day by day, but I am concerned about what this is? There are no signs of redness or bruising I did get a flu shot and the TDAP shot","A painful lump above the collarbone near the neck with a hard knot that is gradually reducing in size and without redness or bruising is most likely an inflamed or swollen lymph node. This can occur as a reaction to recent vaccinations (like flu or TDAP shots) or a mild infection.

Key points:
- Pain and tenderness suggest inflammation.
- Gradual reduction is a good sign of healing.
- No redness or bruising reduces concern for infection or trauma.

However, if the lump:
- Grows again or does not continue to shrink,
- Becomes very hard, fixed, or larger than 2-3 cm,
- Is associated with systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, weight loss,
- Or if pain worsens significantly,

you should see a healthcare provider for further evaluation.

For now, you can monitor it, avoid heavy neck movements that cause pain, and use warm compresses if comfortable. If symptoms worsen or persist beyond 2-3 weeks, seek medical attention.","The most likely diagnosis is **reactive lymphadenopathy** (inflamed lymph node) secondary to recent vaccination.

**Rationale:**
- Location: A painful lump above the collarbone near the neck corresponds to a supraclavicular or deep cervical lymph node.
- Characteristics: Small, hard, tender, and painful with neck movement suggests lymph node inflammation.
- Progression: Swelling decreasing over days indicates a resolving inflammatory process.
- No redness or bruising: Less likely to be an abscess or traumatic hematoma.
- Recent flu and Tdap vaccinations: These can cause localized immune activation and transient lymphadenopathy.

"My mother has had dentures for about 11 years, she is 80 years old. She has always told me that they hurt. especially her upper plate. She has been to several dentists that have told her that her bone structure isn t great, and that is why it hurts, so she leaves them out all of the tim,. therefore she never goes out of the house. Please help!!!!","I'm sorry to hear about your mother's discomfort. Chronic denture pain, especially after many years, often results from bone resorption (loss of jawbone) under the denture, causing poor fit and sore spots. Here are some important steps to consider:

1. **Professional Evaluation:** She should see a prosthodontist (a specialist in dentures) for a thorough assessment. They can evaluate the fit, check for sore spots, and assess bone condition.

2. **Denture Adjustment or Relining:** Sometimes, relining or adjusting the denture can improve comfort by better adapting to the current shape of the gums and bone.

3. **New Dentures:** After 10+ years, dentures often need replacement due to changes in the mouth. New dentures made with modern techniques may fit better and be more comfortable.

4. **Implant-Supported Dentures:** If bone loss is significant but she is medically fit, dental implants can stabilize dentures, greatly improving comfort and function.

5. **Oral Health Check:** Ensure there are no infections, ulcers, or other oral conditions contributing to pain.

Encourage her to seek a specialist's opinion. Leaving dentures out constantly can affect nutrition and quality of life. Properly fitting dentures or implant options can significantly reduce pain and improve her confidence to go out again.","The most likely diagnosis is **denture-induced alveolar ridge resorption with associated denture stomatitis and mucosal irritation**.

Explanation:
- Long-term denture use (11 years) often leads to progressive **alveolar bone resorption**, especially in the upper jaw.
- Poor bone structure results in ill-fitting dentures, causing **pressure points, mucosal trauma, and pain**.
- Chronic irritation can lead to **denture stomatitis** (inflammation of the mucosa under the denture).
- The pain and discomfort cause the patient to remove dentures frequently and avoid social interactions.

Management typically involves denture adjustment, relining, or fabrication of new dentures, and in some cases, surgical intervention or implant-supported prostheses to improve stability and comfort.","Hello and welcome, Since your mother is using the dentures from a long time almost 11 years now we can expect few changes in the bone structure so far.

"hi, my name is David and the doctors seem to think I have a small umbilical hernia . Today while inspecting inside my naval, a smelly brown looking discharge that also appeared somewhat bloody was in my naval. What could this be? Is it related to my hernia or do I have two problems, a yeast infection and a hernia. Also, pain that was persistent around my naval area seems to be a lot less since I was first told I may have a hernia.","Hi David. The smelly, brownish, and somewhat bloody discharge from your navel is not typical for an uncomplicated umbilical hernia. This discharge could indicate an infection, possibly due to skin irritation, a yeast or bacterial infection, or even an umbilical sinus or cyst that has become infected. The presence of blood suggests some inflammation or minor tissue damage.

While an umbilical hernia itself usually causes a bulge and sometimes discomfort or pain, it does not typically cause discharge. You may have two separate issues: the hernia and an infection or inflammation in the navel area.

Since you have discharge with odor and blood, it is important to have this evaluated promptly by a healthcare provider. They may need to examine the area, possibly take a swab for culture, and recommend appropriate treatment such as antibiotics or antifungals if an infection is confirmed.

In summary:
- The discharge is likely due to an infection or inflammation, not the hernia itself.
- You may have both an umbilical hernia and an infected navel.
- Seek medical evaluation soon to prevent complications.

If you develop increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or worsening discharge, seek urgent care.","The presence of smelly brownish discharge with some blood from the umbilicus, along with persistent pain, in a patient with a presumed small umbilical hernia suggests a possible **umbilical sinus or infected urachal remnant** rather than a simple hernia alone. 

Key points:
- Small umbilical hernias typically do not cause discharge or bleeding.
- Discharge that is smelly and brownish with blood suggests infection or chronic inflammation.
- A yeast infection usually causes itching, redness, and white discharge rather than brownish bloody discharge.
- An infected urachal remnant or an umbilical sinus can cause persistent discharge and pain.
- Another possibility is an infected or strangulated hernia with secondary infection, but this usually presents with more acute pain and systemic signs.

**Most likely diagnosis:** Infected umbilical sinus or urachal remnant with secondary infection.

**Recommendation:** The patient should undergo clinical evaluation including:
- Physical examination of the umbilicus.
- Ultrasound or imaging to assess for sinus tract, abscess, or urachal remnant.
- Culture of the discharge.
- Surgical consultation for possible excision if confirmed.

I dont have insurance so until it gets dangerous and I am almost dead, I dont like to go to the ER.  We are poor folk.","Your blood pressure readings are very high and fall into the category of a hypertensive crisis, which is a medical emergency. Specifically:

- Readings consistently above 180/120 mmHg require immediate medical attention.
- Your readings (e.g., 180/118, 198/125, 186/123, 203/115, 192/112) indicate dangerously elevated blood pressure.

Even if you feel okay, this level of blood pressure can lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.

**What you should do:**
- Seek emergency medical care immediately, especially if you have symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, vision changes, or weakness.
- If no symptoms but readings remain this high, you still need urgent evaluation.

"hi my two big toes have been fungal for two or three years. i have used no oral treatment so far , but i am going to begin today. MY BIG TOES ARE THICK AND BLACKISH WITH MY RIGHT BIG TOE HAVING A BLAKISH STREAK FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. i noticed it about two years ago appearing and disappearing when i used vinager on it. the streak is now there without my having used any vinager for two or three weeks. A dermatologist was suspected of melanoma last night, but did not recommend biopsy. my left big toe looks to have less colorful,slimmer sreaks,too. what is your view on this? I appreciate your answering the question","Given your history of long-standing fungal infection with thick, blackish discoloration of the big toenails and a persistent black streak on the right big toe, it is important to carefully evaluate the possibility of melanoma (subungual melanoma) versus fungal changes.

Key points:
- Fungal infections can cause thickened, discolored nails but usually do not cause a persistent, linear black streak.
- A black or brown streak under the nail (melanonychia) that is new, persistent, or changing can be a sign of subungual melanoma, a serious condition.
- The fact that the streak appeared and disappeared with vinegar use previously is unusual for melanoma but does not rule it out.
- The dermatologist's suspicion of melanoma is important and should not be ignored, even if biopsy was not immediately recommended.
- A biopsy or nail matrix examination is the definitive way to rule out melanoma.
- Oral antifungal treatment is appropriate for fungal infection but will not affect melanoma.

My advice:
- Follow up urgently with a dermatologist or a specialist in nail disorders.
- Insist on further evaluation, including possible biopsy, especially since the streak is persistent and involves both toes.
- Avoid self-treatment that may delay diagnosis.
- Monitor for any changes in size, color, or shape of the streak.

In summary, while fungal infection is likely present, the persistent black streak raises concern for melanoma and requires prompt specialist evaluation and possibly biopsy to exclude malignancy.","The most likely diagnosis is **onychomycosis (fungal nail infection) with subungual hematoma or fungal melanonychia**, rather than melanoma.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Long-standing fungal infection of both big toenails (thickened, blackish nails).
- Blackish streaks that intermittently appeared and disappeared with vinegar treatment, suggesting a fungal or pigment-related cause rather than a fixed melanocytic lesion.
- The streak on the right toenail has recently become continuous, which can occur with fungal melanonychia or subungual hemorrhage.
- The left toenail shows similar but less pronounced streaks, consistent with fungal involvement.
- Melanoma is a concern with persistent, irregular pigmented streaks, but the intermittent nature and bilateral involvement favor a fungal cause.
- The dermatologist suspected melanoma but did not recommend biopsy, possibly due to clinical features favoring fungal infection.

**Recommendation:**  
- Confirm diagnosis with fungal culture or KOH microscopy.
- Consider nail biopsy if clinical suspicion of melanoma remains high or if the streak changes in size, shape, or color.
- Treat fungal infection with appropriate oral antifungals (e.g., terbinafine) for several months.

If the streak persists or worsens despite antifungal treatment, or if there are signs of nail matrix involvement or nail dystrophy, a biopsy should be reconsidered to rule out subungual melanoma.","Hello,First I would like to tell that the streak you explained is unlikely to be a melanoma.

Is it normal for my BC to pretty much rid me of my period like this?","Yes, it can be normal for some birth control pills like Microgestin 1/20 Fe to significantly reduce or even stop your period. This happens because the hormones in the pill thin the uterine lining, leading to lighter bleeding or spotting instead of a full period. Spotting for less than a day is also common.

However, if you are sexually active and there is any chance of pregnancy, it’s important to rule that out with a pregnancy test.

Combined oral contraceptives like Microgestin 1/20 Fe often cause lighter, shorter, or even absent withdrawal bleeding after the hormone-free interval.

my daughter 5+ year has a stone in common duct .59cm. when she was suffering in stomach pain then we meet a child doctor then he gave us medicines but sometimes pain has come after that with his suggest we go to the dignostic lab and the result is that. now please tell me what can i do ?,"A 0.59 cm (5.9 mm) stone in the common bile duct (CBD) in a child is a significant finding and can cause intermittent pain, jaundice, or infection (cholangitis). Here are the important steps you should consider:

1. **Consult a Pediatric Gastroenterologist or Pediatric Surgeon:** This condition usually requires specialist evaluation. They can assess the severity, symptoms, and decide the best treatment.

2. **Further Imaging:** Additional imaging like an MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography) or an ultrasound may be needed to evaluate the stone's exact location and any bile duct obstruction.

3. **Treatment Options:**
   - **Endoscopic removal:** In some cases, an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) can be performed to remove the stone.
   - **Surgery:** If endoscopic removal is not possible or if complications arise, surgery may be needed.
   - **Medical management:** Sometimes, medications to dissolve stones or manage symptoms are used, but stones in the common bile duct often require removal.

4. **Monitor for Complications:** Watch for signs of worsening pain, fever, jaundice, or vomiting, which require urgent medical attention.

**Immediate advice:** Please arrange a prompt consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist or surgeon. Do not delay, as untreated CBD stones can lead to serious complications.

- Presence of a 0.59 cm stone in the common bile duct on imaging.
- Recurrent abdominal pain despite medical treatment.
- Common bile duct stones cause biliary colic and can lead to obstruction, pain, and potentially cholangitis or pancreatitis.

In a child, choledocholithiasis is less common but can occur, often secondary to hemolytic diseases, biliary anomalies, or idiopathic causes.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Presence of a 0.59 cm stone in the common bile duct on imaging.
- Recurrent abdominal pain despite medical treatment.
- Common bile duct stones cause biliary colic and can lead to obstruction, pain, and potentially cholangitis or pancreatitis.

In a child, choledocholithiasis is less common but can occur, often secondary to hemolytic diseases, biliary anomalies, or idiopathic causes.

Management typically involves removal of the stone, often via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).","Hi.noted history of choledocholithiasis (stone in the common bile duct).

","A 0.59 cm (5.9 mm) stone in the common bile duct (CBD) in a child is a significant finding and can cause intermittent pain, jaundice, or infection (cholangitis). Here are the important steps you should consider:

1. **Consult a Pediatric Gastroenterologist or Pediatric Surgeon:** This condition usually requires specialist evaluation. They can assess the severity, symptoms, and decide the best treatment.

2. **Further Imaging:** Additional imaging like an MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography) or an ultrasound may be needed to evaluate the stone's exact location and any bile duct obstruction.

3. **Treatment Options:**
   - **Endoscopic removal:** In some cases, an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) can be performed to remove the stone.
   - **Surgery:** If endoscopic removal is not possible or if complications arise, surgery may be needed.
   - **Medical management:** Sometimes, medications to dissolve stones or manage symptoms are used, but stones in the common bile duct often require removal.

4. **Monitor for Complications:** Watch for signs of worsening pain, fever, jaundice, or vomiting, which require urgent medical attention.

**Immediate advice:** Please arrange a prompt consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist or surgeon. Do not delay, as untreated CBD stones can lead to serious complications.

If you want, I can help you with information on how to prepare for the specialist visit or what questions to ask.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"Hi I had a big benign tumor on my nose .On 6th of feb that tumor was removed ... had stitches on nose and on the upper lip area ... quite big cut with many stitches .Had swelling in 1st week on my face , the 2nd week was much better ... in the end of third week again had swelling on the cheeks side of stitches ... Dr prescribed a course of Flucloaxcillin ... now there is a hard area around the stitches which is not swelling just like a lump .What it might be and how long will it take to go ?","The hard lump around your stitches after tumor removal and initial swelling is likely due to scar tissue formation or localized inflammation as part of the healing process. This is common after surgery, especially with large incisions and stitches.

Key points:
- Initial swelling is normal post-surgery.
- Recurrence of swelling in the third week could indicate mild inflammation or a localized reaction, which your doctor addressed with Flucloxacillin (an antibiotic) to prevent or treat infection.
- The hard lump is probably scar tissue (fibrosis) or a healing nodule, which can feel firm but is usually not painful or infected.
- This lump can take several weeks to months to soften and resolve as the tissue remodels.

If the lump becomes increasingly painful, red, warm, or if you develop fever, you should contact your doctor promptly as these may indicate infection.

In summary, the hard lump is likely a normal part of healing and should gradually improve over weeks to months. Continue following your doctor's advice and attend follow-up appointments for proper assessment.","The most likely diagnosis is a **suture granuloma**.

Explanation:
- Initial swelling post-surgery is common and improved as expected.
- Recurrence of swelling at 3 weeks, followed by antibiotic treatment, suggests concern for infection.
- The current presence of a hard, non-swollen lump around the stitches indicates a localized inflammatory reaction to retained suture material rather than active infection.
- Suture granulomas typically present as firm nodules at the surgical site weeks after surgery, often after initial healing.

"have a sharp pain in the bottom of the heal on left foot. pain came on slowly at first. could not step on it after a coupe hours. feels better with heat then cold and elevated but pain is continuous. did no damage to foot, no jumps, stomps, ect. foot was fine all day till that moment.","Your symptoms of sharp pain at the bottom of the heel that worsened over a few hours and makes it difficult to step on the foot could indicate plantar fasciitis or possibly a heel spur. The fact that the pain improves with heat and cold and elevation suggests inflammation.

However, since the pain came on suddenly without trauma and is continuous, other possibilities include:

- Plantar fasciitis (inflammation of the plantar fascia)
- Heel pad contusion
- Stress fracture of the calcaneus (less likely without trauma)
- Nerve irritation (e.g., Baxter’s nerve)

**Recommendations:**
- Rest and avoid putting weight on the foot as much as possible.
- Use ice to reduce inflammation (apply cold for 15-20 minutes several times a day).
- Use supportive footwear with good arch support and cushioning.
- Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help reduce pain and inflammation.
- If pain persists beyond a few days, worsens, or you develop swelling, redness, or inability to walk, see a healthcare provider for further evaluation, which may include imaging.

If you have any other symptoms like numbness, tingling, or systemic signs (fever), seek medical attention promptly.","The presentation of sharp, intense pain at the bottom of the left heel with a gradual onset that rapidly worsened, continuous pain that improves with heat, cold, and elevation, and no history of trauma suggests **plantar fasciitis** is less likely because it usually causes gradual onset pain worsening with weight-bearing over weeks, not sudden intense pain.

The sudden intense heel pain without trauma and inability to bear weight raises suspicion for **calcaneal stress fracture** or **fat pad contusion**, but these usually have some precipitating activity or trauma.

Given the acute onset of severe heel pain without trauma, one important diagnosis to consider is **acute plantar fasciitis exacerbation** or **inflammatory condition such as retrocalcaneal bursitis**. However, these typically have a more gradual onset.

Another possibility is **heel pad syndrome** or **nerve entrapment (e.g., Baxter's nerve)**, but these are usually chronic.

I got checked out at the E.R. And the dr. Said it was nerve related and the best option is to see a chiropractor. is this correct","Your symptoms of chronic, worsening back pain with swelling and bruising over the spine, especially when the area is very tender to touch, are concerning and not typical for simple nerve-related pain or mechanical back pain alone. While nerve-related pain can cause discomfort, the presence of swelling and bruising suggests there may be an underlying issue such as infection, trauma, inflammation, or possibly a more serious condition like a spinal abscess, fracture, or tumor.

A chiropractor typically treats musculoskeletal and nerve-related issues but may not be appropriate if there is an active infection, inflammation, or other serious pathology.

**Recommendations:**
1. Return to a healthcare provider urgently for a thorough evaluation.
2. You may need imaging studies (X-ray, MRI) and blood tests to rule out infection, fracture, or other serious causes.
3. If you develop fever, worsening neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness, bowel/bladder changes), seek emergency care immediately.

- Pain severe enough to disrupt sleep and cause nocturnal awakening
- Localized swelling and extreme tenderness over the spine
- Development of bruising in the affected area

"Sure! I have lateral knee pain just below the patella, about 45 degrees. There is pinpoint pain on a particular spot, and the pain can radiate down my outer left leg, and sometimes up into the thigh aswell. I can go for a few days with no real pain, and then it will start again. I had no actual injury, however I am a full time professional snowboarder, spending 60-70 hours/week locked into a stance which has my left foot forward and my body slightly rotated to the left. I realise this puts a lot of pressure on my right leg, as I am driving most of my weight through the right foot/knee/hip. The pain began nearly a month ago, and I really can t specifiy what sets it off. Sometimes walking is painlesss, sometimes it hurts. I have looked into the possibility of ITBS, what do you think? Thanks, Kylie","Hi Kylie,

Based on your description—lateral knee pain just below the patella at about 45 degrees of knee flexion, pinpoint tenderness, and pain radiating down the outer leg and sometimes up into the thigh—iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is a very plausible diagnosis. ITBS typically causes pain on the outside of the knee, often worsened by activities involving knee flexion and extension, and is common in athletes with repetitive knee loading and biomechanical stress.

Your professional snowboarding stance, with prolonged weight bearing and rotation, likely contributes to repetitive strain on the lateral knee structures, including the IT band. The intermittent nature of your pain and absence of a specific injury also fit with ITBS.

However, other possible causes to consider include:
- Lateral meniscus irritation
- Lateral collateral ligament strain
- Referred pain from hip or lumbar spine issues

I recommend:
- Rest and modification of activities that aggravate the pain
- Stretching and foam rolling of the IT band and surrounding muscles
- Strengthening hip abductors and core muscles to improve biomechanics
- Applying ice to reduce inflammation
- Consulting a sports medicine physician or physical therapist for a thorough assessment and tailored rehab program

If pain worsens, becomes constant, or you develop swelling or instability, seek prompt medical evaluation.

In summary, your symptoms and history strongly suggest ITBS, but a professional assessment will confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

Stay safe on the slopes!","The patient's presentation of lateral knee pain just below the patella on the right side, localized to a pinpoint spot, with intermittent symptoms and radiation down the outer leg and sometimes up into the thigh, in the context of prolonged weight bearing in a rotated stance, is suggestive of **Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS)**.

Key points supporting ITBS diagnosis:
- Lateral knee pain localized near the lateral femoral epicondyle or just below the patella.
- Pain often described as sharp or pinpoint.
- Symptoms can radiate along the lateral thigh or leg due to irritation of the IT band or associated structures.
- Common in athletes with repetitive knee flexion-extension and biomechanical stress, such as snowboarders with asymmetric stance and prolonged weight bearing.
- No preceding injury but gradual onset related to activity and posture.

Other diagnoses like lateral meniscal injury or lateral collateral ligament injury are less likely due to absence of trauma and intermittent nature with symptom-free intervals.

**Most likely diagnosis: Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS).**","Hello, I have studied your case. This can be ITS. Gradual knee flexion and extension in lateral position will help. Use ice packs to reduce swelling, inflammation and pain. Physiotherapy with ultrasound and Tens will help you, Foam Roller IT Band exercises will help you can learn them from your physiotherapist.

The patient spends 60-70 hours per week in a snowboarding stance with the left foot forward and body slightly rotated to the left, placing increased weight bearing on the right lower extremity. The pain started approximately one month ago without a clear aggravating factor. The patient wonders if iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) could be the diagnosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",model_response_conv,doctor_output,model_response_og,"The patient's presentation of lateral knee pain just below the patella on the right side, localized to a pinpoint spot, with intermittent symptoms and radiation down the outer leg and sometimes up into the thigh, in the context of prolonged weight bearing in a rotated stance, is suggestive of **Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS)**.

Key points supporting ITBS diagnosis:
- Lateral knee pain localized near the lateral femoral epicondyle or just below the patella.
- Pain often described as sharp or pinpoint.
- Symptoms can radiate along the lateral thigh or leg due to irritation of the IT band or associated structures.
- Common in athletes with repetitive knee flexion-extension and biomechanical stress, such as snowboarders with asymmetric stance and prolonged weight bearing.
- No preceding injury but gradual onset related to activity and posture.

Other diagnoses like lateral meniscal injury or lateral collateral ligament injury are less likely due to absence of trauma and intermittent nature with symptom-free intervals.

**Most likely diagnosis: Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS).**","Hello, I have studied your case. This can be ITS. Gradual knee flexion and extension in lateral position will help. Use ice packs to reduce swelling, inflammation and pain. Physiotherapy with ultrasound and Tens will help you, Foam Roller IT Band exercises will help you can learn them from your physiotherapist. For early healing you can take Tab Colin [it C] and antioxidant with anti-inflammatory Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take care","Hi Kylie,

Based on your description—lateral knee pain just below the patella at about 45 degrees of knee flexion, pinpoint tenderness, and pain radiating down the outer leg and sometimes up into the thigh—iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is a very plausible diagnosis. ITBS typically causes pain on the outside of the knee, often worsened by activities involving knee flexion and extension, and is common in athletes with repetitive knee loading and biomechanical stress.

Your professional snowboarding stance, with prolonged weight bearing and rotation, likely contributes to repetitive strain on the lateral knee structures, including the IT band. The intermittent nature of your pain and absence of a specific injury also fit with ITBS.

However, other possible causes to consider include:
- Lateral meniscus irritation
- Lateral collateral ligament strain
- Referred pain from hip or lumbar spine issues

I recommend:
- Rest and modification of activities that aggravate the pain
- Stretching and foam rolling of the IT band and surrounding muscles
- Strengthening hip abductors and core muscles to improve biomechanics
- Applying ice to reduce inflammation
- Consulting a sports medicine physician or physical therapist for a thorough assessment and tailored rehab program

If pain worsens, becomes constant, or you develop swelling or instability, seek prompt medical evaluation.

In summary, your symptoms and history strongly suggest ITBS, but a professional assessment will confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

"Hi, I am 36 weeks pregnant. All my reports have been fine considering baby weight, amniotic fluid & doppler flow. However, my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck. Can I still have a normal delivery? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position, before my delivery date which is 14th Feb.?","At 36 weeks, it is still possible for your baby to turn from a head-up (breech) position to a head-down (cephalic) position before delivery. Many babies continue to move and can settle into the head-down position by around 37-38 weeks.

The single loop of cord around the neck (nuchal cord) is relatively common and usually does not prevent a normal delivery. Your healthcare provider will monitor the situation closely during labor.

To summarize:
- There is a good chance your baby may turn head-down before your due date.
- The nuchal cord alone typically does not contraindicate vaginal delivery.
- Continue regular prenatal visits and ultrasound monitoring.
- Your doctor will decide the safest delivery method based on the baby's position and overall condition closer to your delivery date.

If the baby remains breech near term, your doctor may discuss options such as attempting an external cephalic version (ECV) or planning a cesarean section.

Stay in close contact with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.","The most likely diagnosis is **breech presentation at 36 weeks gestation with a nuchal cord (single loop of umbilical cord around the fetal neck)**.

Key points:
- Breech presentation at 36 weeks is common and often resolves spontaneously by term.
- A single nuchal cord is a common finding and usually not associated with adverse outcomes if Doppler and fetal well-being are normal.
- Since the baby is at 36 weeks, there is still a good chance the fetus may turn to a head-down (cephalic) position before delivery at 40 weeks.

No immediate intervention is required, but follow-up ultrasounds and clinical exams are recommended to monitor fetal position closer to delivery. If the breech persists near term, options like external cephalic version (ECV) or planned cesarean delivery can be discussed.","Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. So if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. However, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. Ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. Going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. However, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. In the US, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. It works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. Regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. So the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. If you are considering having a version, I suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks.

"Yesterday, I slipped and hit my tailbone on a rock at the lake, then grew very weak and lost consciousness. I was unconscious for about a minute, then slowly came back unable to see for about 10 minutes. I had had a meal probably 5 hours prior to this, biscuits and gravy with a cup of coffee, then drank 2 beers roughly 2 hours prior to the incident. I didn t feel hungry, tired or thirsty at all when the incident occurred. What could cause something like this to happen?","Your symptoms after the fall—loss of consciousness for about a minute, followed by temporary vision loss—are concerning and suggest a possible head or spinal injury, even though you hit your tailbone. The weakness and brief unconsciousness could indicate a concussion, a brain injury, or a spinal cord injury. Alcohol consumption (2 beers) may have contributed to impaired balance or increased the severity of the injury.

Key possibilities include:
- Concussion or traumatic brain injury from the fall
- Spinal cord injury affecting neurological function
- Vasovagal syncope triggered by pain or trauma
- Less likely but possible: cardiac arrhythmia or other medical causes

Given the severity of your symptoms, you should seek immediate medical evaluation to rule out serious injury.

"morning dr iam AAAAAAA im having ipills reglarly after having sex bt this tym my my periods not cum , and i check also i am not pregnant so is this the side effect of ipills or what plz guide me","Hello AAAAAAA, missing your period after taking emergency contraceptive pills (i-pills) can sometimes happen as a side effect. These pills contain hormones that can temporarily disrupt your menstrual cycle, causing a delay or irregular bleeding. Since you have confirmed you are not pregnant, this is likely due to the i-pills.

However, if your period is more than a week late, or if you experience severe pain or unusual symptoms, it is important to see a healthcare provider for further evaluation. For now, try to monitor your cycle and maintain regular follow-up if needed.","The most likely diagnosis is **menstrual irregularity due to frequent use of emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs)**.

Explanation:
- Emergency contraceptive pills contain high doses of hormones (usually levonorgestrel or ulipristal acetate) that can disrupt the normal hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle.
- Frequent or repeated use of ECPs can lead to changes in the timing, flow, or even temporary absence of menstruation.
- Since pregnancy has been ruled out, the absence of menstruation is most likely a side effect of the hormonal impact of the emergency contraceptives.
- It is advisable to avoid repeated use of ECPs as a regular contraceptive method and consider a more reliable, regular contraceptive method to maintain menstrual regularity and avoid side effects.

Regarding his medications:
- **Ursocol (Ursodeoxycholic acid)** is generally not known to raise blood pressure or cause bleeding.
- **Orlimac 120 (likely a statin or similar medication)** typically does not cause nosebleeds or high BP.
- **Allopurinol** is used for uric acid control and usually does not cause bleeding or hypertension.

Possible causes for his symptoms include:
- Elevated blood pressure itself can cause nosebleeds.
- Bleeding disorders or platelet dysfunction.
- Nasal trauma or local nasal pathology.
- Side effects or interactions of medications affecting clotting.
- Other underlying conditions like liver dysfunction affecting clotting factors.

**Immediate recommendations:**
1. Apply firm pressure to the nose, leaning forward to reduce swallowing blood.
2. Seek urgent medical care to control bleeding and evaluate blood pressure.
3. Blood tests including CBC, coagulation profile, liver function tests, and uric acid levels should be done.
4. Review all medications with a healthcare provider.

Do not delay medical attention, especially if bleeding is heavy or does not stop within 20 minutes.","The most likely diagnosis is **epistaxis secondary to hypertension** (hypertensive epistaxis).

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- The patient has elevated blood pressure (140/100 mmHg), which can cause rupture of fragile nasal blood vessels leading to profuse nosebleeds.
- No other obvious causes such as trauma, coagulopathy, or nasal pathology are mentioned.
- The history of fatty liver disease and medications (ursodeoxycholic acid, orlimac, allopurinol) are less likely to directly cause severe epistaxis.
- Persistent and difficult-to-control nosebleeds in the setting of elevated blood pressure strongly suggest hypertensive epistaxis.

Recommendation:
- Control blood pressure urgently.
- Local measures to stop bleeding (nasal packing, cauterization).
- Evaluate for any underlying coagulopathy or platelet dysfunction if bleeding persists.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1. **Color of liquid leaking from the nose that is a sign of a concussion:**  
   Clear or slightly yellowish fluid leaking from the nose (rhinorrhea) can be cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This is a serious sign indicating a possible skull fracture and brain injury, such as a concussion or more severe traumatic brain injury.

2. **Kind of abnormal eye pupil exam shown:**  
   Common abnormal pupil findings in concussion or brain injury include:  
   - Unequal pupil size (anisocoria)  
   - Non-reactive (fixed) pupils  
   - Sluggish pupillary light reflex  
   These abnormalities suggest increased intracranial pressure or brain injury.

3. **Two tests done to diagnose a concussion:**  
   - **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS):** Assesses level of consciousness.  
   - **Neurocognitive testing:** Such as the SCAT5 (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool) or computerized tests like ImPACT, which evaluate memory, attention, and processing speed.

If you suspect a concussion or see any of these signs, seek medical evaluation promptly.","The most likely diagnosis based on the inquiry is **concussion (mild traumatic brain injury)**.

Here are the answers to the patient's questions:

1. **Color of nasal discharge indicating concussion:**  
   - Clear, watery nasal discharge may indicate **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak**, which can occur with skull fractures associated with concussion or more severe brain injury. This is not typical nasal mucus but rather CSF rhinorrhea.

2. **Abnormal pupil examination findings in concussion:**  
   - Pupils may be **unequal (anisocoria)**  
   - Pupils may show **sluggish or non-reactive response to light**  
   - However, significant pupil abnormalities are more common in more severe brain injuries rather than isolated concussion.

3. **Two clinical tests used to diagnose concussion:**  
   - **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS):** Assesses level of consciousness. A score of 13-15 is typical in concussion.  
   - **Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC):** Evaluates orientation, immediate memory, concentration, and delayed recall.  
   - Other tools include the **Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT)** and neurological examination focusing on balance, coordination, and cognitive function.

**Summary:**  
- Clear nasal discharge (CSF leak) may suggest skull fracture with brain injury.

i am a 46 year old female 5 ft 7 weigh 120lbs i am continually having finger nail infections where the nail turns white and red and sore below nail bed i am treating it with polyfax ointment and daktacort cream prescribed by my doctor but not having great results any suggestions would be welcome tks,"Your symptoms of recurrent fingernail infections with white and red discoloration and soreness under the nail bed suggest a possible chronic paronychia or a mixed bacterial and fungal nail infection. Since topical treatments like Polyfax (an antibiotic ointment) and Daktacort (an antifungal and steroid cream) have not been fully effective, here are some suggestions:

1. **Confirm Diagnosis:** Consider seeing a dermatologist or infectious disease specialist for nail culture or biopsy to identify the exact cause (bacterial, fungal, or both).

2. **Oral Medications:** Oral antifungal or antibiotic therapy may be necessary for deeper or persistent infections, as topical treatments often do not penetrate the nail bed well.

3. **Nail Care:** Keep nails dry and clean, avoid trauma or irritants, and avoid prolonged exposure to water or chemicals.

4. **Avoid Steroid Overuse:** Prolonged use of steroid creams can sometimes worsen infections.

5. **Consider Underlying Conditions:** Check for diabetes or immune issues that may predispose to recurrent infections.

Please follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and tailored treatment.","The patient's presentation of recurrent fingernail infections with whitening, redness, and soreness beneath the nail bed, along with poor response to topical antibacterial (polyfax) and antifungal/steroid (daktacort) creams, suggests a diagnosis of **chronic paronychia**.

**Key points supporting this diagnosis:**
- Chronic paronychia is an inflammation of the proximal and lateral nail folds, often caused by repeated exposure to moisture, irritants, or allergens.
- It typically presents with redness, swelling, tenderness, and sometimes secondary infection.
- The whitening under the nail (often due to nail fold inflammation and secondary fungal infection) is common.
- It is often resistant to topical antibiotics and steroids alone.
- Treatment usually involves avoiding irritants, keeping the area dry, and sometimes systemic antifungals or antibiotics if secondary infection is present.

**Other considerations:**
- Onychomycosis (fungal nail infection) can cause whitening and nail changes but usually involves the nail plate itself rather than the nail folds.
- Acute bacterial paronychia is more sudden and often associated with pus formation.
- Psoriasis or eczema can affect nails but usually have other skin findings.

**Summary:**
Most likely diagnosis: **Chronic paronychia**. Further management may require systemic antifungal therapy and protective measures to prevent moisture exposure.","Welcome to Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concern for the finger nail infection. Apparently you have some sort of fungal finger nail infection which usually does not respond to Daktacort cream or Poly fax ointment.

"Hello Doctor,5 years back i had a severe headache followed by visual disturbance in my left eye lasted for few minutes.i am diagnosed with a calcified lesion at right occipital lobe. taken albendazole for a month and oxetol for 2 years. recently i had a visual disturbance again without headache. During last 4 months i have a feeling of right knee tingling intermittently. Why is this tingling happening. Should i have to continue oxetol.. then for how much time. Is there any procedure to remove lesion. Till today i dont have any record of seizure.","Thank you for sharing your history. Here is an overview based on your information:

1. **Calcified lesion in right occipital lobe:**  
   This is likely a healed or inactive lesion, possibly from neurocysticercosis or another cause. Calcified lesions usually represent scar tissue and are not active infections.

2. **Visual disturbances:**  
   Since the lesion is in the right occipital lobe (which processes vision from the left visual field), transient visual symptoms can occur due to irritation or minor seizures (even if you haven't had full seizures). Visual symptoms without headache may suggest focal neurological events.

3. **Right knee tingling:**  
   Tingling in the right knee could be due to several reasons:  
   - Peripheral nerve irritation or neuropathy (e.g., from diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or nerve compression)  
   - A new neurological issue unrelated to the brain lesion  
   - Rarely, a subtle seizure or focal neurological event affecting sensory pathways

4. **Oxetol (likely Oxcarbazepine):**  
   This is an anti-epileptic drug often used to prevent seizures. If you have not had seizures, the need for long-term use should be carefully evaluated by your neurologist. Prolonged use without seizures may not be necessary, but stopping should be done under medical supervision.

5. **Lesion removal:**  
   Surgical removal of a calcified lesion in the occipital lobe is generally not recommended unless it causes frequent seizures or other disabling symptoms. Most calcified lesions are stable and do not require surgery.

**Recommendations:**  
- Please consult your neurologist for a detailed evaluation of your new symptoms (visual disturbance and knee tingling). They may recommend imaging (MRI), nerve conduction studies, or blood tests to identify the cause of tingling.  
- Discuss the duration and necessity of Oxetol with your neurologist; do not stop or change the dose without medical advice.  
- If seizures develop, treatment and management will be adjusted accordingly.  
- Surgical options are rarely needed for calcified lesions unless symptoms are severe and refractory.

If symptoms worsen or new neurological signs appear, seek prompt medical attention.","The patient's history of a calcified lesion in the right occipital lobe treated with albendazole suggests a prior neurocysticercosis infection. The initial presentation with severe headache and transient visual disturbance in the left eye aligns with occipital lobe involvement.

Current symptoms:
- New episode of visual disturbance without headache (likely related to occipital lobe dysfunction)
- Intermittent tingling in the right knee (suggests possible sensory pathway involvement, possibly cortical or subcortical)

No seizures have occurred, which is somewhat atypical but possible.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Calcified neurocysticercosis lesion with intermittent neurological symptoms due to gliosis or residual scarring in the right occipital lobe.**

Explanation:  
- The calcified lesion is a sequela of neurocysticercosis.  
- Visual disturbances correspond to the right occipital lobe lesion affecting the left visual field.  
- Tingling in the right knee may be due to cortical irritation or involvement of sensory pathways adjacent to the lesion.  
- No active infection is likely given the calcified nature and prior treatment.  
- Symptoms are likely due to residual scarring, gliosis, or possibly small ischemic changes around the lesion.

Further evaluation with MRI and possibly EEG may help rule out subclinical seizures or other causes. However, the clinical picture fits with sequelae of neurocysticercosis.

**Summary:**  
Post-neurocysticercosis calcified lesion causing intermittent neurological symptoms (visual disturbance and sensory symptoms) due to residual brain changes in the right occipital lobe.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. A calcified lesion is most often due to a healed tape worm infection, called as neurocysticercosis. Since the worm is already dead, as suggested by calcification, albendazole is not necessary.

"I have been suffering from pain for about three years now.  I sometimes have to resort to taking pain killers to manage it.  The pain is located around the lower right side of my neck, down my shoulder and under my right shoulder blade.  I have seen two doctors about it, one is an internist.  They dont seem to know what is causing it and seem to be reluctant to think it is anything but psycological.  The internist, after looking at me for ten minutes, suggested it was localised fibromyalgia.  They also keep thinking I am somehow addicted to the pain killers when I only take half the dosage prescribed 2-3 times a week. I am very confused, frustrated and I dont know what to do. I have tried physical therapy, message therapy, hot or cold pads, resting, exercising.  It seemed to make the paid worse when I attempted them. If you have any suggestions I would be extremely greatful.","I'm sorry to hear about your ongoing pain and frustration. Chronic pain in the lower right neck, shoulder, and under the shoulder blade can have multiple causes, including musculoskeletal issues (like nerve impingement, muscle strain, or cervical spine problems), referred pain from other areas, or less commonly, systemic conditions.

Given that physical therapy and other conservative measures have worsened your pain, and the diagnosis remains unclear, here are some suggestions:

1. **Further Diagnostic Evaluation:**
   - Consider seeing a specialist such as a neurologist or an orthopedic spine specialist for a detailed assessment.
   - Imaging studies like an MRI of the cervical spine and shoulder may help identify nerve compression, disc issues, or soft tissue problems.
   - Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies can assess nerve function if nerve involvement is suspected.

2. **Pain Management Specialist:**
   - A pain specialist can offer a multidisciplinary approach, including medication adjustments, nerve blocks, or other interventions.

3. **Second Opinion:**
   - If you feel your concerns are not being fully addressed, seeking a second or third opinion from specialists experienced in chronic pain or musculoskeletal disorders may be helpful.

4. **Psychological Support:**
   - Chronic pain can have psychological impacts, and sometimes psychological factors can amplify pain perception. A psychologist or psychiatrist specializing in pain management can provide coping strategies without implying the pain is ""all in your head.""

5. **Avoid Self-Medication:**
   - Continue to use pain medications as prescribed and avoid increasing doses without medical advice.

6. **Keep a Pain Diary:**
   - Document your pain intensity, triggers, activities, and medication use. This can help doctors better understand your condition.

If you experience new symptoms like weakness, numbness, severe headaches, fever, or unexplained weight loss, seek immediate medical attention.

Ultimately, persistent pain warrants thorough evaluation and a multidisciplinary approach. Please consider consulting a specialist for further workup and tailored treatment.","The patient's symptoms—chronic, localized pain in the lower right neck extending to the shoulder and under the shoulder blade, lasting three years, with worsening pain after physical therapy and exercise—suggest a neuropathic or musculoskeletal cause rather than fibromyalgia or purely psychological origin.

Key points:
- Pain localized to a specific region (lower right neck, shoulder, under scapula)
- Chronic duration (3 years)
- Worsening with physical therapy and exercise (suggesting mechanical or nerve irritation)
- Intermittent use of painkillers at reduced doses
- No improvement with typical conservative measures

**Most likely diagnosis: Cervical radiculopathy or a nerve entrapment syndrome (e.g., dorsal scapular nerve or long thoracic nerve entrapment).**

Rationale:
- Cervical radiculopathy from nerve root compression (e.g., C5-C6) can cause neck pain radiating to the shoulder and scapular area.
- Nerve entrapment syndromes can cause localized neuropathic pain in the shoulder blade region.
- Fibromyalgia typically causes widespread pain, not localized to one side or region.
- Psychological causes are less likely given the clear anatomical distribution and chronicity.
- Worsening with exercise and physical therapy may indicate mechanical nerve irritation or instability.

**Recommended next steps:**
- Detailed neurological examination focusing on sensory, motor, and reflex changes.
- Imaging studies such as cervical spine MRI to assess for disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, or other structural causes.
- Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies to evaluate nerve function.
- Referral to a neurologist or pain specialist for further evaluation and management.

In summary, the most likely diagnosis is cervical radiculopathy or a related nerve entrapment syndrome causing chronic localized neuropathic pain.","Hi, Thank you for asking Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query. Cervical spondylosis should be ruled out in your condition. Nerve compression from that can give such type of pain.

I have felt incredibly sick for two days. I have extreme pain in my stomach. It never goes away but sometimes dulls for about  a hour. And this morning was the worst I felt like death and I vomited a thick vomit with black chunks. Whats happening to me?,"Your symptoms—severe, persistent stomach pain and vomiting thick vomit with black chunks—are concerning and could indicate a serious condition such as gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from a stomach ulcer or another serious issue.

You need urgent medical evaluation. Please go to the emergency room immediately or call emergency services. Do not delay, as this can be life-threatening.","The presentation of severe, persistent stomach pain for two days, with intermittent temporary relief, followed by intensified pain and vomiting thick vomitus containing black chunks, is highly suggestive of **gastric or duodenal ulcer with possible bleeding and/or perforation**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Severe, persistent abdominal pain: consistent with ulcer-related complications.
- Temporary decrease in pain: may indicate intermittent relief from ulcer-related irritation.
- Vomiting black chunks: likely represents ""coffee ground"" vomitus or blood clots, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

"hi,i was about to go abroad for a job and i received my medical exam and it was diagnosed that i have a scar, fibrotic ptb. i have a dry cough but i have no fever.was this scar curable? was this scar may always affect everytime i go for medical exam ?","A fibrotic PTB (pulmonary tuberculosis) scar indicates that you had a past TB infection that has healed but left some fibrous tissue (scar) in your lungs. This scar itself is not an active infection and is generally not curable because it represents permanent lung tissue changes after healing.

Key points:
- The scar is a sign of old, healed TB, not active disease.
- It usually does not cause symptoms, but a dry cough can sometimes persist.
- The scar will likely remain visible on chest X-rays or scans during future medical exams.
- It should not affect your health significantly if you have no active TB symptoms (no fever, weight loss, night sweats).
- You may need periodic monitoring to ensure no reactivation of TB occurs.

If you have concerns or persistent symptoms, consult a pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and advice.","The most likely diagnosis is **healed (inactive) pulmonary tuberculosis with fibrotic scarring**.

Key points:
- The scar on chest imaging indicates past tuberculosis infection that has healed.
- The dry cough may be due to residual lung changes but no active infection.
- Absence of fever and other systemic symptoms suggests no active TB.
- Fibrotic scars from healed TB are not curable because they represent permanent lung tissue changes.
- These scars can show up on future chest X-rays and may be flagged during medical exams, but they do not indicate active disease.
- The patient is generally not infectious and does not require TB treatment unless there is evidence of reactivation.

- It usually does not cause symptoms, but a dry cough can sometimes persist.
- The scar will likely remain visible on chest X-rays or scans during future medical exams.
- It should not affect your health significantly if you have no active TB symptoms (no fever, weight loss, night sweats).
- You may need periodic monitoring to ensure no reactivation of TB occurs.

If you have concerns or persistent symptoms, consult a pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and advice.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. You are having fibrotic scar due to old healed tuberculosis in the past. So i advice you to consult pulmonologist and get done1. CT thorax2. Bronchoscopy and BAD (Bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis to rule out active tuberculosis. CT thorax is far better than chest x-ray for the evaluation of fibrotic scar. Bronchoscopy and BAD analysis is more superior than routine sputum examination to rule out active tuberculosis. If both are normal and negative for active tuberculosis, then you can argue with visa authority about not having active, infectious tuberculosis and your x-ray lesions are only healed, inactive scar lesions. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"I have red blotches that itch and have appeared on my left cheek and back of left hand, also on the back of my right hand and another on my right fore arm. In addition to these spots that are red, round and itch, my lips were also swollen when I got up this morning. There are no blisters or previous injury. Benadryl cream helps with itching. No fever but do have headache. I have had this happen a few times the past year and each time the spots come back on the same areas. It lasts about a week. It s really bothers me when my lips and face swell up.","Your symptoms of recurring red, itchy, round blotches on specific areas of your skin, along with intermittent lip and facial swelling, suggest a possible allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. The fact that Benadryl cream helps with itching supports an allergic or histamine-related cause. The recurrent nature and involvement of lips and face swelling raise concern for episodic angioedema or a chronic urticarial condition.

Key considerations include:
- Allergic contact dermatitis or recurrent urticaria
- Angioedema (especially with lip swelling)
- Possible triggers such as foods, medications, or environmental allergens

Given the swelling of your lips and face, which can sometimes indicate a more serious allergic reaction, it is important to:
- Avoid known or suspected allergens
- Consider seeing an allergist or dermatologist for evaluation and possible allergy testing
- Have an emergency plan if swelling worsens or you develop difficulty breathing or swallowing

If symptoms worsen or you develop breathing difficulty, seek emergency care immediately.

In summary, your symptoms likely represent a recurrent allergic skin reaction with episodic angioedema. A specialist evaluation is recommended for diagnosis and management.","The presentation of recurrent, red, round, itchy blotches on exposed areas (cheek, hands, forearm) lasting about a week, along with lip swelling without blisters, suggests a hypersensitivity or allergic reaction pattern.

Key points:
- Recurrent, itchy, red round lesions on sun-exposed areas suggest **polymorphous light eruption (PMLE)** or a form of **photosensitive dermatitis**.
- Lip swelling without blisters points toward **angioedema**, possibly related to an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.
- No fever and only headache reported, which are nonspecific.

Given the recurrent nature, distribution on sun-exposed skin, and itching relieved by topical antihistamine, the most likely diagnosis is:

"hi i had my wisdom teeth pulled out five years ago. i recently went for a dental check up and the dentist said i have an abnormality on my bottom right side where my wisdom tooth was removed,like a bump he said.so he referred me to a specialist..i have no pain and the bump is not visible when i see inside my mouth..what could this be?","A bump in the area where a wisdom tooth was removed, especially years after extraction and without pain or visible signs inside the mouth, could be due to several possibilities, including:

1. **Bone Remodeling or Exostosis:** After tooth extraction, the jawbone can sometimes form a benign bony growth or irregularity.
2. **Residual Cyst or Granuloma:** Occasionally, a cyst or granuloma can develop from leftover tissue after extraction.
3. **Scar Tissue or Soft Tissue Growth:** Soft tissue changes or fibrous tissue growth under the mucosa may present as a bump.
4. **Other Benign Lesions:** Such as a benign tumor or localized swelling.

Since you have no pain and no visible bump inside the mouth, it is less likely to be an infection or aggressive lesion, but the specialist will likely perform imaging (like an X-ray or CBCT scan) and possibly a clinical exam or biopsy to determine the exact cause.

It is good that you are seeing a specialist for further evaluation. Follow their advice for diagnosis and management. If you develop pain, swelling, or other symptoms, seek prompt care.","The most likely diagnosis is a **bone exostosis** or **buccal cortical bone prominence** at the site of the previous wisdom tooth extraction. This is a benign bony growth that can develop as part of the healing and remodeling process after tooth removal. Since the bump is not visible inside the mouth and the patient is asymptomatic, it is unlikely to be an infection or cyst.

Other less likely possibilities include:
- Residual or impacted root fragment causing localized bone expansion
- A benign cyst or tumor (less common without symptoms)

However, given the history and presentation, a benign bony prominence is the most probable cause.

Recommendation: The dentist may take a radiograph to confirm the nature of the bump and rule out other pathologies. If asymptomatic and benign, no treatment may be necessary.","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The bump over the wisdom tooth region could be a flabby soft tissue or irrational fibrous secondary to irritation from the opposing tooth.

1. **Regarding Meftal SRP (Mefenamic Acid):**  
- Mefenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief.  
- It can be used in children but only under strict medical supervision.  
- Typically, it is prescribed for short durations (usually not more than 7 days) due to potential side effects like stomach irritation.  
- You should not give it without your doctor’s approval, especially since your daughter is young.

2. **Other possible causes of abdominal pain in children with normal ultrasound:**  
- Functional abdominal pain (common in children)  
- Constipation  
- Gastrointestinal infections or inflammation (e.g., gastritis)  
- Urinary tract infection (may need urine tests)  
- Food intolerances or allergies  
- Stress or anxiety  
- Other less common causes (e.g., appendicitis, though usually with other signs)

3. **Recommendations:**  
- Avoid self-medicating; consult your pediatrician before continuing or changing medications.  
- Keep a pain diary noting timing, location, severity, and any associated symptoms (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.).  
- Ensure she stays hydrated and maintains a balanced diet.  
- If pain worsens, or new symptoms develop (fever, vomiting, blood in stool/urine), seek immediate medical attention.

Please follow up with your pediatrician for further evaluation and appropriate management.","In a 7-year-old child with a two-week history of abdominal pain, normal ultrasound findings, and no response to initial pain treatment, the most likely diagnosis is **functional abdominal pain** (also known as functional abdominal pain syndrome or a functional gastrointestinal disorder).

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Duration: Two weeks of abdominal pain.
- Normal ultrasound: No structural abnormalities detected.
- Lack of response to initial analgesic (drotin SRP) and switch to meftal SRP (an antispasmodic/analgesic) suggests pain may be functional rather than due to an organic cause.

Other causes like infections, appendicitis, or other organic diseases are less likely with a normal ultrasound and subacute presentation.

- Consider evaluation for functional abdominal pain.
- Address psychosocial factors, diet, and provide reassurance.

"I rolled my ankle 2 weeks ago, and it swelled all over my foot and mid way up my shin. It is still bruised on both side of my foot and up the front part of my shin and the back of my calf. The only part that is swollen is the outside of my ankle on my left foot. My two smallest toes on my left foot have also been going numb frequently and there is still quite a bit of pain. I thought because I could walk on it, it would be just fine. I didn t get it x-rayed. Could it be broken? How long should it take for the outside of my ankle to look normal again and not be so swollen? Should my toes be going numb?","Your symptoms—persistent swelling localized to the outside of your ankle, extensive bruising, ongoing pain, and numbness in your two smallest toes—are concerning and suggest that your injury may be more serious than a simple sprain. 

It is possible that you have a fracture (broken bone), ligament damage, or nerve involvement. The numbness in your toes indicates possible nerve compression or injury, which requires prompt evaluation.

Typically, swelling from a mild ankle sprain improves significantly within 1-2 weeks, and bruising fades over 2-3 weeks. Persistent swelling after 2 weeks, especially localized swelling and numbness, is not typical and warrants medical assessment.

**Recommendations:**
- You should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible for a thorough physical exam.
- An X-ray or other imaging (like MRI) may be needed to rule out fractures or ligament injuries.
- Numbness should not be ignored, as it may indicate nerve involvement.
- Avoid putting excessive weight on the injured foot until evaluated.

In summary, your injury may be more serious than initially thought, and prompt medical evaluation is important to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.","The presentation suggests a **lateral ankle injury with possible nerve involvement**. Key points:

- Injury 2 weeks ago with initial swelling of foot and mid-shin.
- Bruising on both sides of foot, front of shin, and back of calf.
- Current swelling localized to lateral ankle.
- Frequent numbness in the two smallest toes (likely involving the lateral plantar nerve or sural nerve distribution).
- Persistent pain.
- Able to bear weight.
- No imaging done yet.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
A **lateral ankle sprain with associated peroneal nerve irritation or entrapment**.

Explanation:  
- The lateral ankle is the most common site for sprains, often involving the anterior talofibular ligament.
- Bruising extending to the calf and shin suggests significant soft tissue injury or possible hematoma tracking.
- Numbness in the two smallest toes points to involvement of the lateral plantar nerve (branch of tibial nerve) or sural nerve, which can be irritated by swelling or hematoma.
- Ability to bear weight makes a fracture less likely but does not exclude it.

**Recommendation:**  
- Imaging (X-ray, possibly MRI) to rule out fracture or tendon injury.
- Neurological assessment for nerve function.
- Consider referral to orthopedics or podiatry.

"My dad has been killed recently by a pulmonologist named Dr Vamsi Krishna from Siddhartha Hospital (kakinada) treating him in icu for bacterial and fungal pneumonia. I wanted to know is pneumonia that serious killer? First my dad was admitted into ICU on May 30, 2014 after seeing his lungs xray and he was put in ICU for 5 days then shifted to room then in 10 days he was discharged. After coming home we thought he was recovering well but on July 2 again he felt severe shortness in breath so when took to Siddhartha Hispital, Kakinad, Dr. Vamsi Krishna said that the lung infection came again and this time its fungal (previously he was treated for bacterial pneumonia) and so my dad was directly admitted into ICU with ventilators support. The ICU patient dies on july 12 and the reason Dr.Vamsi Krishna said is Sudden Cardiac Arrest and it can happen anytime. Other healtChatDoctorplications of my dad are diabetes and stints in chest. My question is if there is fungal infection that serious as to be admitted into ICU on July 2 why did the Dr fail to diagonise it when visited him on June 30 apart of weekly checkup? I felt the culture test for presense of fungal infection was done late and reports came very late on July 9.","I'm very sorry for your loss. Pneumonia, whether bacterial or fungal, can be very serious, especially in patients with underlying conditions like diabetes and heart disease (stents). Fungal pneumonia is often more difficult to diagnose and treat than bacterial pneumonia and can progress rapidly, requiring ICU care and ventilator support.

Regarding your concerns:

1. **Severity of Pneumonia:** Both bacterial and fungal pneumonia can be life-threatening, particularly in patients with weakened immune systems or other health issues. Fungal infections often require specialized tests and take longer to identify.

2. **Diagnosis Timing:** Fungal cultures and tests typically take several days to weeks to yield results, which can delay diagnosis. It is common for fungal infections to be diagnosed after initial bacterial treatment if symptoms persist or worsen.

3. **ICU Admission:** The need for ICU care on July 2 suggests the infection had worsened significantly. It is possible that the fungal infection developed or became detectable only after the initial discharge.

4. **Sudden Cardiac Arrest:** This can be a complication in critically ill patients, especially with severe infections and pre-existing heart conditions.

If you have concerns about the timing of diagnosis or care, you may consider requesting a detailed medical review or second opinion from another specialist or hospital. They can evaluate the medical records, test results, and treatment timeline to clarify if there was any delay or oversight.

In summary, fungal pneumonia is serious and can be difficult to diagnose early. The progression and complications your father experienced are unfortunately possible in such cases.","The most likely diagnosis is **fungal pneumonia leading to severe respiratory failure** in a patient with significant comorbidities (diabetes and coronary artery disease with stents).

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Initial bacterial pneumonia treated in ICU, followed by apparent recovery.
- Recurrence of severe shortness of breath about a month later, requiring ICU admission and ventilator support.
- Fungal pneumonia confirmed by cultures reported on July 9.
- Patient’s immunocompromised state (due to diabetes and prior critical illness) increases susceptibility to fungal infections.
- Fungal pneumonia is indeed serious and often requires ICU-level care, especially if respiratory failure develops.
- Delay in fungal culture results is common due to slow fungal growth; however, clinical suspicion and early empirical antifungal therapy might have been warranted given the patient’s risk factors and clinical deterioration.

In summary, the diagnosis is **severe fungal pneumonia causing respiratory failure**, which is a serious condition necessitating ICU care. Earlier diagnosis is challenging but could potentially be improved with heightened clinical suspicion and earlier fungal-specific testing or empirical treatment in high-risk patients.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor.

Earlier diagnosis is challenging but could potentially be improved with heightened clinical suspicion and earlier fungal-specific testing or empirical treatment in high-risk patients.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"As a diabetic with mildly high sugar (usually in the range of 99-105 before meals, 110 two hours after meal) I have discouvered that AFTER eating a candy bar, or some other sugar laden product like cake or pie, that my sugar lever actually goes DOWN, to around 80 - 90, and will remain so until my next meal. Why is that???","It's unusual but not impossible for blood sugar to drop after eating sugary foods. Possible explanations include:

1. **Reactive Hypoglycemia:** Some people experience a rapid insulin release after consuming high-sugar foods, causing blood sugar to initially spike then drop below fasting levels.

2. **Measurement Timing:** If you measure your blood sugar too long after eating, the initial rise may have passed, and insulin action may have lowered your glucose.

3. **Counter-Regulatory Hormones:** In some cases, the body may overcompensate with insulin or other hormones, leading to a temporary dip.

4. **Medication Effects:** If you take diabetes medications or insulin, timing and dose can influence post-meal glucose levels.

5. **Laboratory or Meter Variability:** Occasional inaccuracies in glucose meters can cause unexpected readings.

Because this pattern is atypical, especially for a diabetic, it’s important to discuss these findings with your healthcare provider. They may recommend continuous glucose monitoring or further testing to understand your glucose patterns and adjust your management plan safely.","In a diabetic patient, it is unusual for blood glucose levels to decrease after consuming sugar-rich foods. The reported pattern—mildly elevated fasting and postprandial glucose levels, but a drop in glucose after intake of candy bars or sugary foods—suggests an atypical glucose response.

**Most likely diagnosis: Reactive (postprandial) hypoglycemia or an exaggerated insulin response.**

Explanation:
- The patient’s baseline glucose is mildly elevated, consistent with diabetes or prediabetes.
- After sugar intake, instead of glucose rising, it falls, indicating an excessive insulin release causing hypoglycemia.
- This can occur in early type 2 diabetes or in conditions with increased insulin sensitivity or hyperinsulinemia.
- Another possibility is an insulinoma or other causes of endogenous hyperinsulinemia, but this is less common.

**Next steps:**
- Perform a detailed glucose and insulin curve after a standardized glucose load.
- Evaluate for reactive hypoglycemia.
- Review medications and dietary habits.
- Consider endocrinology referral if hypoglycemia is confirmed.

so for birth control im on the shot. after 3 months i was suppose to get another shot but i never went. so i got my period and i figured by me missing the next shot that caused me to get it. i had my period for like a few weeks. then it went away for a few days. i had unprotected sex and the next day i got my period again. even when i dont have my period im constantly bleeding like brown stuff. i dont think i could be pregnant but im just not too sure. or if im having all of this happen due to the fact that i missed my next birth control shot. can you help me figure out what could be wronge please ????,"Missing your scheduled birth control shot can cause hormonal fluctuations that lead to irregular bleeding, spotting (brown discharge), and breakthrough bleeding. The prolonged bleeding and spotting you're experiencing are likely due to the missed injection disrupting your hormone levels.

Having unprotected sex during this time does carry a risk of pregnancy, especially since the contraceptive protection decreases after the 3-month window without the next shot. Although you had bleeding, it may not be a true period but breakthrough bleeding, so pregnancy cannot be ruled out without testing.

What you should do:
1. Take a home pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy.
2. Schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss restarting contraception and managing the irregular bleeding.
3. Avoid unprotected sex until you have confirmed contraception and pregnancy status.

If you experience heavy bleeding, severe pain, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.","The patient's symptoms—prolonged menstrual bleeding, breakthrough bleeding (brown spotting), and irregular bleeding episodes after missing the scheduled Depo-Provera injection—are consistent with **breakthrough bleeding and irregular spotting due to loss of contraceptive hormone coverage**.

**Explanation:**
- Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) injections are given every 3 months to maintain steady progestin levels that suppress ovulation and stabilize the endometrium.
- Missing the injection leads to a drop in hormone levels, causing the endometrium to become unstable and shed irregularly, resulting in prolonged and irregular bleeding.
- The bleeding pattern described (prolonged bleeding, spotting, and bleeding after intercourse) is typical of hormonal withdrawal and endometrial instability.
- Pregnancy is possible but less likely if the patient missed only one injection and had unprotected intercourse during the bleeding-free interval; however, pregnancy should be ruled out with a pregnancy test.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Breakthrough bleeding and irregular spotting due to missed Depo-Provera injection (hormonal withdrawal bleeding).**

**Recommended next steps:**  
- Perform a pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy.  
- Resume Depo-Provera injections as soon as possible if pregnancy is excluded.  
- If bleeding persists or worsens, further evaluation may be needed to rule out other causes (e.g., infection, endometrial pathology).","Hello, and I hope I can help you today. First, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. If your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months.  This, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant.  If you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills.  Birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time).  Many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. So, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the Demo shot.  If you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,","A patient on Depo-Provera birth control shot missed the scheduled injection at 3 months.

I am 86 years old and having good health till 4 months back. I got psoriatic Arthratis but it was diagonised late. I lost 4 months and got treated by the doctor with Saaz. But I found it not suitable for me. I lost 2 month for treatment. Now I have been treated with folitrax 15 mg injection and I found it is ok for me. Pl advise how to get strength as I am bed ridden and could not walk properly without support. Also my back joints L4 L5 etc are giving lot of pain. Pl advise remedy.,"Thank you for sharing your situation. Psoriatic arthritis and spinal issues like L4-L5 involvement can cause significant pain and weakness, especially in older adults. Here are some recommendations to help improve your strength and manage pain:

1. **Medication and Pain Management:**
   - Continue your prescribed Folitrax (likely methotrexate) as directed by your doctor.
   - For back pain, discuss with your doctor about safe pain relief options such as NSAIDs or other analgesics suitable for your age and health.
   - Consider physical therapy referral for targeted pain management and mobility improvement.

2. **Physical Therapy and Exercise:**
   - Gentle, supervised physical therapy can help maintain joint mobility, reduce stiffness, and improve muscle strength.
   - Even simple bed exercises or assisted movements can prevent muscle wasting.
   - Gradual weight-bearing activities as tolerated can help regain walking ability.

3. **Nutrition:**
   - Ensure a balanced diet rich in protein, vitamins (especially Vitamin D and calcium), and minerals to support muscle and bone health.
   - Stay hydrated.

4. **Pain Relief Measures:**
   - Use heat or cold packs on painful joints to reduce pain and stiffness.
   - Maintain good posture and use supportive cushions or mattresses to reduce back strain.

5. **Assistive Devices:**
   - Use walking aids like a walker or cane as recommended to improve safety and mobility.

6. **Regular Follow-up:**
   - Regularly consult your rheumatologist and possibly a pain specialist or orthopedic doctor for ongoing management.
   - Imaging or further evaluation of your spine may be needed if pain persists or worsens.

**Important:** Avoid self-medicating or starting new treatments without medical advice. Since you are elderly and have complex issues, a multidisciplinary approach including rheumatology, physical therapy, and possibly pain management is best.

If you experience new symptoms like numbness, weakness, or bladder/bowel issues, seek immediate medical attention.

Would you like guidance on specific exercises or nutritional plans?","In an elderly patient with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who develops severe back pain localized to the L4-L5 joints and significant mobility impairment, the most likely diagnosis is **axial involvement of psoriatic arthritis**, specifically **psoriatic spondylitis** or **inflammatory sacroiliitis/vertebral joint involvement**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Psoriatic arthritis can involve the axial skeleton, causing inflammation of the sacroiliac joints and vertebral joints (spondylitis).
- Severe back pain and difficulty walking suggest active inflammation and possible structural damage.
- The L4-L5 involvement indicates lumbar spine inflammation, common in axial PsA.
- The patient’s symptoms are consistent with inflammatory back pain rather than mechanical causes.

Other considerations:
- Infection or fracture should be ruled out, especially in elderly bedridden patients.
- Imaging (MRI of the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints) is essential to confirm inflammation and exclude other causes.

He is taking augmentin 625, bricarex A and duolin inhaler and recofast plus.now the fever is less but cough and pain and wheezing is still same.mucus is not coming out. Thanks.","The prominent bronchovascular markings in both lower lung zones on the X-ray suggest inflammation or irritation of the airways, which can be seen in conditions like bronchitis or asthma exacerbation. Given your husband's symptoms—fever, asthmatic cough, chest pain on coughing, wheezing, and congestion—this likely represents an ongoing airway inflammation or infection.

He is on appropriate medications including antibiotics (Augmentin), bronchodilators (Duolin inhaler), and supportive treatments. The reduction in fever is a good sign, but persistent cough, chest pain, and wheezing indicate that the airway inflammation is still active.

Recommendations:
- Continue the prescribed medications as directed.
- Use the inhaler regularly to relieve bronchospasm.
- Stay well hydrated to help loosen mucus.
- If mucus is not coming out and symptoms persist or worsen (increased breathlessness, high fever, chest pain, or coughing up blood), seek medical attention promptly.
- Follow-up with his doctor for reassessment, as he may need further evaluation or adjustment of treatment.

If symptoms are severe or worsening, do not delay in seeking emergency care.","The patient's presentation includes fever, asthmatic cough, chest pain on coughing, congestion, and wheezing, with chest X-ray showing prominent bronchovascular markings mainly in the lower lung zones but no consolidation or infiltrates. Treatment with Augmentin (an antibiotic), bronchodilators (Duolin inhaler), and other supportive meds has reduced fever but cough, chest pain, and wheezing persist without sputum production.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Acute bronchitis with underlying reactive airway (asthmatic) component**

**Rationale:**  
- Fever and cough with wheezing suggest airway inflammation.  
- Prominent bronchovascular markings on X-ray without infiltrates are typical of bronchitis rather than pneumonia.  
- Persistent wheezing and cough without sputum point to airway hyperreactivity, common in asthmatic bronchitis or viral bronchitis exacerbating asthma.  
- Improvement of fever with antibiotics suggests possible bacterial superinfection, but persistent symptoms indicate ongoing airway inflammation rather than pneumonia.

**Summary:**  
The clinical picture and imaging are consistent with acute bronchitis superimposed on asthma/reactive airway disease. Continued bronchodilator therapy and symptomatic management are appropriate.

"my boobs have gradually been getting bigger, i was at one point extremely nauseous,dizzy when i stand up & my period has been abnormal for the past 2 months my period has only lasted for a day & my periods are always on time and always last for 3-4 days.(my family is known to have their periods during their early pregnancy) me and my boyfriend are sexually active so pregnancy is always a possibility. I am on birth control & have been for 3 years now. but i often forget to take it. I ve missed 3 days in a row before. well i was in Ohio and since me and my bf wouldn t be together for a few days and i was getting close to the inactive pills i went off of them to see if i would start early or at least spot. when i miss 2 days of my BC i either spot lightly or start my period. well i went off my BC on Wednesday of last week. so i haven t had a pill in a week & still no period. i tested last month & the test came up negative. so am i pregnant &/or should i be worried??","Given your symptoms—breast enlargement, nausea, dizziness on standing, and abnormal periods—along with missed birth control pills and being sexually active, pregnancy is a possibility despite a negative test last month. Missing multiple birth control pills and stopping them can cause irregular bleeding and delay your period, but pregnancy should be ruled out.

**What you should do:**
1. Take a home pregnancy test now, ideally with the first morning urine, to check for pregnancy.
2. If the test is negative and your period does not start within a week, or if symptoms worsen, see a healthcare provider for further evaluation.
3. If you experience severe dizziness, fainting, or heavy bleeding, seek medical attention promptly.

In summary, pregnancy is possible, so retest now and consult your doctor for confirmation and guidance.","Key points from the history:
- Sexually active female on birth control pills for 3 years.
- Often forgets pills, recently missed 3 consecutive days.
- Symptoms: gradual breast enlargement, episodes of extreme nausea, dizziness on standing.
- Menstrual changes: shorter periods (1 day vs. usual 3-4 days) over 2 months.
- Stopped birth control a week ago to induce withdrawal bleeding, but no period yet.
- Negative pregnancy test last month.
- Family history of menstruation during early pregnancy.

**Analysis:**

1. **Missed pills and pregnancy risk:** Missing 3 consecutive days of combined oral contraceptives significantly increases the risk of ovulation and pregnancy.

2. **Symptoms of pregnancy:** Breast enlargement, nausea (morning sickness), and dizziness (possibly due to orthostatic hypotension or anemia) are common early pregnancy symptoms.

3. **Menstrual changes:** Shortened and irregular periods can occur in early pregnancy or due to hormonal fluctuations after missed pills.

4. **No withdrawal bleeding after stopping pills:** Suggests endogenous hormonal activity, possibly from pregnancy.

5. **Negative pregnancy test last month:** If the test was done early, it might have been a false negative or pregnancy occurred after the test.

6. **Family history of menstruation during early pregnancy:** Some women experience implantation bleeding or spotting that can be mistaken for menstruation.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Early pregnancy despite previous negative test, complicated by missed birth control pills.**

**Recommended next steps:**  
- Repeat a sensitive urine or serum beta-hCG pregnancy test now.  
- Pelvic ultrasound if pregnancy test positive or if diagnosis unclear.  
- Evaluate for other causes if pregnancy is ruled out.

"Dear Doc,My Uric acid levels have gone up as a result my blood pressure. Uric acid is at 6.8 and BP 140/100. Otherwise I am fit and work out like crazy. I have been working out intensively for the past 1 month. I take Nexpro RD20. Olvance 20 and atorec 10 everyday. I am 38 yrs of age. The nexpro is because i had h-pilori which has now been taken care of. Kindly advise. I do not eat red meats and take alcohol 2 pegs twice a week.","Your uric acid level of 6.8 mg/dL is slightly elevated (normal range is generally up to 6.0 mg/dL for women and 7.0 mg/dL for men), and your blood pressure reading of 140/100 mmHg indicates stage 2 hypertension, which needs attention.

Key points and advice:

1. **Uric Acid and Blood Pressure:** Elevated uric acid can contribute to high blood pressure and vice versa. Intensive workouts can sometimes increase uric acid temporarily due to muscle breakdown.

2. **Medications:**  
   - Nexpro RD20 (likely a proton pump inhibitor) is for your past H. pylori infection.  
   - Olvance 20 (likely Olmesartan) is an antihypertensive.  
   - Atorec 10 (Atorvastatin) is for cholesterol management.

3. **Lifestyle:**  
   - You avoid red meat and limit alcohol, which is good.  
   - Intensive workouts are beneficial but ensure adequate hydration and avoid overtraining, which can raise uric acid transiently.

4. **Recommendations:**  
   - Monitor your blood pressure regularly; 140/100 is high and may require medication adjustment. Consult your doctor about your current antihypertensive dose.  
   - Repeat uric acid test after a few weeks of hydration and possibly moderating workout intensity to see if levels normalize.  
   - Maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy; avoid high-purine foods like organ meats, shellfish, and excessive fructose.  
   - Limit alcohol further if possible, as it can raise uric acid and blood pressure.  
   - Discuss with your physician whether uric acid-lowering therapy is needed.  
   - Continue managing cholesterol as advised.

If you experience joint pain, swelling, or worsening blood pressure, seek medical attention promptly. Regular follow-up with your healthcare provider is important to optimize your treatment.","Key points from the case:
- Age: 38 years
- History: Helicobacter pylori infection (currently treated)
- Elevated uric acid: 6.8 mg/dL (upper limit of normal or mildly elevated)
- Blood pressure: 140/100 mmHg (hypertension, stage 2)
- Intensive exercise for past month
- Medications: Nexpro RD20 (esomeprazole, a PPI), Olvance 20 (olmesartan, an ARB), Atorec 10 (atorvastatin)
- Denies red meat, occasional alcohol

Interpretation:
- The patient has hypertension (140/100 mmHg).
- Uric acid is mildly elevated but not in the range typically diagnostic of gout (>7 mg/dL in men).
- Intensive exercise can transiently increase uric acid due to increased purine metabolism.
- Olmesartan (Olvance) is an ARB, which can lower uric acid levels, so the mild elevation is less likely due to medication.
- Atorvastatin does not typically raise uric acid.
- Nexpro (esomeprazole) is unlikely to affect uric acid significantly.
- No other risk factors for secondary hyperuricemia (no diuretics, no heavy alcohol, no red meat).
- Hypertension and mild hyperuricemia together suggest possible early metabolic syndrome or essential hypertension with mild hyperuricemia.

Most likely diagnosis:
- Essential hypertension with mild hyperuricemia, possibly related to lifestyle factors (intensive exercise) and early metabolic changes.

No evidence of gout or secondary causes of hyperuricemia.

Recommendation:
- Monitor blood pressure and uric acid.
- Lifestyle modification (diet, exercise).
- Continue current antihypertensive and statin therapy.
- Reassess uric acid after cessation or reduction of intensive exercise.

"Hi doctor, My dad was diagnosed with HCC and is at stage 4 now. He has stopped nexavar since it stops working for him. He s on Tarceva . He has mestasized as well. He has ascites and swollen feet for over 2 weeks now. He often gets severe stomach pain at night around his abdominal area. The pain is not confined to the right side but over the whole area of the stomach. Do you speculate its the ascites pain and not the cancer pain? Although he was given diuretics but didnt quite help. Do you recommend him for fluid suction? What other advice do you have for him? His doctor told him to restrict his protein intake but he s not compliant. Just las few days, he s been having periodic upper body numbness which goes away after 5 minutes. Any idea what s happening here?? thanks","I'm sorry to hear about your dad's condition. Given his advanced HCC with metastasis, ascites, and symptoms, here are some considerations:

1. **Abdominal Pain:**  
   - The diffuse abdominal pain could be due to ascites causing stretching of the peritoneum, but cancer-related pain (tumor invasion, metastases) can also cause widespread discomfort.  
   - Ascites-related pain often worsens with increased fluid accumulation and can be relieved somewhat by fluid drainage.

2. **Ascites and Swollen Feet:**  
   - Persistent ascites despite diuretics suggests refractory ascites.  
   - Therapeutic paracentesis (fluid suction) is often recommended to relieve symptoms and improve comfort. This can be done safely and repeatedly if needed.  
   - Salt restriction and adherence to diuretics are important to manage fluid retention.

3. **Protein Restriction:**  
   - Protein restriction is sometimes advised in liver failure to reduce hepatic encephalopathy risk, but malnutrition is a concern. Compliance is important but should be balanced with nutritional needs. A dietitian's input can help.

4. **Upper Body Numbness:**  
   - Transient numbness lasting minutes could be due to electrolyte imbalances (common in liver disease), medication side effects, or neurological issues such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).  
   - This symptom warrants urgent evaluation by his healthcare provider to rule out serious causes.

**Recommendations:**  
- Discuss with his oncologist or hepatologist about therapeutic paracentesis to relieve ascites.  
- Ensure strict adherence to diuretics, salt restriction, and dietary advice.  
- Monitor for signs of infection, worsening encephalopathy, or other complications.  
- The numbness episodes should be promptly evaluated—consider blood tests (electrolytes, liver function), neurological assessment, and possibly imaging.  
- Pain management should be optimized, possibly with palliative care involvement.

Please ensure he follows up urgently with his healthcare team to address these symptoms and adjust his care plan accordingly.","Key clinical points:
- Elderly male with stage 4 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastases.
- Discontinued Nexavar (sorafenib) due to loss of efficacy; currently on Tarceva (erlotinib).
- Ascites and bilateral lower extremity edema >2 weeks, refractory to diuretics.
- Severe nocturnal diffuse abdominal pain.
- Advised protein restriction but noncompliant.
- New intermittent episodes of upper body numbness lasting ~5 minutes, resolving spontaneously.

---

**Analysis:**

1. **Advanced HCC with ascites and edema:**  
   Ascites and edema in advanced HCC are common due to portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and liver failure.

2. **Refractory ascites despite diuretics:**  
   Suggests worsening liver function or complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or peritoneal carcinomatosis.

3. **Severe nocturnal diffuse abdominal pain:**  
   Could be due to peritoneal irritation, ischemia, or tumor infiltration.

4. **Protein restriction noncompliance:**  
   In liver failure, protein restriction is advised to prevent hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

5. **Intermittent upper body numbness lasting ~5 minutes:**  
   Transient neurological symptoms in a patient with advanced liver disease and cancer raise concern for metabolic encephalopathy or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).

---

**Most likely diagnosis:**

- The **intermittent upper body numbness** episodes are likely **transient neurological symptoms due to hepatic encephalopathy (HE)** or metabolic disturbances (e.g., electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia) secondary to liver failure.

- The **persistent ascites and abdominal pain** suggest worsening liver failure and possible complications such as SBP or peritoneal carcinomatosis.

- Given the noncompliance with protein restriction, **hepatic encephalopathy** is a strong possibility causing transient neurological symptoms.

---

**Summary:**

The most likely diagnosis is **hepatic encephalopathy causing transient neurological symptoms (intermittent upper body numbness), in the setting of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with refractory ascites and worsening liver failure**.

---

**Recommendations:**

- Evaluate for hepatic encephalopathy: check ammonia levels, electrolytes, liver function tests.
- Assess for SBP: diagnostic paracentesis with ascitic fluid analysis.
- Optimize management of ascites and encephalopathy (lactulose, rifaximin).
- Neurological evaluation to rule out other causes (stroke, TIA) if indicated.

"I had a heart attack due to a 100% over six hours in December; before that I was athletic and in great shape. However, after the heart attack my EF went down to 47... that said my doctor put me on a beta blocker and ace inhibitor. (also blood-thinners and a statin) I exercise heavy 4-5 days a week, and am active for 7 days a week; I eat well, fish at least 5 times a week, all else is vegetables and sometimes chicken; and drink moderately. Today I had another Echocardiogram and suck a peek at the screen before I left. It looked like my LVEF was at 31%. How is it possible that this went down? Am I doing something wrong? What else should I do? Is it safe to fly for business?","I'm sorry to hear about your situation. A drop in LVEF from 47% to 31% after a heart attack can occur due to several reasons:

1. **Progressive heart muscle damage:** The initial heart attack may have caused ongoing remodeling or scarring, leading to worsening heart function.
2. **Ischemia or new blockages:** There could be new or unresolved coronary artery issues causing further damage.
3. **Heart failure progression:** Despite good lifestyle and medications, some patients experience worsening heart failure.
4. **Measurement variability:** Echocardiogram LVEF estimates can vary between tests and operators, but a drop this significant usually reflects real change.

Given your history and current findings, here are important steps:

- **Follow up urgently with your cardiologist:** They may want to repeat imaging, consider additional tests (like stress testing, cardiac MRI, or coronary angiography), and optimize your medications.
- **Medication adherence:** Continue beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and blood thinners as prescribed.
- **Monitor symptoms:** Report any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling, or fatigue immediately.
- **Exercise:** Moderate exercise is generally beneficial, but heavy exercise may need adjustment based on your current heart function.
- **Diet and lifestyle:** Continue your heart-healthy diet and moderate alcohol intake.
- **Flying:** With reduced EF and recent heart issues, flying can increase risk of complications like blood clots or worsening heart failure. Discuss with your cardiologist before travel; they may recommend precautions or delay flying.

In summary, a drop in EF is concerning and warrants prompt medical evaluation to identify causes and adjust treatment. Do not delay contacting your healthcare provider.","The most likely diagnosis is **progressive ischemic cardiomyopathy with worsening left ventricular systolic dysfunction** following the prior myocardial infarction.

Explanation:
- The patient had a significant MI with 100% occlusion and an initial moderately reduced LVEF (47%).
- Despite optimal medical therapy (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, antithrombotics, statins) and a healthy lifestyle, the LVEF has declined further to 31%.
- This progressive decline suggests ongoing adverse remodeling and deterioration of myocardial function post-infarction.
- The clinical picture is consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Further evaluation and management should focus on optimizing heart failure therapy, assessing for viable myocardium or ischemia, and considering device therapy if indicated.","Hello there. You said that you suffered from heart attack due to 100% blockage of artery. After a myocardial infarction the blood supply to a part of the muscle whose artery is blocked does not receive blood. As a result that muscle tissue dies and can't pump blood. As a result the ejection fraction starts falling. It is good that you maintain a healthy and active lifestyle, but I would suggest you to avoid heavy strenuous work like running and picking heavy weights as it will increase further load on your heart.

The patient was prescribed beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, blood thinners, and statins. The patient maintains heavy exercise 4-5 days weekly, is active daily, consumes a diet rich in fish and vegetables with moderate alcohol intake. A recent echocardiogram indicated a further decline in LVEF to 31%. What is the most likely diagnosis?",model_response_og,model_response_conv,doctor_output,"I'm sorry to hear about your situation. A drop in LVEF from 47% to 31% after a heart attack can occur due to several reasons:

1. **Progressive heart muscle damage:** The initial heart attack may have caused ongoing remodeling or scarring, leading to worsening heart function.
2. **Ischemia or new blockages:** There could be new or unresolved coronary artery issues causing further damage.
3. **Heart failure progression:** Despite good lifestyle and medications, some patients experience worsening heart failure.
4. **Measurement variability:** Echocardiogram LVEF estimates can vary between tests and operators, but a drop this significant usually reflects real change.

Given your history and current findings, here are important steps:

- **Follow up urgently with your cardiologist:** They may want to repeat imaging, consider additional tests (like stress testing, cardiac MRI, or coronary angiography), and optimize your medications.
- **Medication adherence:** Continue beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and blood thinners as prescribed.
- **Monitor symptoms:** Report any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling, or fatigue immediately.
- **Exercise:** Moderate exercise is generally beneficial, but heavy exercise may need adjustment based on your current heart function.
- **Diet and lifestyle:** Continue your heart-healthy diet and moderate alcohol intake.
- **Flying:** With reduced EF and recent heart issues, flying can increase risk of complications like blood clots or worsening heart failure. Discuss with your cardiologist before travel; they may recommend precautions or delay flying.

In summary, a drop in EF is concerning and warrants prompt medical evaluation to identify causes and adjust treatment. Do not delay contacting your healthcare provider.","The most likely diagnosis is **progressive ischemic cardiomyopathy with worsening left ventricular systolic dysfunction** following the prior myocardial infarction.

Explanation:
- The patient had a significant MI with 100% occlusion and an initial moderately reduced LVEF (47%).
- Despite optimal medical therapy (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, antithrombotics, statins) and a healthy lifestyle, the LVEF has declined further to 31%.
- This progressive decline suggests ongoing adverse remodeling and deterioration of myocardial function post-infarction.
- The clinical picture is consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Further evaluation and management should focus on optimizing heart failure therapy, assessing for viable myocardium or ischemia, and considering device therapy if indicated.","Hello there. You said that you suffered from heart attack due to 100% blockage of artery. After a myocardial infarction the blood supply to a part of the muscle whose artery is blocked does not receive blood. As a result that muscle tissue dies and can't pump blood. As a result the ejection fraction starts falling. It is good that you maintain a healthy and active lifestyle, but I would suggest you to avoid heavy strenuous work like running and picking heavy weights as it will increase further load on your heart. You can do brisk walking instead. However, it is safe for you to fly if your blood pressure is under control. I hope that answers your question.

"I am a firefighter, and i know it puts a lot of strain on joints. However over the last month or so I have noticed my the inner most side of my elbow (if extended) appears slightly swollen, kinda ""squishy"", and is tender to touch as if it was a bruise. However it has not changed.I have also noticed a ""knot"" on the top of my shoulder that is tender to touch and that my should cracks a lot more, and ""pop"" in a lot more places then before.","Your symptoms suggest possible inflammation or irritation in the elbow and shoulder areas, which could be related to repetitive strain or overuse common in firefighting. 

- The swelling and tenderness on the inner side of your elbow may indicate **medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow)**, bursitis, or a mild soft tissue injury.
- The ""knot"" on your shoulder and increased cracking/popping sounds could be due to **muscle tightness, tendon irritation, or early signs of shoulder impingement or bursitis**.

Given the persistence of symptoms and your physically demanding job, I recommend:

1. Resting the affected areas as much as possible.
2. Applying ice to reduce swelling.
3. Using over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications if no contraindications.
4. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises once pain decreases.
5. Seeking evaluation by a healthcare professional or orthopedic specialist for a thorough physical exam and possibly imaging (ultrasound or MRI) to rule out tendon tears, bursitis, or other structural issues.

Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent worsening and help you return to duty safely. If you experience increasing pain, numbness, weakness, or loss of function, seek medical attention promptly.","The patient's symptoms include:

- Slight swelling and tenderness on the inner side of the elbow, described as squishy and bruise-like, stable over one month.
- A tender palpable knot on the top of the shoulder.
- Increased shoulder crepitus with multiple popping sounds.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

1. **Elbow:** The inner elbow swelling and tenderness, described as squishy and bruise-like, stable over time, suggests a **chronic olecranon bursitis** or possibly a soft tissue cyst (e.g., ganglion cyst). The lack of progression and the ""bruise-like"" quality make acute infection or trauma less likely.

2. **Shoulder:** A tender palpable knot on the top of the shoulder with crepitus and popping sounds is characteristic of **subacromial bursitis** or **rotator cuff tendinopathy/tear** with associated bursal inflammation. The palpable knot could be a thickened bursa or a calcific deposit.

**Summary:**  
- Inner elbow: Chronic olecranon bursitis (non-infectious)  
- Shoulder: Subacromial bursitis or rotator cuff tendinopathy with crepitus

**Recommendation:**  
Clinical examination and imaging (ultrasound or MRI) can confirm bursitis or tendon pathology. Conservative management with rest, NSAIDs, and physical therapy is first-line. If bursitis is large or persistent, aspiration or corticosteroid injection may be considered.

My semen test analysis is like this: Physical examination: Abstinance : 3 days Quanity: 0.5ml Color : Whitish Viscocity: Normal Odour: SEMINAL Reaction :Alkaline Liquification time: 30 min Microscopic Examination : Sperm count : 190mill/ml Motility a) Active Motile : 35% b) Sluggish Motile: 10% c) Non Motile: 55% Morphology : Norml forms: 40% Abnormal Forms: 60% Pus cells: 12-14/HPF EPITHELIAL CELLS: 2-3/HPF RBC : 10-12/HPF In RBS Test, Random Glucose level : 119 It s being a big impact on my lifestyle.Hence,Can u plz suggest the detailed information & problems based on my report.Is there any abnormality? what could be the medication and treatment. Thanks. Rithwik","Hello Rithwik,

Thank you for sharing your semen analysis and RBS results. Here's an interpretation and advice based on your report:

### Semen Analysis Interpretation:
- **Quantity:** 0.5 ml (Low; normal volume is typically 1.5 ml or more)
- **Sperm Count:** 190 million/ml (Normal; WHO reference is ≥15 million/ml)
- **Motility:** Active motile 35% (Normal is ≥40% total motility, your active motility is slightly low)
- **Morphology:** 40% normal forms (This is good; normal forms are usually >4% by strict criteria)
- **Pus cells:** 12-14/HPF (Elevated; indicates possible infection or inflammation)
- **RBC:** 10-12/HPF (Presence of red blood cells is abnormal and suggests inflammation or trauma)
- **Liquefaction time:** 30 min (Normal is within 60 min)

### RBS (Random Blood Sugar):
- 119 mg/dL (This is in the prediabetes range; normal is <140 mg/dL random, but fasting and HbA1c are better indicators)

---

### Summary of Findings:
1. **Low semen volume:** Could be due to incomplete ejaculation, infection, or obstruction.
2. **Good sperm count and morphology:** Positive sign for fertility.
3. **Slightly reduced motility:** May affect fertility but not severely.
4. **Presence of pus cells and RBCs:** Suggests infection or inflammation in the reproductive tract (e.g., prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis).
5. **Elevated blood sugar:** Prediabetic state, which can affect overall health and fertility.

---

### Recommendations:
1. **Consult a Urologist or Andrologist:** To evaluate and treat possible infection/inflammation. They may prescribe antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications after further tests (e.g., culture, ultrasound).
2. **Repeat Semen Analysis after Treatment:** To check improvement post-infection treatment.
3. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Control blood sugar through diet, exercise, and possibly medication as advised by an endocrinologist.
4. **Further Fertility Evaluation:** Your partner should also be evaluated to rule out female factors.
5. **Avoid smoking, alcohol, and heat exposure:** These can affect sperm quality.

---

### Medications and Treatment:
- Do not start antibiotics or other medications without a doctor's prescription.
- If infection is confirmed, a course of antibiotics will be given.
- Supplements like antioxidants (vitamins C, E, zinc) may help improve sperm quality but consult your doctor first.

---

### Final Note:
Your semen parameters are mostly good except for low volume and signs of infection. Treating the infection and managing blood sugar are key steps. Please see a specialist for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan.

If you need, I can help you prepare questions for your doctor or explain further tests.

Wishing you good health and success in your family planning!","Let's analyze the findings step-by-step:

1. **History:** 1.5 years of marriage with unsuccessful conception (infertility).

2. **Semen analysis:**
   - Volume: 0.5 ml (normal is typically 1.5-5 ml) → Low volume (hypospermia).
   - Color: Whitish (normal).
   - Viscosity: Normal.
   - pH: Alkaline (normal is 7.2-8.0).
   - Liquefaction time: 30 minutes (normal is within 20-30 minutes).
   - Sperm count: 190 million/ml (normal >15 million/ml) → High normal.
   - Motility: 35% active motile, 10% sluggish, 55% non-motile (normal progressive motility >40%) → Slightly reduced motility.
   - Morphology: 40% normal forms (normal >4%) → Normal morphology.
   - Pus cells: 12-14/HPF (normal <1-2) → Significant leukocytospermia, indicating infection or inflammation.
   - Epithelial cells: 2-3/HPF (can be normal).
   - RBCs: 10-12/HPF (should be absent) → Presence of red blood cells indicates possible inflammation or trauma.

3. **Random blood sugar:** 119 mg/dL (normal fasting <100 mg/dL, random <140 mg/dL) → Normal or borderline.

**Interpretation:**

- The semen volume is low, which may suggest obstruction or ejaculatory duct obstruction.
- High sperm count with low volume and presence of RBCs and pus cells suggests infection/inflammation.
- Leukocytospermia and RBCs indicate seminal tract infection or inflammation.
- Motility is slightly reduced but morphology is good.
- Normal blood sugar excludes diabetes-related infertility.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

- **Infective or inflammatory cause of male infertility with low semen volume (possibly partial ejaculatory duct obstruction or seminal vesiculitis).**

Given the presence of pus cells and RBCs, the diagnosis is **seminal vesiculitis or prostatitis causing low volume semen with leukocytospermia and hematospermia leading to infertility.**

"i have had what i believe are enlarged papillae on the sides of my tongue for about a month now, they come and go and switch sides often. it feels like i have a popcorn kernel stuck to that particular place each time it happens. ive looked inside my mouth several times and found nothing but a slightly swollen papillae (always on the sides, never in the center of my tongue). i am a 25 year old female and i do smoke , but the bumps did not start appearing until i began to try to quit smoking about a month ago. i also have hypertension and take metoprolol tartrate 50mg 2x daily to control my blood pressure which has been good. i try to stay hydrated but i also drink a lot of sodas. any ideas? i have had the current bump for 5 days, it isn t painful, just bothersome.","Your symptoms of intermittent, slightly swollen papillae on the sides of your tongue that come and go, feeling like a popcorn kernel stuck, are most consistent with transient irritation or inflammation of the fungiform papillae. This can be caused by several factors:

- **Smoking cessation:** Changes in oral environment and nerve sensitivity after quitting smoking can cause transient tongue changes.
- **Irritants:** Frequent soda consumption (acidic and sugary) can irritate the tongue.
- **Mechanical irritation:** Tongue biting or friction from teeth.
- **Medication:** Metoprolol rarely causes oral side effects, but it’s less likely here.
- **Hydration:** You mention trying to stay hydrated, which is good.

Yesterday afternoon, around 5pm I had a double shot expresso machiatto from starbucks and it kept me up last night. My heart felt like it was skipping beats every minute or so...and then I got anxious and felt like it got more frequent. I fell asleep at say 1:30am and felt ok this morning. I don t sleep well, stressed at work and drink a lot of coffee late at night sometimes. I tried to have small cup today and the same thing started happening to my heart. Do I need to cut out caffeine I guess? I feel ok now, after drinking a lot of water and it s not happening as often now.","Your symptoms of heart ""skipping beats"" (palpitations) after caffeine intake, especially espresso, are likely related to the stimulant effects of caffeine, which can trigger palpitations and increase anxiety. Given your anxiety history and irregular Lexapro use, caffeine can exacerbate both anxiety and heart palpitations.

Recommendations:
1. **Cut back or avoid caffeine**, especially in the late afternoon and evening, to see if symptoms improve.
2. **Try to take your Lexapro consistently** as prescribed, since irregular use can worsen anxiety symptoms.
3. **Manage stress and improve sleep hygiene** to reduce anxiety and palpitations.
4. If palpitations persist, worsen, or are accompanied by dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath, seek medical evaluation promptly.

If symptoms continue despite lifestyle changes, a cardiac evaluation (like ECG or Holter monitor) may be needed to rule out arrhythmias. But for now, reducing caffeine and managing anxiety are key steps.","The most likely diagnosis is **caffeine-induced palpitations (caffeine-related cardiac arrhythmia)**, exacerbated by underlying anxiety.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Palpitations occur shortly after caffeine intake (espresso macchiato).
- Symptoms worsen with anxiety, which can increase sympathetic tone.
- Palpitations disrupt sleep and are reproducible with caffeine.
- Resolution with hydration suggests transient stimulant effect rather than structural heart disease.
- No family history of premature cardiac disease reduces likelihood of inherited arrhythmias.

Management should focus on reducing caffeine intake, improving sleep hygiene, and optimizing anxiety treatment adherence. If palpitations persist or worsen, further cardiac evaluation (e.g., ECG, Holter monitor) may be warranted.","Hi, caffeine itself is known to increase the heart rate, blood pressure and so for sure cutting on your caffeine will help you to avoid such episode and get good sleep.  Many a time because of our anxious nature there is subjective feeling of palpitations when our heart rate increases transiently, (which is a normal phenomenon), however which triggers a cycle whereby the brain register s the normal beating too as palpation because our mind become s more receptacle.  So try cutting such cycles short by Not thinking much. Regards Chat Doctor. ","A 37-year-old patient with a history of anxiety managed with Lexapro, though medication adherence is inconsistent, reports intermittent palpitations occurring approximately every minute after caffeine consumption, specifically after drinking espresso macchiato. The palpitations intensified with anxiety and notably disrupted sleep, with latency to sleep around 1:30 am.

when typing at my desk I felt a warm feeling on my left wrist and when I looked down a lump was forming. A few minutes later a lump formed (smaller) on my right wrist in the exact same spot. The lump is located right pass my wrist bone on my thumb side. The lumps has gone down but my arms and hands are soar.,"The symptoms you describe—warmth and lump formation on both wrists near the thumb side, followed by soreness in your arms and hands—could suggest inflammation of the tendons or a possible early sign of a condition like De Quervain's tenosynovitis, which affects the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. It could also be related to repetitive strain or minor injury from typing.

However, the sudden appearance of lumps and warmth could also indicate other issues such as localized swelling, cysts, or even an inflammatory or vascular problem.

**Recommendations:**
- Rest your wrists and avoid repetitive movements that worsen symptoms.
- Apply ice to reduce swelling if the lumps reappear.
- Use a wrist splint to immobilize the area if possible.
- Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications may help with soreness.

If the lumps persist, increase in size, become very painful, or if you develop numbness, tingling, or weakness, seek medical evaluation promptly.

Its no pain my stomach but it feels like pressure or somethingi feel like i gotta vomit but i dont that funny feling in my head i only geag dat when i sit up or lay down so rite now i am laying down cause either way i het it","Your symptoms of a bad toothache near your wisdom teeth, followed by a weird feeling in one side of your head near the eyes, and stomach discomfort after starting clindamycin, could be related to several issues:

1. **Infection or inflammation** from the tooth or wisdom tooth area could be causing referred pain or headache.
2. **Side effects of clindamycin** can include stomach upset, nausea, and sometimes dizziness or headache.
3. The headache and weird head sensation that changes with position might suggest sinus involvement or a migraine triggered by infection or medication.

**What you should do:**
- Contact your oral surgeon or healthcare provider immediately to report these new symptoms.
- If you develop severe headache, vision changes, persistent vomiting, high fever, or worsening symptoms, seek emergency care.
- Continue to stay hydrated and avoid any medications not prescribed.
- Do not stop clindamycin without consulting your doctor, but inform them about your symptoms.

Your symptoms need prompt evaluation to rule out complications like spreading infection or medication side effects. Please seek medical advice urgently.","Key points from the case:
- 18-year-old with frequent severe headaches (suggesting a possible underlying headache disorder or neurological issue).
- Recent severe toothache in the left lower wisdom tooth area.
- Started clindamycin (an antibiotic).

- Symptoms worsen in the morning.
- Associated with abdominal pressure sensation (no pain), nausea without vomiting.
- Normal bowel movements.
- Head symptoms are positional (occur both sitting and lying down).

---

**Analysis:**

1. **Positional headache and morning worsening:**  
   Headaches or head sensations that worsen in the morning and are positional raise concern for increased intracranial pressure (ICP). ICP often worsens overnight due to lying flat and can cause morning headaches, nausea, and other symptoms.

2. **Localization near the eye:**  
   The front left side near the eye could suggest involvement of the trigeminal nerve or possibly a cluster headache or migraine, but the positional nature and morning worsening are less typical for primary headaches.

3. **Recent dental infection and antibiotic use:**  
   The toothache and clindamycin use suggest a recent or ongoing dental infection. Dental infections can rarely lead to complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis or intracranial spread of infection, which can cause neurological symptoms and increased ICP.

4. **Abdominal pressure sensation and nausea:**  
   Nausea without vomiting and abdominal pressure sensation can be nonspecific but may be related to increased ICP or systemic illness.

5. **Normal bowel movements:**  
   This suggests no acute gastrointestinal obstruction or severe systemic illness affecting bowel function.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

- **Increased intracranial pressure (ICP), possibly secondary to intracranial complication of dental infection (e.g., cavernous sinus thrombosis or intracranial abscess).**

The positional nature of symptoms, morning worsening, nausea, and localized head sensation near the eye (an area drained by the cavernous sinus) strongly suggest a neurological complication.

**Recommended next steps:**

- Urgent neuroimaging (MRI or CT with contrast) to evaluate for intracranial infection or thrombosis.
- Neurological evaluation.
- Possible hospitalization for IV antibiotics and management.

Key points:
- Tight foreskin that won't retract (phimosis)
- Itching and crusty ring (inflammation or infection)
- Burning and urine spraying (urethral irritation or obstruction)

Possible causes:
- Bacterial or fungal infection (common in balanitis)
- Poor hygiene or irritation
- Underlying skin condition (eczema, psoriasis)
- Untreated phimosis leading to inflammation

What you should do:
1. **See a healthcare provider promptly**—this needs evaluation and treatment.
2. Keep the area clean and dry.
3. Avoid irritants like soaps or lotions.
4. Your doctor may prescribe:
   - Topical antifungal or antibiotic creams
   - Steroid creams to reduce inflammation
   - Oral antibiotics if infection is severe
5. If phimosis is severe and persistent, circumcision or other surgical options may be considered.

Do not try to forcibly retract the foreskin as it can cause pain and injury.

If you develop fever, severe pain, or inability to urinate, seek emergency care immediately.

TOOTH DOESNT HURT AT ALL, SHERRY","Hi Sherry, a liquid-filled blister on the gums near a tooth with a silver cap (likely a crown) that comes and goes over weeks could be a dental abscess or a mucous cyst. Even without pain, it may indicate an underlying infection or irritation.

**Suggestions:**
- See your dentist promptly for an evaluation.
- The dentist may take X-rays to check for infection under the crown.
- Avoid irritating the area with hard or hot foods.
- Maintain good oral hygiene but be gentle around the blister.

Do not ignore it, as untreated infections can worsen. If you develop pain, swelling, or fever, seek urgent dental care.","The most likely diagnosis is a **mucocele** or a **dental abscess with a sinus tract**.

However, given the location on the gums beneath a silver-capped tooth and the intermittent appearance and disappearance of a liquid-filled blister without pain, the most probable diagnosis is a **parulis (gumboil)** associated with a chronic periapical abscess. This occurs when a chronic dental infection drains through a sinus tract onto the gingiva, forming a painless, fluctuant blister that can come and go.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Location beneath a tooth with a restoration (silver cap) suggests possible chronic infection.
- Intermittent blister due to drainage of pus.
- Lack of pain is common in chronic abscesses with sinus tracts.

**Recommendation:** The patient should have a dental evaluation including radiographs to assess for periapical pathology and receive appropriate treatment such as root canal therapy or extraction.

If the lesion is more mucosal and not related to infection, a mucocele (mucous cyst) is possible but less common on the gingiva and more common on the lower lip or floor of mouth.

Pain is none to minimal in cases where the fluid or pus Chat Doctor. . But to rule out the exact cause consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and an x-ray should be done. If there is tooth Infection then Root canal treatment can be done followed by antibiotics and painkillers. If there is gum Infection then localized cleaning can be done followed by antibiotics and gum paint massage. Hope this helps. Regards.","The most likely diagnosis is a **mucocele** or a **dental abscess with a sinus tract**.

However, given the location on the gums beneath a silver-capped tooth and the intermittent appearance and disappearance of a liquid-filled blister without pain, the most probable diagnosis is a **parulis (gumboil)** associated with a chronic periapical abscess. This occurs when a chronic dental infection drains through a sinus tract onto the gingiva, forming a painless, fluctuant blister that can come and go.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Location beneath a tooth with a restoration (silver cap) suggests possible chronic infection.
- Intermittent blister due to drainage of pus.
- Lack of pain is common in chronic abscesses with sinus tracts.

**Recommendation:** The patient should have a dental evaluation including radiographs to assess for periapical pathology and receive appropriate treatment such as root canal therapy or extraction.

If the lesion is more mucosal and not related to infection, a mucocele (mucous cyst) is possible but less common on the gingiva and more common on the lower lip or floor of mouth.

**Summary:** Most likely diagnosis is a chronic periapical abscess with a draining sinus tract (parulis).",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
I am a female age 60.  I am visiting my daughter in Guam.  I was stung by the bonnie bee on my right hand.  It is swollen and while it doesnt hurt like it did it really iches a lot and feels like it is spreading up my arm.  I have been taking benedril and applying cortisone cream to the bite.  Is there anything else I should do?  Thanks so much.   Cheryl Eggart  I am on meds for high blood pressure and colestrol which both are well under control.  I had a masectomy this year of my left breast and am taking preventive cancer meds.  I am cancer free.,"Hi Cheryl,

It sounds like you are having a significant allergic or inflammatory reaction to the bee sting, especially with the swelling, intense itching, and spreading sensation up your arm. Here are some important steps and considerations:

1. **Monitor for signs of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis):**  
   - Difficulty breathing or swallowing  
   - Swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat  
   - Dizziness or fainting  
   - Rapid heartbeat  
   If any of these occur, seek emergency medical care immediately.

2. **Current treatment:**  
   - Taking Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and applying cortisone cream is appropriate for mild to moderate allergic reactions.  
   - Continue these, but avoid scratching to prevent infection.

3. **Additional recommendations:**  
   - Elevate your arm to reduce swelling.  
   - Apply a cold compress to the area for 10-15 minutes several times a day.  
   - If swelling and redness continue to spread or worsen, or if you develop fever, warmth, or increased pain, you may have an infection or cellulitis and should see a healthcare provider promptly.  
   - Consider using an oral corticosteroid (like prednisone) if symptoms worsen or do not improve, but this requires a doctor’s prescription.  
   - Since you are on other medications and have a history of cancer, it’s best to consult a local healthcare provider for personalized advice.

4. **When to seek urgent care:**  
   - Rapidly spreading redness or swelling  
   - Signs of infection (fever, warmth, pus)  
   - Systemic symptoms like fever, chills, or feeling unwell  
   - Any signs of anaphylaxis as mentioned above

In summary, continue your current treatment, monitor closely, and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or you develop systemic signs. If you have an epinephrine auto-injector prescribed in the past for allergies, have it ready.

Stay safe and feel free to ask if you need more guidance!","The most likely diagnosis is a **large local allergic reaction (LLR) to the bee sting**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Swelling and intense itching at the sting site, spreading up the arm, indicate an allergic reaction.
- Use of diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) and topical corticosteroids is appropriate initial management for allergic reactions.
- The reaction is localized but spreading, consistent with a large local reaction rather than a systemic anaphylactic reaction (which would include symptoms like difficulty breathing, hypotension, or generalized urticaria).
- No mention of systemic symptoms or signs of infection.

The doctor's advice to avoid chocolate, ice cream, and citrus items is likely to reduce potential triggers that can worsen symptoms.

This condition is often manageable and can improve significantly with proper treatment and trigger avoidance. Most children recover well or have good control over symptoms with medication and lifestyle changes.

Regarding Siddha medicine, some people use traditional treatments as complementary therapy, but it is important to continue the prescribed treatment from your doctor and discuss any alternative therapies with them first to ensure safety and avoid interactions.

In summary:

Masturbation is a normal activity and does not cause physical weakness, loss of height, or muscle pain. Your symptoms of weakness, weight loss, difficulty concentrating, and muscle pain may be due to other health issues that need medical evaluation.

I strongly recommend you visit a nearby doctor or hospital for a full health check-up. They may perform blood tests and other investigations to find the cause of your symptoms.

Meanwhile, focus on:
- Eating a balanced, nutritious diet
- Getting regular sleep (7-8 hours)
- Doing light exercise or walking daily
- Avoiding stress and practicing relaxation techniques

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Chronic malnutrition or an underlying systemic illness (e.g., tuberculosis, endocrine disorder such as hypogonadism or growth hormone deficiency).**

**Rationale:**  
- Masturbation itself does not cause physical or mental weakness, weight loss, or decreased height.  
- Decrease in height at 18 years is unusual and suggests possible growth plate issues or chronic illness affecting growth.  
- Muscle pain and weakness with weight loss point toward a chronic disease or nutritional deficiency.  
- Difficulty concentrating may be secondary to systemic illness or nutritional deficits.

- Detailed clinical examination and history to rule out chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis), endocrine disorders (thyroid, adrenal, pituitary), or nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D, B12).  
- Laboratory tests: CBC, ESR, thyroid function tests, serum cortisol, growth hormone levels, nutritional markers.

"Hi dr.,my wife had undergone follicle study and the egg was ruptured on 12th day so my gyn told to have sex from that day itself.We had sex once in a day from 12th day to 20th day . On today  she got her periods. i have a question Why she havent had pregnancy as we had sex during rupture of egg.Is any thing serious or she will be never pregnent.Is any problem with her.please help me I am nervous,please reply.","It's understandable to feel nervous, but having periods after ovulation and intercourse is common and does not necessarily mean there is a serious problem. Here are some key points:

1. **Timing and Fertilization:** Even if the egg ruptured on day 12, fertilization depends on sperm meeting the egg within a short window (12-24 hours). Having sex from day 12 to 20 is good, but pregnancy is not guaranteed every cycle.

2. **Normal Cycle:** Getting your wife's period means that fertilization and implantation did not occur this cycle. This is normal and happens to many couples trying to conceive.

3. **No Immediate Concern:** One cycle without pregnancy is not a sign of infertility or a serious problem. It often takes several cycles to conceive.

4. **Next Steps:** Continue trying as advised by your doctor. If pregnancy does not occur after 6-12 months of regular unprotected intercourse, then further evaluation may be needed.

5. **Emotional Support:** Try to stay positive and reduce stress, as it can affect fertility.

If you have concerns, discuss them with your gynecologist who can review your wife's overall health and fertility status. But for now, there is no indication of a serious problem based on this information.","The most likely explanation is that the patient does **not** have a fertility problem. 

Key points:
- The follicle ruptured on day 12, indicating ovulation occurred.
- Intercourse was timed daily from day 12 to day 20, covering the fertile window.
- Despite this, menstruation occurred, indicating no pregnancy this cycle.

It is important to note that even with perfectly timed intercourse and confirmed ovulation, the chance of conception in a single cycle is about 20-25%. Many couples require several cycles of timed intercourse before pregnancy occurs.

**Conclusion:**  
This single cycle outcome is normal and does not indicate infertility. Fertility evaluation is generally recommended only after 12 months of regular, unprotected intercourse without conception (or 6 months if the woman is over 35). 

If the couple continues to have regular cycles and timed intercourse without pregnancy over several months, then further fertility assessment may be considered.","Dear user, welcome to Chat Doctor.

"Hi dr im a 30 years old professional, i used to mastubrat alot   which in effect my memory badly. You know Dr nowaday it become very defficult for me to work specialy in a stressful situation. I may get terminated from my job due to this memory loss. Please help Dr. Thanks","Thank you for sharing your concerns. It's important to know that occasional masturbation is generally not linked to memory loss or cognitive problems. However, excessive masturbation, especially if it interferes with daily life, sleep, or causes stress, might contribute to fatigue or difficulty concentrating.

Your memory difficulties and trouble handling stress could be related to other factors such as:

- Stress or anxiety  
- Poor sleep quality  
- Nutritional deficiencies  
- Underlying medical or mental health conditions  

I recommend the following steps:

1. **See a healthcare professional** for a thorough evaluation to rule out any medical or psychological causes of your memory issues.  
2. **Practice stress management techniques** like mindfulness, exercise, and adequate rest.  
3. **Maintain a balanced lifestyle** with good nutrition, regular sleep, and moderate physical activity.  
4. **Limit activities that cause distress or interfere with your daily functioning.**

If you feel comfortable, a mental health professional can also help address stress and coping strategies.

If you want, I can guide you on how to prepare for a medical appointment or suggest some stress-relief techniques. Would you like that?","The most likely diagnosis is **stress-related cognitive impairment (mild cognitive dysfunction due to stress/anxiety)** rather than a direct effect of masturbation. 

Key points supporting this:
- Memory difficulties worsen in stressful situations.
- No known physiological link between masturbation and memory impairment.
- Stress and anxiety commonly impair attention, working memory, and recall.
- The patient's concern about job loss and stress may be contributing to cognitive symptoms.

Recommendation:
- Evaluate for anxiety or depressive disorders.
- Consider stress management techniques and possibly cognitive behavioral therapy.
- Rule out other causes of memory impairment if symptoms persist or worsen.

"My husband has a rash on his inner arms. It is small and round but varies in size up to a pea. It started on his inner bicep on one arm and has gone away but appeared on his inner forearm on the same side. Now it s also on his other arm, same places. It doesn t itch , it s not wide spread, just a couple small patches or a single circular dry, raised rash. What could it be?","The description of small, round, dry, raised rashes that appear on the inner arms, move locations, and are not itchy suggests a few possible conditions:

1. **Nummular eczema** – coin-shaped dry patches that can appear on arms, often dry and raised.
2. **Tinea corporis (ringworm)** – fungal infection causing round, raised, sometimes scaly patches; usually mildly itchy but can be asymptomatic.
3. **Pityriasis rosea** – usually starts with a single patch and then spreads, but typically more widespread.
4. **Granuloma annulare** – raised, ring-shaped lesions, often on hands or arms, usually asymptomatic.
5. **Contact dermatitis** – but usually itchy and related to exposure.

Since the rash is not itchy, not widespread, and migrates, granuloma annulare or nummular eczema are more likely. However, a fungal infection should be ruled out.

**Recommendation:** Have a healthcare provider examine the rash. They may perform a skin scraping or biopsy to confirm diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment.

"I am taking 2.5 Ramapril, 2.5 Bisoprolol, 10 Prasagrel.  I had a STEMI July 12, got emerg stent in LAD.  Trop was .25 (it was .01 4 days later).  T was inverted until ECG on 09/19/2012 then resolved to normal ECG.  What causes sensation of pounding heartbeat o","The sensation of a pounding heartbeat (palpitations) after a STEMI and stent placement can be caused by several factors, including:

1. **Medication effects:** Bisoprolol (a beta-blocker) and Ramipril (an ACE inhibitor) usually help control heart rate and blood pressure, but sometimes medications or their adjustments can cause palpitations.
2. **Arrhythmias:** After a myocardial infarction, abnormal heart rhythms (like premature beats or atrial fibrillation) can cause pounding sensations.
3. **Increased sympathetic activity:** Anxiety or stress related to the cardiac event can increase heart rate and force of contraction.
4. **Residual ischemia or heart muscle changes:** Even after stenting, some areas of the heart may be irritated or healing, causing palpitations.
5. **Electrolyte imbalances or other systemic causes.**

Given your history, it is important to report these symptoms to your cardiologist promptly. They may recommend an ECG, Holter monitor, or adjustment of medications to evaluate and manage the cause of palpitations safely.","The patient has a history of STEMI treated with LAD stenting, with initial troponin elevation that normalized, and T wave inversions that resolved by 09/19/2012. Current medications include Ramipril, Bisoprolol, and Prasugrel. The new symptom is a sensation of pounding heartbeat (palpitations).

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
The sensation of pounding heartbeat in a post-MI patient on beta-blocker therapy is most commonly due to **arrhythmia**, such as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or atrial arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter). Given the history of myocardial infarction and stenting, the myocardium may have areas of scar or irritability predisposing to arrhythmias.

Other considerations:  
- Inadequate beta-blockade or medication side effects  
- Anxiety or increased sympathetic tone  
- Less likely: reinfarction (troponin is normalized, no new ECG changes reported)

**Summary:**  
The most likely diagnosis is a cardiac arrhythmia causing palpitations in a post-STEMI patient. Further evaluation with ECG and possibly Holter monitoring is warranted to confirm the arrhythmia type and guide management.","Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you some advises. My opinion as cardiologist is that we are dealing with a rhythm issue. You might experience fast heart beats or pounding sensation for different reasons. It may be a simple sinus tachycardia. This mean that your heart beats over 100 beats for minute. Its normal range should be between 60-100 beat for minute in resting situation. It may happen for different reasons from simple emotional stores to different pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. This pounding sensation might happen because of extrasistoles.These is electrical impulses that generates from different parts of the heart different from that of a normal sinus rhythm. This houses an ectopic heart beat that you feel like a skipped beat or as a palpitation Extrasistoles might happen for the same reasons as sinus tachycardia. All sow that might be frequent in ischemic heart disease or in patient after a heart attack because of changes of the heart muscle. In fact, you take medications to prevent this rhythm problems. Bisoprolol is a medication that gets down your heart frequency and extra systolic beats. But if you feel your fast heart beasts and this begins to interfere with your normal daily life it means that the medication might be insufficient. So, Bisoprolol helps you not to feel this heart beats but if you do, it means that you need to do a simple check up to see what's happening with an electrocardiogram and a holder monitoring. After judging the results we might talk for the treatment Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you some advises. My opinion as cardiologist is that we are dealing with a rhythm issue. You might experience fast heart beats or pounding sensation for different reasons. It may be a simple sinus tachycardia. This mean that your heart beats over 100 beats for minute. Its normal range should be between 60-100 beat for minute in resting situation. It may happen for different reasons from simple emotional stores to different pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. This pounding sensation might happen because of extrasistoles.These is electrical impulses that generates from different parts of the heart different from that of a normal sinus rhythm. This houses an ectopic heart beat that you feel like a skipped beat or as a palpitation Extrasistoles might happen for the same reasons as sinus tachycardia. All sow that might be frequent in ischemic heart disease or in patient after a heart attack because of changes of the heart muscle. In fact, you take medications to prevent this rhythm problems. Bisoprolol is a medication that gets down your heart frequency and extra systolic beats. But if you feel your fast heart beasts and this begins to interfere with your normal daily life it means that the medication might be insufficient. So, Bisoprolol helps you not to feel this heart beats but if you do, it means that you need to do a simple check up to see what's happening with an electrocardiogram and a holder monitoring. After judging the results we might talk for the treatment Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards","The sensation of a pounding heartbeat (palpitations) after a STEMI and stent placement can be caused by several factors, including:

1. **Medication effects:** Bisoprolol (a beta-blocker) and Ramipril (an ACE inhibitor) usually help control heart rate and blood pressure, but sometimes medications or their adjustments can cause palpitations.
2. **Arrhythmias:** After a myocardial infarction, abnormal heart rhythms (like premature beats or atrial fibrillation) can cause pounding sensations.
3. **Increased sympathetic activity:** Anxiety or stress related to the cardiac event can increase heart rate and force of contraction.
4. **Residual ischemia or heart muscle changes:** Even after stenting, some areas of the heart may be irritated or healing, causing palpitations.
5. **Electrolyte imbalances or other systemic causes.**

Given your history, it is important to report these symptoms to your cardiologist promptly. They may recommend an ECG, Holter monitor, or adjustment of medications to evaluate and manage the cause of palpitations safely.","The patient has a history of STEMI treated with LAD stenting, with initial troponin elevation that normalized, and T wave inversions that resolved by 09/19/2012. Current medications include Ramipril, Bisoprolol, and Prasugrel. The new symptom is a sensation of pounding heartbeat (palpitations).

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
The sensation of pounding heartbeat in a post-MI patient on beta-blocker therapy is most commonly due to **arrhythmia**, such as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or atrial arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter). Given the history of myocardial infarction and stenting, the myocardium may have areas of scar or irritability predisposing to arrhythmias.

Other considerations:  
- Inadequate beta-blockade or medication side effects  
- Anxiety or increased sympathetic tone  
- Less likely: reinfarction (troponin is normalized, no new ECG changes reported)

**Summary:**  
The most likely diagnosis is a cardiac arrhythmia causing palpitations in a post-STEMI patient. Further evaluation with ECG and possibly Holter monitoring is warranted to confirm the arrhythmia type and guide management.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"My Son age is 16. Taken him to doctor due to weakness and pale skin symptoms. He under gone the following tests.

All above took one week time (from 24.10.14 to 30.10.14) What is the test or treatment you recommend for above patient.Please suggest. Thanks, Prasad.","Based on the information provided:

- Your son has severe anemia (Hb 5.7 g/dL).
- Elevated LDH (2275 IU/L) suggests increased red blood cell destruction (hemolysis).
- Normal reticulocyte count initially, normal stool occult blood, normal iron studies, and normal Coombs tests.

**Interpretation:**
- Severe anemia with very high LDH points toward hemolytic anemia.
- Negative Coombs tests suggest it may not be autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
- Normal iron studies and no blood loss on stool occult blood test reduce likelihood of iron deficiency or bleeding.
- Normal liver function and kidney function tests.

**Recommended next steps:**

1. **Peripheral blood smear examination:** To look for abnormal red cell morphology (e.g., spherocytes, schistocytes, sickle cells) which can help identify hemolytic anemia causes.
2. **Reticulocyte count (repeat):** To assess bone marrow response; usually elevated in hemolysis.
3. **Haptoglobin level:** Low in hemolysis.
4. **Additional hemolysis workup:** 
   - Serum bilirubin (indirect/unconjugated)
   - Coagulation profile if indicated
5. **Bone marrow examination:** If diagnosis remains unclear.
6. **Consider hemoglobin electrophoresis:** To rule out hemoglobinopathies.
7. **Consult hematologist:** For further evaluation and management.

**Treatment:**
- Immediate management of severe anemia may require blood transfusion.
- Treat underlying cause once identified.
- Supportive care and monitoring.

**Summary:**
Your son likely has a hemolytic anemia. Further hematological evaluation including peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, and possibly bone marrow biopsy is needed. Please consult a hematologist urgently for detailed evaluation and treatment planning.","Key clinical points:
- 16-year-old male with weakness and pallor
- Severe anemia (Hb 5.7 g/dL)
- Normal reticulocyte count initially (implied since no mention of elevation)
- Normal urine, electrolytes, renal function, ECG, echo
- Normal stool occult blood (no GI bleeding)
- Normal liver function tests
- Elevated LDH (2275 IU/L) — markedly high
- Normal iron studies and Coombs tests (both direct and indirect)

Interpretation:
- Severe anemia with high LDH suggests hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis.
- Normal Coombs tests argue against autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
- Normal iron studies and no bleeding exclude iron deficiency anemia.
- Normal reticulocyte count initially is unusual in hemolysis but may be early or marrow suppression.
- Elevated LDH is a marker of cell breakdown, commonly elevated in hemolysis.
- No evidence of bleeding or chronic disease.

Most likely diagnosis:
- Given the age, severe anemia, high LDH, and negative Coombs, a hemolytic anemia of non-immune cause is likely.
- The most common causes in this age group include hereditary hemolytic anemias such as:
  - Sickle cell disease (would have abnormal peripheral smear)
  - Thalassemia (would have abnormal blood smear and iron studies)
  - G6PD deficiency (usually episodic hemolysis)
  - Hereditary spherocytosis (would show spherocytes on smear)
- Since peripheral smear was done and presumably normal, and no mention of abnormal cells, these are less likely.
- Another possibility is a hemolytic anemia due to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), but no mention of schistocytes or thrombocytopenia.
- Elevated LDH with severe anemia and normal Coombs suggests **paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)**, a rare acquired hemolytic anemia characterized by complement-mediated RBC lysis, elevated LDH, and negative Coombs test.
- PNH can present with severe anemia, elevated LDH, and normal iron studies.
- The normal urine study is unusual since hemoglobinuria is common in PNH, but it may be intermittent.

Conclusion:
**Most likely diagnosis: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).**

Further confirmatory tests:
- Flow cytometry for CD55 and CD59 deficiency on RBCs and granulocytes.

A 3.6 cm hypo-echoic lesion on ultrasound is consistent with a fibroid and usually not cancerous. 

Key points:
- Fibroids are generally not cancerous and rarely turn into cancer.
- They can cause symptoms like heavy periods, pain, or pressure, but many women have fibroids without symptoms.
- Uterus removal (hysterectomy) is one treatment option, but not always necessary unless symptoms are severe.
- Having had breast tumors in the past does not directly increase the risk of uterine fibroids or uterine cancer, but it is important to follow up with your doctor for overall health monitoring.
- Your mother’s doctor will guide the best treatment based on symptoms, fibroid size, and overall health.

Key points addressing the questions:

1. **Need for hysterectomy:**  
   - A 3.6 x 3.6 cm fibroid is relatively small.  
   - Hysterectomy is generally not required unless the fibroid causes significant symptoms (heavy bleeding, pain, pressure symptoms) or grows substantially.  
   - Many fibroids are managed conservatively or with less invasive treatments.

2. **Risk of malignancy:**  
   - Uterine fibroids are benign and very rarely transform into leiomyosarcoma (malignant tumor).  
   - The risk of malignancy is extremely low, especially in a stable, hypoechoic lesion without suspicious features.

3. **Relation to previous breast tumors:**  
   - Most breast tumors (benign or malignant) are unrelated to uterine fibroids.  
   - However, some hormone-sensitive tumors (e.g., estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer) and fibroids both respond to estrogen, but this does not imply a direct causal relationship.  
   - A history of breast tumors does not increase the risk of uterine fibroids or vice versa.

**Summary:**  
- Diagnosis: Benign uterine fibroid (leiomyoma).  
- Management: Observation or symptom-based treatment; hysterectomy not routinely needed.  
- Malignancy risk: Very low.  
- Breast tumor history: Likely unrelated.

"Hello,Two weeks ago, to date, I had 4 wisdom teeth extracted. Everything seemed to heal fine until yesterday when my final stitcChatDoctore out. Unlike the other times, I felt a sharp pain when it came out. Since then, my cheek has swollen where the cheek and gum meet inside. I went to my oral surgeon today and he said nothing looked wrong, but went ahead and wrote me a rx for a swelling medication and a mouthwash. My mouth is in pain at the site, and the swelling is becoming noticeable from the outside. Id it is relevant, I smoke (my doctor said I could after 7 days). This is also possibly the site where the numbing was injected. Again, no problem for 14 days and now this.","Your symptoms—sharp pain when the stitch came out, followed by swelling and pain at the extraction site two weeks post-op—could indicate a localized infection or inflammation, possibly a dry socket or a developing abscess. Smoking can impair healing and increase the risk of complications after wisdom tooth extraction, even if done after 7 days.

Since your oral surgeon has already prescribed medication and mouthwash, it is important to follow their instructions closely. However, if the swelling worsens, you develop fever, severe pain, difficulty opening your mouth, or spreading redness, you should seek urgent care as these may indicate a spreading infection.

In summary:
- Your symptoms suggest possible infection or inflammation at the extraction site.
- Smoking may be contributing to delayed healing.
- Follow prescribed treatment and maintain good oral hygiene.
- Monitor for worsening symptoms and seek prompt care if they occur.

- Smoking history, which is a significant risk factor for dry socket due to impaired healing and clot dislodgement.
- Pain localized to the extraction site, often radiating and severe.
- External swelling may indicate localized inflammation secondary to dry socket.

Regarding your large osteophyte at C5-C6:

- Osteophytes (bone spurs) generally do not resolve (lyse) on their own.
- If the osteophyte is causing significant nerve compression and symptoms persist despite conservative treatment (medications, physical therapy), surgical removal may be necessary.
- Your surgeon will evaluate the severity of symptoms, neurological findings, and imaging to decide if revision surgery is indicated.

I recommend discussing these findings and your symptoms in detail with your spine surgeon to determine the best management plan. Conservative treatment is usually tried first unless there is progressive neurological deficit.","The most likely diagnosis is **adjacent segment disease (ASD)** or **postoperative osteophyte formation causing nerve root irritation** at the C5-C6 level.

- The patient had a discectomy with cage and fixation at C5-C6 for disc herniation.
- Postoperative severe pain initially improved, but persistent pain with paresthesia aggravated by neck movement suggests ongoing nerve root or spinal cord irritation.
- The CT scan shows a large osteophyte at the same level, which can cause foraminal stenosis or nerve root compression.
- Osteophyte formation is a common cause of recurrent symptoms after cervical fusion surgery, due to altered biomechanics and stress at the operated or adjacent levels.

They are not panic attacks, can you tell me what heart conditions she may have?","Your wife's symptoms of sudden rapid heart rate episodes every 2 months, accompanied by severe distress, difficulty breathing, and vision loss, lasting about 20 minutes, are concerning and warrant thorough evaluation.

Possible heart-related conditions include:

1. **Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT):** Sudden episodes of rapid heart rate originating above the ventricles, often causing palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness.

2. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** Rapid heart rhythm originating from the ventricles, which can cause severe symptoms and requires urgent evaluation.

3. **Arrhythmogenic conditions:** Such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or other accessory pathway-mediated tachycardias.

4. **Structural heart disease:** Such as cardiomyopathy or valve disorders that predispose to arrhythmias.

Given the severity and frequency of episodes, and the associated symptoms (breathlessness, vision loss), it is critical she sees a cardiologist promptly. Diagnostic tests likely needed include:

- Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Holter monitor or event recorder to capture arrhythmias
- Echocardiogram to assess heart structure
- Possibly electrophysiological study

If episodes are causing loss of vision and severe breathing difficulty, emergency evaluation is advised to rule out life-threatening arrhythmias or other causes.

Please seek urgent cardiology consultation for accurate diagnosis and management.","The patient's presentation of sudden, rapid heart rate episodes (paroxysmal tachycardia) lasting about 20 minutes, occurring every couple of months over several years, accompanied by severe symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, near loss of vision, and the need to assume a fetal position, suggests a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) or another form of paroxysmal tachyarrhythmia.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Sudden onset and termination of rapid heart rate episodes.
- Severe symptoms related to decreased cerebral perfusion (near loss of vision) and respiratory distress.
- Episodes lasting around 20 minutes.
- No history of panic attacks (which can mimic tachycardia but usually have different symptom patterns).

Other considerations like panic disorder are less likely given the denial of panic attacks and the severity of symptoms.

"I have had what I thought was a cold but may have been allergies.  it started with a sore throat, scratchy and tickleish cough, yellow mucus, runny nose.  This has been going on for over two weeks and now Im developing hives, which I can control by taking Benedryl.  It doesnt appear to be subsiding.  Is there something else I should be taking?","Your symptoms—sore throat, scratchy cough, yellow mucus, runny nose lasting over two weeks, now with hives—suggest a possible combination of ongoing infection or inflammation and an allergic reaction.

Key points:
- Yellow mucus often indicates a bacterial or viral infection rather than allergies.
- Hives controlled by Benadryl (an antihistamine) suggest an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.
- Persistent symptoms over two weeks warrant medical evaluation.

Recommendations:
1. See a healthcare provider for a thorough exam. They may consider:
   - A bacterial sinus infection or other infection needing antibiotics.
   - Allergy testing to identify triggers.
   - Alternative or additional allergy medications (e.g., non-sedating antihistamines like cetirizine or loratadine).
   - Possible corticosteroids if inflammation is significant.

2. Continue antihistamines as directed but avoid overuse of Benadryl due to sedation.

3. If you develop fever, worsening symptoms, difficulty breathing, or swelling, seek urgent care.

In summary, you should consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and tailored treatment beyond self-managing with Benadryl.","The most likely diagnosis is **allergic rhinitis with postnasal drip and associated allergic urticaria (hives)**.

Rationale:
- Symptoms lasting over two weeks suggest a non-viral cause, as typical colds resolve within 7-10 days.
- Yellow mucus can occur in allergies due to mucus stasis and inflammation, not necessarily infection.
- Sore throat and ticklish cough are common from postnasal drip in allergies.
- Development of hives controlled by diphenhydramine supports an allergic etiology.
- Persistent runny nose and symptoms beyond typical cold duration favor allergies over viral infection.

Recommendation:
- Consider allergy testing.
- Use second-generation antihistamines for better control.
- Nasal corticosteroids may help reduce nasal inflammation.
- Avoid known allergens if identified.","Hello Thanks for posting here. Your symptoms like runny nose, sore throat, cough, hives all point out that you may have allergic rhinitis. The upper airways i.e. your nose, throat are reacting unusually to some substance which can be present in the air, in your surroundings. Usually most common allergens are smoke, dust, pollen, pet hairs and some food products also etc. So get your house vacuum cleaned, stay away from pets and gardens. It can also be worsened due to climatic conditions. There are blood allergen tests and skin prick allergen tests which can determine what are you allergic to, so that you can take necessary precautions. For your symptoms you can take tablet montelukast FX 10MG once in the night for about 14 days. This tablet is a combination of montelukast and fexofenadine which will definitely take care of your hives, runny nose and other symptoms. Also do a spirometry which shows functional capacity of the lungs. Allergies can also involve the lower airways causing asthma.

"What is the average length of time off from work for bells palsy? I was diagnosed 6/11 & I see very slight improvement. I was prescribed 20 mg prednisone, 2 a day for 5 days,800 ml acyclovir, 5 a day for 7 days & 600 mg ibuprofen for pain, but my effected side (right) is having hearing problems ( feels like something is moving in my ear & popping sounds) have gotten worst & I have heavy pressure besides the paralysis & vertigo.","Bell's palsy recovery time varies, but most people start to improve within 2 to 3 weeks after onset, with full recovery typically occurring within 3 to 6 months. Time off work depends on the severity of symptoms and job demands; many return within a few weeks, but some may need longer if symptoms like vertigo and hearing issues persist.

Your symptoms of worsening hearing problems, ear pressure, and vertigo alongside facial paralysis are concerning and may indicate involvement of the inner ear or a more complex condition than typical Bell's palsy. It is important to contact your healthcare provider promptly for re-evaluation to rule out other causes such as Ramsay Hunt syndrome or an ear infection, and to adjust treatment if needed. If symptoms worsen or new neurological signs develop, seek urgent medical attention.","The patient's initial diagnosis was Bell's palsy, but the new symptoms—worsening hearing loss, ear fullness/pressure, popping sounds, sensations of movement in the ear, and vertigo—suggest involvement beyond isolated facial nerve paralysis.

**Most likely diagnosis:** Ramsay Hunt syndrome (Herpes Zoster Oticus)

**Rationale:**
- Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion.
- It presents with peripheral facial paralysis (similar to Bell's palsy) plus ear pain, vesicular rash (may or may not be present), hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and aural fullness.
- The patient's worsening hearing symptoms and vertigo are not typical for uncomplicated Bell's palsy.
- The prescribed acyclovir and prednisone are appropriate for Ramsay Hunt syndrome, but the progression of symptoms suggests possible incomplete response or delayed diagnosis.

**Recommendation:**
- Urgent ENT and neurology evaluation.
- Consider MRI to rule out other causes (e.g., vestibular neuritis, labyrinthitis, or central lesions).
- Close monitoring and possible adjustment of antiviral and corticosteroid therapy.

They said they are not sure what happen  and I think maybe I got bitten or something cause there was a mark there and know like I said still a mark but red around it and I was running a temp also of 100","Cephalexin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat skin infections. You should generally start to see improvement in redness, swelling, and pain within 48 to 72 hours of starting the medication. However, full resolution may take about 7 to 10 days depending on the severity of the infection.

It is absolutely okay to swallow the cephalexin capsules or tablets whole with water, as this is the normal way to take them. If you have a liquid form, follow the dosing instructions provided.

Since you have swelling, redness, and a fever (100°F), it’s important to monitor your symptoms closely. If the redness or swelling worsens, if you develop a higher fever, increased pain, or if you do not see any improvement after 3 days of antibiotics, you should contact your healthcare provider promptly.

In the meantime, keep the area clean, avoid touching or picking at it, and take the medication exactly as prescribed.

"Several months ago the day after my period I had sever pain, worse than anything other than child birth, on the left hand side of my abdomin. Each month after the same thing but not as painful has happened. I have had a internal ultrasound and they found a small kidney stone on my left kidney. I have also had painful bowl movements but in the last 3 weeks I have had heavy bleeding for several days and then spotting. The last 3 days I have experienced very sharp pain on my lower left abdomin. My doctor has booked me in for a right hand side X-ray and a specialist will be doing a internal ultrasound. Could it be endometriosis.","Your symptoms—severe left-sided abdominal pain after your period, recurring monthly pain, painful bowel movements, and recent heavy bleeding followed by spotting—could be consistent with endometriosis, especially given the cyclical nature of the pain related to your menstrual cycle. Endometriosis often causes pelvic pain, pain during bowel movements, and abnormal bleeding.

However, you also have a small kidney stone on the left side, which can cause significant pain and may contribute to your symptoms. The sharp pain in the lower left abdomen could be related to the kidney stone or another pelvic issue.

The planned internal ultrasound by a specialist is an important step to evaluate for endometriosis or other gynecological conditions. The right-side X-ray may be to assess other causes of pain or to check for stones on the other side.

In summary, endometriosis is a possible diagnosis, but further imaging and specialist evaluation are needed to confirm it and rule out other causes like kidney stones or gastrointestinal issues. Please follow up closely with your specialist and report any worsening symptoms such as severe pain, fever, or heavy bleeding.","The patient's history of severe cyclical left-sided abdominal pain occurring around menstruation, recurrent pain in the same area, painful bowel movements, and recent heavy vaginal bleeding with spotting strongly suggests **endometriosis** as the most likely diagnosis.

Key points supporting endometriosis:
- Severe, cyclical pain related to menstruation (dysmenorrhea).
- Pain localized to the left lower abdomen.
- Painful bowel movements, which can occur if endometrial implants involve the bowel.
- Abnormal uterine bleeding (heavy bleeding and spotting).
- Symptoms persisting and recurring over several months.

The small kidney stone found on ultrasound is likely incidental and does not fully explain the cyclical nature and severity of symptoms.

"-decreased articulation/processing -forgetfulness -constant hunger/thirst -frequent urination -blurred vision -hearing loss I am a high school girl and all these are very SUDDEN. I have a doctor s appointment in a few days, but I was just trying to get some generalizations before then. The past couple months I have had a sudden decline in my school work. I was a straight A+ student and now it s down to Bs and A-s. It takes me 2-3 times as long to do my work now. I was also a very articulate person with very good comprehension. Now I have to re-read things over and over. I m having difficulty finding words, using the right words and just making the right sounds. The rest of the symptoms I listed are self-explanatory. Please help me figure this out. Thank you so much!","I'm sorry to hear about the sudden changes you're experiencing. Your symptoms—decreased cognitive function (articulation, processing, forgetfulness), constant hunger and thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, and hearing loss—are concerning and suggest a systemic issue that needs prompt medical evaluation.

One possible explanation could be **new-onset diabetes mellitus**, especially type 1 diabetes, which can cause increased thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, and cognitive difficulties due to fluctuating blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can also affect brain function, leading to difficulty concentrating and memory problems.

Another possibility is a neurological or metabolic disorder affecting brain function, or an endocrine imbalance (such as thyroid problems).

Because these symptoms are sudden and affecting multiple systems (neurological, metabolic, sensory), it is very important to see your doctor as soon as possible. If symptoms worsen (such as confusion, severe vision changes, weakness, or severe hearing loss), seek emergency care immediately.

In the meantime:
- Monitor your blood sugar if you have a glucometer or can get tested.
- Stay hydrated.
- Avoid driving or operating machinery if your vision or cognition is impaired.

Your doctor will likely order blood tests (glucose, electrolytes, thyroid function, vitamin levels), neurological evaluation, and possibly imaging to determine the cause.

Please prioritize your appointment and inform your doctor about all these symptoms in detail. If you feel worse before then, seek urgent medical care.","The patient's symptoms include:

- Sudden decreased articulation and processing speed
- Forgetfulness and cognitive decline (difficulty with comprehension, word finding, speech production)
- Constant hunger and thirst (polyphagia, polydipsia)
- Frequent urination (polyuria)

**Most likely diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with possible diabetic encephalopathy or early diabetic complications affecting cognition and sensory nerves.**

Rationale:
- The classic triad of polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia strongly points to diabetes.

Hope to have been helpful! Greetings!","I'm sorry to hear about the sudden changes you're experiencing. Your symptoms—decreased cognitive function (articulation, processing, forgetfulness), constant hunger and thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, and hearing loss—are concerning and suggest a systemic issue that needs prompt medical evaluation.

One possible explanation could be **new-onset diabetes mellitus**, especially type 1 diabetes, which can cause increased thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, and cognitive difficulties due to fluctuating blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can also affect brain function, leading to difficulty concentrating and memory problems.

Another possibility is a neurological or metabolic disorder affecting brain function, or an endocrine imbalance (such as thyroid problems).

Because these symptoms are sudden and affecting multiple systems (neurological, metabolic, sensory), it is very important to see your doctor as soon as possible. If symptoms worsen (such as confusion, severe vision changes, weakness, or severe hearing loss), seek emergency care immediately.

In the meantime:
- Monitor your blood sugar if you have a glucometer or can get tested.
- Stay hydrated.
- Avoid driving or operating machinery if your vision or cognition is impaired.

Your doctor will likely order blood tests (glucose, electrolytes, thyroid function, vitamin levels), neurological evaluation, and possibly imaging to determine the cause.

Please prioritize your appointment and inform your doctor about all these symptoms in detail. If you feel worse before then, seek urgent medical care.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"Hi, I have had a high platelet count b/t 460-620 for about 3 years.  Is this normal?  I have suffered with chronic depression and stress- can those be factors?  The only other out of range blood count was my esinophils.  My red blood cells are within range but on lower end and my white blood cells are within in range but on upper end.","A platelet count between 460-620 x10^9/L is considered mildly to moderately elevated (normal range is typically 150-450 x10^9/L). Persistent high platelet counts over several years warrant evaluation to determine the cause.

Possible causes include:
- Reactive (secondary) thrombocytosis due to chronic inflammation, stress, or depression-related physiological changes.
- Iron deficiency.
- Chronic infections or inflammatory conditions.
- Less commonly, a myeloproliferative disorder (a bone marrow condition).

Chronic stress and depression can contribute to mild increases in platelet count through inflammatory and hormonal pathways, but they are less commonly the sole cause of persistent thrombocytosis.

Your elevated eosinophils suggest some allergic, parasitic, or inflammatory process, which could also contribute to reactive platelet elevation.

Given the duration and platelet levels, it is important to:
- Review iron studies, inflammatory markers, and any symptoms.
- Possibly consult a hematologist for further evaluation, including ruling out myeloproliferative disorders.

In summary, your platelet count is not normal and should be investigated further, but chronic stress and depression alone are unlikely to fully explain persistent elevation. Please discuss these findings with your healthcare provider for appropriate workup.","The patient has a persistently elevated platelet count (thrombocytosis) ranging from 460 to 620 x10^9/L over three years. Normal platelet counts typically range from about 150 to 400 x10^9/L, so this is a mild to moderate thrombocytosis.

Key points to consider:
- Persistent thrombocytosis over years suggests a chronic process rather than a transient reactive cause.
- Elevated eosinophils and white blood cells at the upper limit of normal may indicate some degree of chronic inflammation or a myeloproliferative process.
- Red blood cells at the lower limit of normal do not strongly point to a specific diagnosis but should be monitored.
- Depression and stress are not known to cause persistent thrombocytosis. They may cause transient changes in some blood parameters but not sustained platelet elevation.

Most likely diagnosis:
- **Essential thrombocythemia (ET)** or another myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is the most likely cause of persistent thrombocytosis, especially if reactive causes have been excluded.
- Secondary (reactive) thrombocytosis is usually due to inflammation, infection, iron deficiency, or malignancy, but these typically cause transient platelet elevation.
- Chronic inflammation or stress-related causes are unlikely to cause persistent platelet counts this high for years.

Recommended next steps:
- Evaluate for JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations (common in ET).
- Assess for iron deficiency, inflammation markers (CRP, ESR), and exclude infection or malignancy.
- Consider hematology referral for bone marrow biopsy if indicated.

This can cause redness, swelling, and a rough patch as it heals. Here’s what you can do:

1. Keep her mouth clean: Gently wipe her mouth with a clean, damp cloth.
2. Avoid irritants: Try to prevent her from putting rough or sharp objects in her mouth.
3. Soft foods: Offer soft, mild foods to avoid further irritation.
4. Monitor: Watch for signs of infection such as increased redness, swelling, pus, or if she seems in significant pain or refuses to eat.

I have tingling and numbness in my hands and feet often while in a sitting position. I have just recently been diagnosed as having minimal plaque in my arteries. I am overweight about 35 pounds. I am 63 years old. There is a family history of diabetes. I have dark urine the first few times I go in the morning.,"Your symptoms of tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, along with dark urine in the morning, combined with your recent diagnosis of minimal plaque in arteries, being overweight, and family history of diabetes, raise several important considerations:

1. **Peripheral Neuropathy:** Tingling and numbness in hands and feet can be signs of peripheral neuropathy, which is often related to diabetes or prediabetes. Given your family history and risk factors, it is important to evaluate your blood sugar levels (fasting glucose, HbA1c).

2. **Circulatory Issues:** Minimal plaque in arteries suggests some degree of atherosclerosis, which can impair blood flow and contribute to numbness or tingling.

3. **Dark Urine:** Dark urine in the morning can be due to dehydration, but it can also indicate liver or kidney issues, or the presence of blood or bilirubin. This needs further evaluation.

**Recommendations:**
- Get blood tests including fasting glucose, HbA1c, kidney and liver function tests, and a urinalysis.
- Discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider promptly to rule out diabetes, neuropathy, or other underlying conditions.
- Consider lifestyle changes such as weight loss, healthy diet, and regular exercise to improve vascular health.
- Monitor for any worsening symptoms like weakness, pain, or changes in urine color.

- Frequent tingling and numbness in hands and feet (suggestive of peripheral neuropathy)
- Overweight status and family history of diabetes (risk factors for diabetes)
- Minimal arterial plaque (early atherosclerosis)

I am 60 yrs old male. wt 85 kg ht 5 7 living in a hill station. While walking upward I feel heavy breathing and choking of throat. Then after a short rest able to walk slowly. and then this process is repeated. No problem in walking in plain areas. Last week angiography was done which is normal. I have been prescribed tablet Revelol XL25. Pl advise what is trouble and is it the right medicine for my problem.,"Your symptoms of heavy breathing and throat choking while walking uphill, but not on flat ground, suggest exertional dyspnea possibly related to cardiovascular or respiratory causes. Since your angiography is normal, significant coronary artery disease is less likely.

Revelol XL 25 (a beta-blocker, likely metoprolol) is commonly prescribed for heart conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmias, or heart failure. It can help reduce heart workload and improve symptoms if your doctor suspects a cardiac cause like angina or heart failure.

However, your symptoms could also be related to other issues such as:

- Respiratory problems (e.g., asthma, COPD)
- Deconditioning or obesity-related breathlessness
- Vocal cord or throat issues causing choking sensation
- Anxiety or other non-cardiac causes

Recommendations:
1. Follow your doctor's advice and take the prescribed medication.
2. Inform your doctor if symptoms worsen or do not improve.
3. Consider evaluation by a pulmonologist to rule out lung causes.
4. A thorough physical exam, lung function tests, and possibly a stress test may help clarify the cause.

In summary, Revelol XL may be appropriate if your doctor suspects a cardiac cause, but further evaluation is important to identify the exact reason for your symptoms.","Summary of key points:
- 60-year-old male, 85 kg, 170 cm (BMI ~29.4, overweight)
- Symptoms: heavy breathing and throat choking while walking uphill
- Symptoms improve with rest and slower walking
- No symptoms on flat terrain
- Recent angiography normal (rules out significant coronary artery disease)
- Prescribed Revelol XL 25 mg (a beta-blocker, likely metoprolol XL)

Interpretation:
- Symptoms triggered by increased exertion (walking uphill) but not on flat ground
- Angiography normal, so ischemic heart disease is unlikely cause
- Beta-blocker prescribed, possibly for hypertension or arrhythmia
- Symptoms of heavy breathing and throat choking suggest exertional dyspnea and possibly upper airway symptoms

Most likely diagnosis:
- Exertional dyspnea with throat choking on uphill walking, improving with rest, no ischemia, suggests **exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) or mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma exacerbated by exertion and altitude**.
- Living in a hill station (higher altitude) can exacerbate hypoxia and respiratory symptoms.
- Cardiac causes less likely given normal angiography and no symptoms on flat terrain.
- Beta-blockers can worsen bronchospasm, so if symptoms started or worsened after starting Revelol XL, this supports bronchospasm.

Other considerations:
- Vocal cord dysfunction (paradoxical vocal cord motion) can cause throat choking and dyspnea on exertion.
- Deconditioning or heart failure less likely given symptom pattern and normal angiography.

**Most likely diagnosis: Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) or mild asthma exacerbated by exertion and altitude.**

Recommendation:
- Pulmonary function tests with exercise challenge
- Trial of bronchodilators if indicated
- Review beta-blocker use if bronchospasm suspected

#Final diagnosis: Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) causing exertional dyspnea and throat choking at altitude.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Revelon XL 25 is metoprolol which is beta blocker. It will help you in this situation. Since your coronary angiography is normal, I don't think any cardiac disease is the cause for your current symptoms. So Beta blocker will not help you. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. As your symptoms like breathlessness on exertion is seen in Bronchitis. So better to rule out this. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and short course of antibiotics. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Don't take Revlon XP 25. It will not help you.","A 60-year-old male, weighing 85 kg and 170 cm tall, living in a hill station, experiences heavy breathing and throat choking while walking uphill.

The patient has been prescribed Revelol XL 25 mg. What is the most likely diagnosis?",model_response_og,doctor_output,model_response_conv,"Your symptoms of heavy breathing and throat choking while walking uphill, but not on flat ground, suggest exertional dyspnea possibly related to cardiovascular or respiratory causes. Since your angiography is normal, significant coronary artery disease is less likely.

Revelol XL 25 (a beta-blocker, likely metoprolol) is commonly prescribed for heart conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmias, or heart failure. It can help reduce heart workload and improve symptoms if your doctor suspects a cardiac cause like angina or heart failure.

However, your symptoms could also be related to other issues such as:

- Respiratory problems (e.g., asthma, COPD)
- Deconditioning or obesity-related breathlessness
- Vocal cord or throat issues causing choking sensation
- Anxiety or other non-cardiac causes

Recommendations:
1. Follow your doctor's advice and take the prescribed medication.
2. Inform your doctor if symptoms worsen or do not improve.
3. Consider evaluation by a pulmonologist to rule out lung causes.
4. A thorough physical exam, lung function tests, and possibly a stress test may help clarify the cause.

In summary, Revelol XL may be appropriate if your doctor suspects a cardiac cause, but further evaluation is important to identify the exact reason for your symptoms.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Revelon XL 25 is metoprolol which is beta blocker. It will help you in this situation. Since your coronary angiography is normal, I don't think any cardiac disease is the cause for your current symptoms. So Beta blocker will not help you. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. As your symptoms like breathlessness on exertion is seen in Bronchitis. So better to rule out this. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and short course of antibiotics. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Don't take Revlon XP 25. It will not help you.","Summary of key points:
- 60-year-old male, 85 kg, 170 cm (BMI ~29.4, overweight)
- Symptoms: heavy breathing and throat choking while walking uphill
- Symptoms improve with rest and slower walking
- No symptoms on flat terrain
- Recent angiography normal (rules out significant coronary artery disease)
- Prescribed Revelol XL 25 mg (a beta-blocker, likely metoprolol XL)

Interpretation:
- Symptoms triggered by increased exertion (walking uphill) but not on flat ground
- Angiography normal, so ischemic heart disease is unlikely cause
- Beta-blocker prescribed, possibly for hypertension or arrhythmia
- Symptoms of heavy breathing and throat choking suggest exertional dyspnea and possibly upper airway symptoms

Most likely diagnosis:
- Exertional dyspnea with throat choking on uphill walking, improving with rest, no ischemia, suggests **exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) or mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma exacerbated by exertion and altitude**.
- Living in a hill station (higher altitude) can exacerbate hypoxia and respiratory symptoms.
- Cardiac causes less likely given normal angiography and no symptoms on flat terrain.
- Beta-blockers can worsen bronchospasm, so if symptoms started or worsened after starting Revelol XL, this supports bronchospasm.

Other considerations:
- Vocal cord dysfunction (paradoxical vocal cord motion) can cause throat choking and dyspnea on exertion.
- Deconditioning or heart failure less likely given symptom pattern and normal angiography.

**Most likely diagnosis: Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) or mild asthma exacerbated by exertion and altitude.**

Recommendation:
- Pulmonary function tests with exercise challenge
- Trial of bronchodilators if indicated
- Review beta-blocker use if bronchospasm suspected

#Final diagnosis: Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) causing exertional dyspnea and throat choking at altitude.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"2 weeks ago I went to the hospital with chest pain and panic attack .  I had panic attack every day for a week  my dr prescribed me a low  doss of Xanax  it has helped with the panic attacks, but sometimes at night my head feels weird like I could have a seizure or something. then last night I was really tired and dose off and woke up because my legs were shaking real bad but when I woke up they quit what do you think this is?","Your symptoms of a ""weird"" head sensation and shaking legs after starting Xanax (a benzodiazepine) could be related to several possibilities:

1. **Medication side effects:** Xanax can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and sometimes unusual sensations or muscle twitching.
2. **Withdrawal or dose issues:** If doses are missed or fluctuating, withdrawal symptoms can include shaking or unusual sensations.
3. **Seizure activity:** Although less common, benzodiazepines can sometimes lower seizure threshold if stopped abruptly or in certain conditions.
4. **Other causes:** Anxiety itself can cause shaking and unusual sensations, and fatigue can worsen these symptoms.

Given your history of chest pain and panic attacks, and now these new neurological symptoms, it is important to:

- Contact your doctor promptly to discuss these new symptoms.
- Avoid stopping or changing your Xanax dose without medical advice.
- Seek urgent care if you experience loss of consciousness, prolonged shaking, confusion, or other concerning neurological symptoms.

Your doctor may want to evaluate you further to rule out seizures or other neurological issues and adjust your treatment accordingly.","The patient's history includes:

- Recent chest pain and panic attacks, initially treated with low-dose Xanax with improvement.
- New nighttime episodes of unusual head sensations described as possible seizures.
- Sudden awakening from sleep due to severe leg shaking that stops upon waking.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Nocturnal (sleep-related) myoclonus or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD)**

**Rationale:**  
- The leg shaking episodes occurring during sleep and causing awakening are characteristic of periodic limb movements or nocturnal myoclonus, which are involuntary, repetitive limb movements during sleep.
- The ""unusual sensation in the head"" described as possible seizure could be related to nocturnal sensory phenomena or partial seizures, but given the leg shaking and awakening, PLMD or sleep-related movement disorder is more likely.
- Panic attacks and anxiety can coexist but do not explain the nocturnal leg shaking.
- True nocturnal seizures are possible but less common; they usually have additional features such as tongue biting, incontinence, or postictal confusion.

**Next steps:**  
- Sleep study (polysomnography) to evaluate for periodic limb movements or nocturnal seizures.
- Neurology referral if seizures are suspected.
- Consider EEG if seizure activity is strongly suspected.

**Summary:**  
The most likely diagnosis is a sleep-related movement disorder such as periodic limb movement disorder causing leg shaking and awakening, rather than nocturnal seizures.","Hello, Many patients also report nocturnal (night) panic attacks and in a few minorities, panic attacks occur only at night. It is very much likely that what you experienced at night was also a panic attack. You should discuss with your doctor about taking medicines daily if you are taking it only as and when needed.

"I am a 27y old guy and am getting pain for the past 2 days when I open my jaw completely or chew something. I went to a dental clinic yesterday. The doc, after some testing and taking Xray confirmed that wisdom teeth is growing sidewards instead of straight direction and hence I need to remove it. So I want to know whether there is another option or is it the only way? If so, How much time medication is required?Suggest some good hospitals where this can be done in Bangalore(preferably in Marathahalli, Old Airport road), if u have some good information. Thanks in advance.","Based on your description and the dentist's findings, your wisdom tooth is impacted and growing sideways, which is a common cause of pain and difficulty in jaw movement. 

### Treatment Options:
1. **Surgical Removal (Extraction):** This is the most common and recommended treatment for impacted wisdom teeth causing pain or potential complications. Leaving it untreated can lead to infection, damage to adjacent teeth, or cyst formation.
2. **Conservative Management:** Pain relief with medications (NSAIDs), warm saline rinses, and avoiding hard foods can temporarily reduce symptoms but will not resolve the underlying problem.
3. **Monitoring:** In some cases, if the tooth is not causing significant issues, regular monitoring may be advised, but since you have pain and the tooth is growing sideways, extraction is usually the best option.

### Medication Duration:
- After extraction, pain and swelling typically subside within 3-7 days.
- Antibiotics (if prescribed) are usually taken for 5-7 days.
- Painkillers are used as needed, often for 2-5 days post-surgery.

### Hospitals/Clinics in Bangalore (Marathahalli, Old Airport Road):
- **Cloudnine Dental, Marathahalli:** Known for good dental care and oral surgery.
- **Apollo White Dental, Old Airport Road:** Offers comprehensive dental services including wisdom tooth extraction.
- **Fortis Dental Care, Marathahalli:** Experienced oral surgeons and good patient care.
- **Smilekraft Dental Clinic, Old Airport Road:** Well-reviewed for wisdom tooth surgeries.

Make sure to consult an oral surgeon for a detailed evaluation and discuss your concerns. Early removal often prevents complications.

If you want, I can help you with contact details or appointment booking for these centers.","The most likely diagnosis is **impacted horizontal wisdom tooth (third molar) causing pericoronitis or mechanical pain**.

Key points:
- Horizontal impaction of the wisdom tooth can cause pain due to pressure on adjacent teeth, inflammation, or infection.
- Symptoms include pain on jaw opening and chewing.
- X-ray confirms the abnormal position of the tooth.

Regarding treatment:
- **Surgical removal (extraction) is the definitive treatment** to prevent recurrent pain, infection, or damage to adjacent teeth.
- Conservative management (pain relief, antibiotics if infection is present) may provide temporary relief but does not resolve the underlying problem.
- Medication duration (e.g., antibiotics, analgesics) is usually short-term (5-7 days) postoperatively or during acute infection.

He dismissed me as perfectly normal. My neuro passed me back to my PCP, and after an MRI told me that it was basically the same Am I just a hypochondriac? I do not visit any doctor often to complain. I am truly frustrated and concerned that I might need help. I have an appointment with a new rheumatologist in a couple of weeks, but I am worried that I will again be passed off or dismissed.","Your symptoms are complex and involve multiple systems—neurological (balance issues, internal trembling, language difficulties, white halo flashes), rheumatologic (abnormal ANA, peeling nails, fatigue), and sensory (tingling, pain, itching without rash). Given your history of Dandy-Walker malformation and VP shunt, some neurological symptoms may relate to that, but the systemic symptoms and abnormal ANA suggest a possible autoimmune or connective tissue disorder.

It is important to advocate for yourself and communicate clearly with your new rheumatologist. Consider the following steps:

1. **Document Symptoms:** Keep a detailed symptom diary noting onset, duration, triggers, and severity.
2. **Bring Records:** Bring all previous test results, imaging, and notes from your PCP, neurologist, and labs.
3. **Request Comprehensive Evaluation:** Ask for evaluation for autoimmune diseases such as lupus, Sjogren’s syndrome, or other connective tissue diseases, which can cause abnormal ANA, fatigue, neuropathy, and nail changes.
4. **Neurological Follow-up:** Continue neurological follow-up to monitor your Dandy-Walker and shunt function, as some symptoms may overlap.
5. **Consider Multidisciplinary Approach:** Sometimes complex cases benefit from combined rheumatology, neurology, and possibly immunology input.

You are not a hypochondriac. Your symptoms are real and deserve thorough evaluation. If you feel dismissed, consider seeking a second opinion or a specialized center experienced in complex autoimmune and neurological disorders.

If symptoms worsen (e.g., severe weakness, vision changes, or new neurological deficits), seek urgent care.

- Systemic: extreme fatigue, itching without rash, intermittent tooth pain without dental cause.
- Lab: positive ANA on two occasions.
- Imaging: brain MRI non-contributory.
- History: Dandy-Walker malformation with VP shunt, PSVT.

"Im a 27 year old female, and Im having issues with my right lower jaw, and the right side of my neck. Im pretty sure its my right lower wisdom tooth thats causing my jaw pain, but, Im not so sure about the neck and throat pain. My neck/throat isnt too painful, just mildly uncomfortable when i swallow. When I turn my head to the left, thats when the pain hits. There is also a small lump on my esophagus/trachea. Im not really sure what its called so dont quote me on what it is :) But I can feel it when I swallow, feel it with my fingers, but, it cant be seen. I have a strong history of cancer in my family, and Im a smoker. Ive been noticing this pain and lump for about 2 months now. Ive had no cough, or fever, and only a mild sore throat where the lump is, only when I swallow.","Given your symptoms—right lower jaw pain likely related to your wisdom tooth, mild throat discomfort when swallowing, neck pain when turning your head, and a palpable lump near your throat/esophagus area—it's important to consider several possibilities:

1. **Dental issues:** Impacted or infected wisdom teeth can cause jaw pain and sometimes refer pain to the neck.
2. **Lymphadenopathy:** Swollen lymph nodes in the neck due to infection or other causes can present as a lump and cause discomfort.
3. **Thyroid or other neck masses:** A lump near the trachea could be a thyroid nodule, cyst, or other mass.
4. **More serious causes:** Given your family history of cancer and smoking, a thorough evaluation is essential to rule out malignancy.

**Recommendations:**
- See a healthcare provider promptly for a full physical exam.
- A dental evaluation to assess the wisdom tooth.
- Imaging studies such as an ultrasound of the neck to characterize the lump.
- Possibly a referral to an ENT specialist or an oncologist for further evaluation.
- Avoid smoking to reduce risk factors.

If you develop worsening pain, difficulty swallowing or breathing, fever, or rapid growth of the lump, seek emergency care immediately.

Early evaluation is key to diagnosis and appropriate treatment.","The patient's presentation includes:

- Right lower jaw pain possibly related to the wisdom tooth.
- Mild neck and throat discomfort, especially on swallowing.
- Pain worsened by turning the head to the left.
- A palpable small lump near the esophagus or trachea, felt on swallowing.
- Symptoms present for about two months.
- Strong family history of cancer.
- Smoker.
- No cough or fever.
- Mild sore throat localized to the lump.

**Analysis:**

1. **Wisdom tooth pain** can explain the jaw discomfort but does not typically cause a palpable lump in the neck or throat area.

2. **Neck lump palpable on swallowing** suggests a lesion related to the thyroid gland or a structure closely associated with the trachea or esophagus.

3. **Pain on turning the head** suggests involvement of neck muscles or structures adjacent to the lump.

4. **Mild sore throat and lump with no systemic symptoms** (no fever, no cough) makes infectious causes like abscess or lymphadenitis less likely.

5. **Smoking and family history of cancer** raise suspicion for malignancy.

6. The lump is not visible externally but palpable internally on swallowing, which is characteristic of a **thyroid nodule or thyroid cancer**.

7. The duration (2 months) and absence of systemic symptoms suggest a subacute process, possibly neoplastic.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

- **Thyroid nodule or thyroid cancer (e.g., papillary thyroid carcinoma)** presenting as a thyroid mass causing local discomfort and referred jaw pain.

**Additional considerations:**

- The jaw pain could be referred pain or coincidental wisdom tooth discomfort.
- Neck pain exacerbated by head movement can be due to local inflammation or mass effect.
- Smoking increases risk for head and neck cancers, including thyroid malignancies.

**Recommended next steps:**

- Urgent neck ultrasound to characterize the lump.
- Fine needle aspiration biopsy if indicated.
- Dental evaluation for wisdom tooth.
- Referral to ENT or endocrinology for further assessment.

Have a good day.","Given your symptoms—right lower jaw pain likely related to your wisdom tooth, mild throat discomfort when swallowing, neck pain when turning your head, and a palpable lump near your throat/esophagus area—it's important to consider several possibilities:

1. **Dental issues:** Impacted or infected wisdom teeth can cause jaw pain and sometimes refer pain to the neck.
2. **Lymphadenopathy:** Swollen lymph nodes in the neck due to infection or other causes can present as a lump and cause discomfort.
3. **Thyroid or other neck masses:** A lump near the trachea could be a thyroid nodule, cyst, or other mass.
4. **More serious causes:** Given your family history of cancer and smoking, a thorough evaluation is essential to rule out malignancy.

**Recommendations:**
- See a healthcare provider promptly for a full physical exam.
- A dental evaluation to assess the wisdom tooth.

"Working out 3 weeks ago doing dead lift dropped bar and got a hit of pain on right side, kept working out, when I got home and bent down had shortness of breath and pain, went to Chiro and got therapy, got deep tissue massage and finally a muscle relaxer took it away, now 5 days later it is back and have done nothing?","Your symptoms—pain on the right side after a deadlift injury, followed by shortness of breath and recurring pain—could suggest a musculoskeletal injury such as a muscle strain, rib injury, or possibly irritation of the intercostal muscles or nerves. The return of pain after initial improvement raises concern for incomplete healing or a possible underlying issue like a rib fracture, intercostal muscle strain, or even a mild lung-related problem (e.g., pleuritis) given the shortness of breath.

**Recommendations:**
- Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity until evaluated.
- Seek prompt medical evaluation, ideally with a primary care physician or sports medicine specialist.
- Imaging (like a chest X-ray or rib series) may be needed to rule out rib fractures or lung issues.
- If you experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or fever, seek emergency care immediately.

Do not ignore recurring pain and shortness of breath—professional assessment is important to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.","The patient's history suggests a traumatic injury during deadlift with subsequent pain on the right side, followed by shortness of breath and pain after bending down. Initial improvement with conservative therapy was followed by recurrence of pain without new trauma.

Most likely diagnosis: **Rib fracture with possible associated pleural injury (e.g., pneumothorax or hemothorax)**.

Rationale:
- Dropping a heavy bar on the right side can cause rib fractures.
- Pain on the right side and shortness of breath after bending down suggests possible pleural involvement.
- Recurrence of pain without new trauma may indicate incomplete healing or complications such as a delayed pneumothorax or pleural irritation.
- Chiropractic therapy and massage may temporarily relieve muscle spasm but do not address underlying bone or pleural injury.

Recommendation:
- Obtain chest X-ray to evaluate for rib fractures and pleural complications.
- Monitor respiratory status closely.

This could be due to a muscle injury, nerve compression, or other underlying problems.

**What you should do:**
- Seek immediate medical attention from a doctor or visit the emergency room.
- Avoid self-medicating with injections, additional painkillers, or sprays without professional advice.
- Rest and avoid any movements that worsen the pain.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Hifenac MR (diclofenac) can increase bleeding risk by inhibiting platelet function.
- Severe worsening of lower back pain and inability to move or walk suggests acute neurological compromise.
- Muscle cramp after massage is unlikely to cause such severe symptoms unless complicated by bleeding or nerve injury.

"My 11 yr old daughter has Chiari 1 malformation and I have seen that canniboid oil has been helping kids with other conditions, my question is has there been any legitimate studies that show if it can help with the pain , insomnia and nausea that are the result of having Chiari and nerve damage ?","Currently, there are no well-established, large-scale clinical studies specifically investigating the use of cannabinoid oil for pain, insomnia, or nausea related to Chiari 1 malformation and associated nerve damage in children. 

However, cannabinoids have been studied more broadly for chronic pain, nausea, and sleep issues in various conditions, with some evidence suggesting potential benefits. Most research is in adults, and pediatric data are limited. The safety and efficacy of cannabinoid products in children, especially for neurological conditions like Chiari malformation, remain unclear.

Because Chiari 1 malformation can cause complex neurological symptoms, it is essential to consult your daughter's neurologist or pain specialist before considering cannabinoid oil. They can provide guidance based on her specific condition, current treatments, and the legal status of cannabinoid products in your area.

In summary:
- No specific, robust studies on cannabinoid oil for Chiari 1 symptoms in children.
- Some evidence supports cannabinoids for pain, nausea, and insomnia in other conditions, mostly in adults.
- Safety and efficacy in children with neurological disorders are not well established.
- Always consult a specialist before starting cannabinoid treatment.

Explanation:
- Chiari 1 malformation involves downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, which can cause compression of neural structures.
- This compression can lead to symptoms such as headache, neck pain, nausea, and neurological deficits.
- Nerve damage or irritation from the malformation can cause neuropathic pain.
- Insomnia may result from chronic pain and neurological dysfunction.

I took 42 radiation treatment for prostate cancer. and now I have cold feet all of the time. I am 84 year old and I have never had cold feet. are there any type of shoes that I should wear. and is this cause by the radiation treatment. My P. S. A test this week was 0.01. THANK YOU.,"Cold feet after radiation treatment for prostate cancer can sometimes be related to nerve or blood vessel changes caused by the radiation, especially if the treatment area included pelvic or lower spinal regions. However, cold feet can also be due to other causes such as circulation problems, diabetes, or age-related changes.

Your PSA of 0.01 is excellent and suggests good control of your prostate cancer.

Regarding shoes, consider:

- Warm, insulated shoes or slippers to help keep your feet warm.
- Shoes with good circulation and cushioning to improve comfort.
- Avoid tight shoes that may restrict blood flow.

It is important to discuss your cold feet with your healthcare provider to rule out other causes like peripheral artery disease or neuropathy. They may recommend further evaluation or treatments to improve circulation or nerve function.

If you experience other symptoms like pain, numbness, or color changes in your feet, seek medical attention promptly.","In an 84-year-old male with a history of extensive radiation therapy for prostate cancer and a very low PSA (0.01, indicating good cancer control), new onset of persistent cold feet is unlikely to be directly caused by the radiation treatment itself.

**Most likely diagnosis:** Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)

**Rationale:**
- Radiation therapy for prostate cancer is localized and typically does not cause systemic vascular symptoms like cold feet.
- Cold feet in an elderly patient are commonly due to peripheral arterial disease, caused by atherosclerosis leading to reduced blood flow.
- Other causes to consider include peripheral neuropathy or venous insufficiency, but coldness is more characteristic of arterial insufficiency.
- Radiation-induced vascular damage is usually localized to the radiation field and would not typically cause bilateral cold feet.
- The very low PSA suggests cancer is well controlled, so paraneoplastic or cancer-related causes are less likely.

**Recommended next steps:**
- Clinical vascular examination (palpate pulses, check capillary refill)
- Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement to assess for PAD
- Doppler ultrasound of lower extremity arteries if indicated
- Manage cardiovascular risk factors (smoking cessation, diabetes control, lipid management)

**Summary:** The patient's cold feet are most likely due to peripheral arterial disease rather than a direct effect of prostate cancer radiation therapy.",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Radiotherapy can damage normal tissues too. And nerves are very much sensitive to radiation. And due to this damage functions of nerves are hampered and sensation they carry are altered. Radiation for prostate cancer can damage pelvic nerves. These nerves supply lower limb. So damage to these can cause cold feet. No specific treatment except it b 12 should be given. Wear soft shoes to prevent further damage.,"An 84-year-old male who underwent 42 radiation treatments for prostate cancer now experiences persistent cold feet, a symptom not present previously.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",model_response_og,model_response_conv,doctor_output,"Cold feet after radiation treatment for prostate cancer can sometimes be related to nerve or blood vessel changes caused by the radiation, especially if the treatment area included pelvic or lower spinal regions. However, cold feet can also be due to other causes such as circulation problems, diabetes, or age-related changes.

Your PSA of 0.01 is excellent and suggests good control of your prostate cancer.

Regarding shoes, consider:

- Warm, insulated shoes or slippers to help keep your feet warm.
- Shoes with good circulation and cushioning to improve comfort.
- Avoid tight shoes that may restrict blood flow.

It is important to discuss your cold feet with your healthcare provider to rule out other causes like peripheral artery disease or neuropathy. They may recommend further evaluation or treatments to improve circulation or nerve function.

If you experience other symptoms like pain, numbness, or color changes in your feet, seek medical attention promptly.","In an 84-year-old male with a history of extensive radiation therapy for prostate cancer and a very low PSA (0.01, indicating good cancer control), new onset of persistent cold feet is unlikely to be directly caused by the radiation treatment itself.

**Most likely diagnosis:** Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)

**Rationale:**
- Radiation therapy for prostate cancer is localized and typically does not cause systemic vascular symptoms like cold feet.
- Cold feet in an elderly patient are commonly due to peripheral arterial disease, caused by atherosclerosis leading to reduced blood flow.
- Other causes to consider include peripheral neuropathy or venous insufficiency, but coldness is more characteristic of arterial insufficiency.
- Radiation-induced vascular damage is usually localized to the radiation field and would not typically cause bilateral cold feet.
- The very low PSA suggests cancer is well controlled, so paraneoplastic or cancer-related causes are less likely.

**Recommended next steps:**
- Clinical vascular examination (palpate pulses, check capillary refill)
- Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement to assess for PAD
- Doppler ultrasound of lower extremity arteries if indicated
- Manage cardiovascular risk factors (smoking cessation, diabetes control, lipid management)

**Summary:** The patient's cold feet are most likely due to peripheral arterial disease rather than a direct effect of prostate cancer radiation therapy.",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Radiotherapy can damage normal tissues too. And nerves are very much sensitive to radiation. And due to this damage functions of nerves are hampered and sensation they carry are altered. Radiation for prostate cancer can damage pelvic nerves. These nerves supply lower limb. So damage to these can cause cold feet. No specific treatment except it b 12 should be given. Wear soft shoes to prevent further damage.,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
i 51/f taking odimont-LC since one year.I used to take one doze daily sometimes when not relived then i increased the doze to two or three.Now i got a problem in legs and joints --- like swelling in joints and thigh adding to this also starting eching .. kindly tell if is is steroid and also tell me about the symptons that i m suffering from??,"Odimont-LC typically contains a corticosteroid (like prednisolone or dexamethasone) combined with other components. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs but can cause side effects, especially with long-term or high-dose use.

Your symptoms of joint and thigh swelling and aching could be related to steroid side effects such as:

- Fluid retention causing swelling (edema)
- Muscle weakness or steroid myopathy
- Joint pain or inflammation
- Possible early signs of steroid-induced osteoporosis or joint issues

It is important to not increase the dose on your own and to consult your doctor promptly. They may need to evaluate your symptoms, adjust your medication, and possibly run tests to rule out other causes like infection or arthritis.

**Summary:**
- Odimont-LC likely contains steroids.
- Your symptoms may be side effects of steroid use.
- Do not self-increase dose; see your doctor urgently for assessment and management.","Odimont-LC is a combination medication that typically contains a corticosteroid (like methylprednisolone or dexamethasone) along with other components. Long-term or high-dose corticosteroid use can lead to several musculoskeletal side effects.

The patient's symptoms of swelling and aching pain in the joints and thighs, especially with occasional increased doses, suggest possible **steroid-induced myopathy** or **steroid-induced arthropathy**. Corticosteroids can cause:

- **Steroid myopathy:** Characterized by proximal muscle weakness and aching, especially in the thighs.
- **Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis):** Can cause joint pain and swelling, commonly affecting hips and knees.
- **Fluid retention and joint swelling:** Due to corticosteroid effects on fluid balance.

Given the history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is **steroid-induced myopathy** or early steroid-related musculoskeletal complications.

**Recommendation:** The patient should avoid increasing doses without medical advice, and a thorough clinical evaluation including physical exam, muscle strength testing, and possibly imaging (MRI for avascular necrosis) or labs (muscle enzymes) is warranted. Consultation with her prescribing physician to adjust steroid dose and consider alternative treatments is important.

**Summary:**  
- Symptoms likely related to corticosteroid side effects.  
- Most likely diagnosis: steroid-induced myopathy or steroid-related joint/muscle complications.  
- Urgent medical review recommended to prevent progression.","Hello, The symptoms in the joints are probably related arthritis. I suggest checking the rheumatoid factor level for further evaluation.

"Hi, I am a her of new born baby boy of 70 days. We had a ultrasound of his head in a normal body check up in Russian, 10 days back. And get to knew that he has extra Cerebrospinal fluid in his head. We do not know the normal baby s measurements of ventricle and fluid quantity. Russian Dr. suggested us to get the treatment for Hydrocephalus. We again get the ultrasound done here in Delhi, India and consulted with pediatrician. He said that sizes of ventricle & head are normal. Hight of baby at the time of birth 56 cm & Weight 4.4 kg Present Hight of baby 67cm & Weight 6.7 kg Please Suggest.","Thank you for sharing the details. Here are some important points to consider:

1. **Ventricular Size and Hydrocephalus Diagnosis:**  
   - Hydrocephalus is diagnosed based on enlargement of the brain ventricles and/or increased head circumference beyond normal growth patterns.  
   - Normal ventricular size varies with age and imaging technique, but mild extra cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can sometimes be a normal variant or transient in newborns.  
   - The pediatrician in Delhi has assessed the ultrasound and found the ventricle size and head growth to be within normal limits, which is reassuring.

2. **Growth Parameters:**  
   - Your baby’s height and weight gain from birth to 70 days are good and within normal ranges, indicating healthy overall growth.

3. **Next Steps:**  
   - If the pediatrician finds no clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure (such as bulging fontanelle, vomiting, irritability, or abnormal head growth rate), immediate treatment for hydrocephalus may not be necessary.  
   - Regular follow-up with head circumference measurements and developmental assessments is important.  
   - If there is any concern about symptoms or head growth, repeat imaging and specialist consultation (pediatric neurologist/neurosurgeon) can be considered.

**Summary:**  
Based on your description, the second pediatrician’s assessment that the ventricle size and head growth are normal suggests no current need for hydrocephalus treatment. Continue regular pediatric follow-up and monitor your baby’s development and head size. If you notice any concerning symptoms, seek prompt medical advice.

If you want, I can help you with normal ventricular size ranges or signs to watch for.","The most likely diagnosis is **benign external hydrocephalus (benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces)** or a normal variant of increased extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in infancy.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- The initial ultrasound suggested extra CSF, which can sometimes be misinterpreted as hydrocephalus.
- Follow-up ultrasound and pediatric evaluation in Delhi showed normal ventricle size and head circumference, arguing against true hydrocephalus.
- The infant is growing well with normal length and weight gain, indicating no clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure or developmental delay.
- Benign external hydrocephalus is common in infants and often resolves spontaneously without treatment.

In summary, the infant likely has a benign condition with extra CSF that does not require intervention, rather than true hydrocephalus. Continued monitoring of head growth and development is appropriate.","Hi, What is more important to know for me is the present head circumference of the baby. If it was normal at birth, by 70 days I expect around 38 CMS. Anyhow, the pediatrician you last met has seen the baby and said the head size and repeat USG is normal-so no need to worry now. Just see the doctor after 3 months to measure the head size once again. It's common to have some minor abnormality in ultrasound taken soon after birth, and becoming normal when repeated after 68 weeks-nothing to worry here.

im 16 and i have had this red bump in my lip lower lip and well 8th grade my lip would get dry and i would peel the bottom of my lower lip and then after peeling it and then started bleeding i had a red bump in my lower lip is there any way it can ge,"It sounds like the red bump on your lower lip may be related to repeated irritation and trauma from peeling and picking at dry, cracked skin. This can cause inflammation, small sores, or even a minor cyst or mucocele (a mucus-filled bump) to form.

To help it heal and prevent it from worsening:
- Avoid peeling or picking at your lips.
- Keep your lips moisturized with a gentle lip balm (preferably fragrance-free and hypoallergenic).
- Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.
- Avoid licking your lips, as saliva can dry them out further.

If the bump persists for a long time, grows, becomes painful, or bleeds frequently, it’s best to see a healthcare provider or dermatologist. They can examine it and determine if any treatment is needed, such as medication or minor procedures.

If you want, I can help you with tips on lip care or when to seek medical attention.","The most likely diagnosis is **angular cheilitis with secondary irritation or a mucocele**.

Key points supporting this:
- Chronic dryness and peeling of the lower lip suggest **chronic lip irritation or inflammation**.
- Occasional bleeding indicates mucosal fragility.
- The development of a red bump could represent a **mucocele** (a mucous cyst caused by trauma to minor salivary glands) or an inflamed area from chronic irritation.
- Angular cheilitis (inflammation at the corners of the mouth) often coexists with lip dryness and fissuring but the red bump on the lower lip itself is more consistent with a mucocele.

Other considerations:
- Herpes simplex virus infection usually presents with painful vesicles rather than a persistent red bump.
- Actinic cheilitis is less common in adolescents and usually presents with scaling and atrophy rather than a red bump.
- Allergic contact cheilitis can cause dryness and peeling but less commonly a localized red bump.

"Hi, Early today (labor day) I painted my room with the doors and windows up with Valspar Ultra. After about 2 hours of painting I began to feel fatigued and became queasy. About an hour later I began to vomit in a quick succession about 4 times. Now I m feeling a bit better but I want to know if the paint fumes were enough to cause this reaction or, do you believe I ve ingested some and need to go to a hospital? Thanks~","Your symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and vomiting after painting in a closed room with Valspar Ultra paint are likely due to inhalation of paint fumes, which can cause irritation and mild poisoning. Valspar Ultra paints often contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can cause these symptoms, especially in poorly ventilated areas.

If you did not intentionally ingest paint, it is unlikely you swallowed a significant amount. However, inhaling fumes in a closed space can cause the symptoms you described.

**Recommendations:**
- Immediately move to fresh air and ventilate the room thoroughly.
- Drink water to stay hydrated.
- Rest and monitor your symptoms.
- If you develop worsening symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting, confusion, dizziness, or loss of consciousness, seek emergency medical care promptly.

If symptoms improve with fresh air and hydration, hospital visit may not be necessary. However, if you are concerned or symptoms persist, it is safest to get evaluated by a healthcare professional.","The patient's symptoms—fatigue, nausea, and multiple episodes of vomiting after about two hours of exposure to paint fumes—are consistent with acute inhalational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and solvents commonly found in paints like Valspar Ultra. These symptoms can occur due to irritation and mild systemic toxicity from inhaling paint fumes in a poorly ventilated environment.

**Key points:**
- Symptoms developed after prolonged inhalation exposure.
- No mention of paint ingestion.
- Improvement after cessation of exposure.
- Paint fumes can cause nausea, headache, dizziness, and vomiting.

Hi. I have had head pains for the past year. They are pulse short pains that happen when I strain or laugh. They usually last 3 to 7 pulses and then are completly gone. Also the past three weeks I have had a pea sized knot right on my hair line around where the head pains are. I have a doctors appoint next week but I am so nervous. Does it sound very serious?,"Your symptoms of brief, pulsing head pains triggered by straining or laughing, along with a small knot on your hairline, could be related but are not necessarily serious. The knot might be a cyst, a benign lump, or an inflamed hair follicle, which are often harmless but can cause localized discomfort. The short, pulsing pains triggered by strain could be related to tension headaches or nerve irritation.

However, it's important to have a healthcare professional evaluate the lump and your symptoms to rule out any serious conditions. Since you already have a doctor's appointment scheduled, that is the best step. If you experience worsening pain, neurological symptoms (like weakness, vision changes, or confusion), or rapid growth of the lump before your appointment, seek medical attention sooner.

Try to stay calm—many causes of your symptoms are manageable and not dangerous. Your doctor will provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.","The patient's symptoms of brief, pulsatile head pains triggered by straining or laughing, combined with the recent development of a small knot at the hairline near the pain site, suggest **Occipital Neuralgia with an associated occipital nerve schwannoma or neuroma**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- **Pulsatile, short-lived head pains** lasting a few pulses are characteristic of neuralgic pain.
- **Triggers like straining or laughing** increase intracranial or muscular pressure, often exacerbating nerve irritation.
- The **pea-sized knot at the hairline** corresponds anatomically to the course of the greater occipital nerve, suggesting a localized nerve lesion such as a schwannoma or neuroma causing nerve irritation.

Other considerations like primary headache disorders (e.g., migraine) are less likely given the localized knot and the nature of the pain.

**Recommendation:** Imaging (MRI) of the occipital region to evaluate the knot and nerve involvement, and referral to neurology or neurosurgery for further management.","Hi, If I were your treating Doctor for this case of this head lump, I would come up with only one and one possibility that is a sebaceous cyst!

Soo.. can u pls help me.. and please tell me that is it communicable and can harm my family members..? For this what are the precautions i will have to take..! I will be highly thankful to u!,"Hello! I can help you with that.

**Tests for Abdominal or Intestinal Tuberculosis:**
1. **Tuberculin Skin Test (Mantoux test)** – to check for TB infection.
2. **Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs)** – blood test for TB infection.
3. **Chest X-ray** – to check for pulmonary TB, which often accompanies abdominal TB.
4. **Abdominal Ultrasound or CT scan** – to detect abnormalities in the intestines, lymph nodes, or peritoneum.
5. **Endoscopy or Colonoscopy with biopsy** – to obtain tissue samples from the intestines for histopathology and culture.
6. **Ascitic fluid analysis** (if fluid is present in the abdomen) – for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining, culture, and PCR for TB.
7. **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)** – to detect TB DNA in tissue or fluid samples.
8. **Stool tests** – sometimes used to detect TB bacteria.

**Is Abdominal Tuberculosis Communicable?**
- Abdominal TB itself is usually not contagious because it is a form of extrapulmonary TB.
- Pulmonary TB (lung TB) is the contagious form, spread through airborne droplets when a person coughs or sneezes.
- However, if you have active pulmonary TB along with abdominal TB, you can transmit TB to others.

**Precautions:**
- If you have pulmonary TB, avoid close contact with family members until you are on treatment and no longer contagious.
- Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing.
- Ensure good ventilation in living spaces.
- Follow your doctor’s treatment plan strictly.
- Family members may need screening for TB.

If your doctor suspects abdominal TB, these tests will help confirm the diagnosis. Please follow up with your healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment.

Feel free to ask if you need more information!","The most likely diagnosis is **abdominal (intestinal) tuberculosis**.

### Diagnostic Tests for Abdominal Tuberculosis:
1. **Imaging:**
   - Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan to identify lymphadenopathy, bowel wall thickening, ascites, or masses.
2. **Microbiological Tests:**
   - Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining and culture of ascitic fluid, biopsy specimens, or lymph node aspirates.
   - PCR (GeneXpert MTB/RIF) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA detection in tissue or fluid samples.
3. **Histopathology:**
   - Biopsy of affected intestinal tissue or lymph nodes showing caseating granulomas.
4. **Tuberculin Skin Test (Mantoux) or Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRA):**
   - Supportive but not definitive for active abdominal TB.
5. **Ascitic Fluid Analysis:**
   - High protein, lymphocytic predominance, and elevated adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels.

### Communicability and Risks to Family Members:
- **Abdominal tuberculosis is generally not contagious** because it is a form of extrapulmonary TB.
- The primary source of transmission is **pulmonary tuberculosis**, which spreads via airborne droplets.
- If the patient has no active pulmonary TB, the risk of transmission to family members is very low.
- Family members should be screened for latent or active pulmonary TB if there is concern about exposure.

### Precautions:
- Standard hygiene and infection control measures.
- No special airborne precautions are needed unless pulmonary TB is present.
- If pulmonary TB is diagnosed, respiratory isolation and treatment are necessary to prevent spread.

**Summary:** Abdominal TB diagnosis relies on imaging, microbiology, and histopathology. It is not contagious like pulmonary TB, so family risk is minimal unless pulmonary involvement exists.","HelloAbdominal tuberculosis can be classified into the Tubercular mesenteric amenities, intestinal tuberculosis, mental or tubercular peritonitis. The first investigation is blood test which can show increased ESR with raised lymphocytes count. Then a USG should be done to find out any enlarged and matted lymph node, thickening or adhesion of the intestinal wall or any collection of fluid. The next investigation may be CENT abdomen for better delineation of anatomic abnormality or if USG is doubtful. Sometimes there may be formation of cold abscess or mass, then aspiration of pus or USG guided biopsy of mass may be needed. The pus should be sent for test of tuberculosis.

"my daughter is 4 yrs old..she got hurt on her mouth `15 days back and her front teeth also bleeded..my pediatrician gave antibiotic adcef,ibujesic plus ..used it for 5 days...it got healed..now am findin tht her teeth is gettin darker..wht may b the problem","The darkening of your daughter's front tooth after trauma is likely due to internal bleeding or pulp damage inside the tooth, a condition called pulp necrosis. When a tooth is injured, the blood supply can be disrupted, causing the tooth to turn gray, brown, or dark.

This is a common complication after dental trauma, especially in young children. It is important to have her evaluated by a pediatric dentist as soon as possible. The dentist may take an X-ray and assess the tooth's vitality to determine if treatment like a root canal or other intervention is needed to save the tooth and prevent infection.

In summary:
- Darkening tooth after trauma suggests pulp damage.
- Needs prompt dental evaluation.
- Early treatment can improve outcome.

Please schedule a pediatric dental visit soon.","The most likely diagnosis is **pulpal necrosis** of the affected front tooth.

Explanation:
- Trauma to the tooth and surrounding tissues can disrupt blood supply to the pulp.
- This leads to pulp death (necrosis), causing the tooth to darken or discolor over time.
- The initial bleeding and healing followed by darkening is typical of pulp necrosis after trauma.

Recommendation:
- The child should be evaluated by a pediatric dentist.
- Radiographic examination and pulp vitality tests are needed.
- Treatment may involve root canal therapy or other interventions to preserve the tooth.","Hello thanks for sharing your query, as soon as trauma strike teeth the blood vessels and nerves gets within tooth gets injured resulting in pain and bleeding from the tooth...slowly blood supply to the tooth stops resulting in dead pulp/necroses pulp , now this necrotic pulp causes dark discoloration of the tooth.if the tooth is intact its advised not to extract it but only removal of the necrotic pulp and go for a prosthetic crown over it...take care ...","A 4-year-old child sustained an oral injury to the mouth involving bleeding of the front teeth 15 days ago.

"Hi, My mom is suffering from nasopharyngeal carcinoma from Aug 2011. When we diagnosed the disease the doctor informed that she is in Stage IV. After Chemotherapy and Radiotheraphy treatments, the doctor told that the disease is not present in the body right now (Feb 2012). Afterwards she was good till last May 2012. Afterwards she is suffering from fever , not able to eat food properly, breathing problems, etc.. Are these side-effects of the treatment ? or Anything going wrong on her body. Please provide me your suggestions. Thanks in Advance. Regards, Suresh (India)","Hello Suresh,

I'm sorry to hear about your mom's health issues. Given her history of Stage IV nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the symptoms she is experiencing now—fever, difficulty eating, and breathing problems—are concerning and should be evaluated promptly.

While some side effects of treatment can persist or appear later (such as mucositis, fibrosis, or immune suppression), new symptoms like fever and breathing difficulties may indicate infection, recurrence of cancer, or other complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Medical Evaluation:** Please take your mom to her oncologist or a healthcare facility as soon as possible for a thorough clinical assessment.
2. **Diagnostic Tests:** The doctor may order imaging (CT/MRI/PET scan), blood tests, and possibly a biopsy to check for recurrence or infection.
3. **Symptom Management:** Fever and breathing problems require urgent attention to rule out infections or other serious conditions.
4. **Nutritional Support:** Difficulty eating should be addressed with a nutritionist or supportive care team.

Do not delay seeking medical care, as early diagnosis and treatment of any complications or recurrence are crucial.

Wishing your mom a speedy recovery.","Given the patient's history of stage IV nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and a disease-free status as of February 2012, the new onset of fever, poor oral intake, and breathing difficulties starting in May 2012 is concerning.

**Key points:**
- Fever suggests an infectious or inflammatory process.
- Poor oral intake and breathing difficulties could be due to local recurrence, infection, or treatment-related complications.
- Treatment side effects (from chemo/radiotherapy) typically occur during or shortly after treatment, not several months later.
- Late complications can include fibrosis, strictures, or secondary infections, but fever is less common as a direct side effect.

**Most likely diagnosis:**
- **Infectious complication** such as aspiration pneumonia or an upper respiratory tract infection, possibly due to immunosuppression or local anatomical changes post-treatment.
- **Tumor recurrence or progression** causing airway obstruction and systemic symptoms.
- Less likely but possible: radiation-induced necrosis or secondary malignancy.

**Recommended next steps:**
- Urgent clinical evaluation including physical exam, chest imaging (X-ray or CT), and possibly nasopharyngeal endoscopy.
- Laboratory tests including CBC, inflammatory markers, and cultures.
- Consider biopsy if recurrence is suspected.

"Daughter has akathesia caused by reglan and compozine.  This has been on going for one month.  it has caused disassociation, anxiety, memory loss, tremors, out bursts of anger.  looking for help on how to treat her.  quality of life poor, never had issues until those meds were given.","I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's condition. Akathisia caused by medications like Reglan (metoclopramide) and Compozine (likely a brand of prochlorperazine) can be very distressing and may lead to symptoms such as anxiety, restlessness, tremors, and mood changes.

Here are important steps to consider:

1. **Immediate Medical Evaluation:** She needs to be evaluated promptly by a healthcare professional, preferably a neurologist or psychiatrist familiar with drug-induced movement disorders.

2. **Discontinuation or Dose Adjustment:** The offending medications (Reglan and Compozine) should be discontinued or reduced under medical supervision, as continued use can worsen symptoms.

3. **Symptomatic Treatment:** Medications such as beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol), benzodiazepines, or anticholinergic agents (e.g., benztropine) are sometimes used to relieve akathisia symptoms, but these must be prescribed by a doctor.

4. **Supportive Care:** Addressing anxiety, mood symptoms, and cognitive issues may require psychological support or medications.

5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regular follow-up is essential to monitor symptom progression and response to treatment.

Please seek urgent consultation with her prescribing physician or a specialist to develop a safe and effective treatment plan. If symptoms are severe or worsening, consider emergency care.","The most likely diagnosis is **metoclopramide- and prochlorperazine-induced akathisia with associated neuropsychiatric symptoms**, possibly evolving into **tardive akathisia or a drug-induced movement disorder with neuropsychiatric manifestations**.

Explanation:
- Metoclopramide and prochlorperazine are dopamine antagonists commonly associated with extrapyramidal side effects, including akathisia.
- Akathisia typically presents with restlessness and an urge to move, but chronic exposure can lead to additional neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, and mood changes.
- The presence of dissociation, memory loss, tremors, and outbursts of anger suggests involvement beyond simple akathisia, possibly indicating a more severe or prolonged drug-induced movement disorder or neuropsychiatric syndrome.
- These symptoms developed after starting the medications and were not present before, supporting a drug-induced cause.

The dizziness, vomiting, and slurred speech are concerning signs consistent with a stroke. It is important that your friend receives appropriate medical care, including blood pressure management and physical therapy as recommended.

- High altitude can cause hypoxia, leading to increased sympathetic activity and elevated blood pressure.
- Elevated blood pressure at altitude can increase the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.
- The diagnosis of a mild stroke locally supports a cerebrovascular event.

I have a lump on the left side of my shoulder a little near my neck inside the collarbone. When it first happened 3 days ago my collarbone and my neck hurt...I wonder where it comes from and there is not any more real pain but I take ibuprofen....What should I do??? It seems like it will go away but I don t know.,"A lump near the collarbone and neck with initial pain could have several causes, including swollen lymph nodes (due to infection or inflammation), a cyst, muscle strain, or less commonly, other growths.

Since the pain has decreased but the lump remains, you should:

1. Monitor the lump for changes in size, tenderness, or if it becomes red or warm.
2. Avoid pressing or irritating the area.
3. Continue taking ibuprofen as directed for any discomfort.
4. Seek medical evaluation if the lump:
   - Grows or does not improve within 1-2 weeks
   - Becomes increasingly painful, red, or warm
   - Is associated with other symptoms like fever, night sweats, weight loss, or difficulty swallowing/breathing

A healthcare provider can perform a physical exam and may order imaging or blood tests to determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment. If you develop new or worsening symptoms, seek prompt medical attention.","The presentation of a recent lump near the left shoulder, close to the neck and inside the collarbone, initially painful but now painless, suggests a few possibilities. The most likely diagnosis is a **lymphadenopathy** (enlarged lymph node), possibly reactive due to a recent infection or inflammation.

Key points supporting this:
- Location near the neck and collarbone corresponds to common lymph node sites (supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes).
- Recent onset with initial pain that resolved is typical of reactive lymph nodes.
- Use of ibuprofen suggests initial inflammation or pain.

Other considerations:
- **Clavicular bone injury or fracture** (less likely without trauma).
- **Lipoma or benign soft tissue tumor** (usually painless and slow-growing).
- **Infection or abscess** (would likely remain painful and possibly show systemic signs).
- **Malignancy (e.g., lymphoma or metastatic node)** (less likely with rapid onset and pain resolution but should be considered if lump persists or grows).

**Recommendation:** Monitor the lump for size changes, tenderness, or systemic symptoms.

If I were your doctor, I would do a general physical examination of yours with special attention to your head and neck region along with the oral cavity, and would consider advising you for a short course of broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti-inflammatory ","A lump near the collarbone and neck with initial pain could have several causes, including swollen lymph nodes (due to infection or inflammation), a cyst, muscle strain, or less commonly, other growths.

Since the pain has decreased but the lump remains, you should:

1. Monitor the lump for changes in size, tenderness, or if it becomes red or warm.
2. Avoid pressing or irritating the area.
3. Continue taking ibuprofen as directed for any discomfort.
4. Seek medical evaluation if the lump:
   - Grows or does not improve within 1-2 weeks
   - Becomes increasingly painful, red, or warm
   - Is associated with other symptoms like fever, night sweats, weight loss, or difficulty swallowing/breathing

A healthcare provider can perform a physical exam and may order imaging or blood tests to determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment. If you develop new or worsening symptoms, seek prompt medical attention.","The presentation of a recent lump near the left shoulder, close to the neck and inside the collarbone, initially painful but now painless, suggests a few possibilities. The most likely diagnosis is a **lymphadenopathy** (enlarged lymph node), possibly reactive due to a recent infection or inflammation.

Key points supporting this:
- Location near the neck and collarbone corresponds to common lymph node sites (supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes).
- Recent onset with initial pain that resolved is typical of reactive lymph nodes.
- Use of ibuprofen suggests initial inflammation or pain.

Other considerations:
- **Clavicular bone injury or fracture** (less likely without trauma).
- **Lipoma or benign soft tissue tumor** (usually painless and slow-growing).
- **Infection or abscess** (would likely remain painful and possibly show systemic signs).
- **Malignancy (e.g., lymphoma or metastatic node)** (less likely with rapid onset and pain resolution but should be considered if lump persists or grows).

**Recommendation:** Monitor the lump for size changes, tenderness, or systemic symptoms. If it persists beyond 2-3 weeks, enlarges, or other symptoms develop, further evaluation with imaging (ultrasound) and possibly biopsy may be needed.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
"I am facing from quite wierd problems, i am blank all the time , i tend to forget things just like 30 - 40- secs after it , while studying , i just keep copying thin gs from blackboard , and camnt even ermeber what was the nlast line i wrote , even if i study constantly for 6 hrs or do a heavy workout , i neither feelk fresh or tired , its the same black and dizzy mind , i have lost my identity , i dont know how to respond to phone calls, i mean what to speak , when i go to shops , i am always confused what to buy , i am feeling sleepy whole day and cant think of anything , this has effected my personal as well as social life very negitively , is this fatique or nanxiety disorder or what ?","Your symptoms—persistent memory problems, difficulty concentrating, feeling mentally blank and dizzy, confusion, excessive sleepiness, and impaired social functioning—are concerning and could be due to several possible causes, including:

1. **Severe fatigue or burnout**  
2. **Anxiety or depression** (both can cause cognitive impairment and low energy)  
3. **Sleep disorders** (poor sleep quality can cause daytime sleepiness and cognitive issues)  
4. **Nutritional deficiencies** (e.g., vitamin B12, iron)  
5. **Thyroid dysfunction**  
6. **Neurological conditions**  
7. **Other medical issues** (e.g., infections, chronic illnesses)

Given the severity and impact on your daily life, it is very important to see a healthcare professional promptly. They can perform a thorough evaluation, including history, physical exam, and necessary tests (blood work, mental health assessment) to identify the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment.

If you experience worsening symptoms, suicidal thoughts, or inability to care for yourself, seek emergency care immediately.","The patient's symptoms—marked short-term memory impairment (inability to retain information beyond 30-40 seconds), difficulty recalling recent information, impaired concentration, mental blankness, dizziness, persistent cognitive dysfunction unaffected by rest or exercise, daytime sleepiness, confusion in social and decision-making contexts, and significant functional impairment—are not typical of simple fatigue or anxiety disorder alone.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or an early neurocognitive disorder**, possibly due to an underlying neurological or medical condition (e.g., early dementia, metabolic or structural brain disorder).

**Rationale:**  
- Fatigue and anxiety can cause concentration difficulties and memory complaints but usually improve with rest or treatment and do not cause profound short-term memory loss to this degree.  
- The inability to retain information beyond 30-40 seconds suggests a working memory or encoding deficit, which is characteristic of organic cognitive impairment rather than purely psychiatric causes.  
- Daytime sleepiness and dizziness may indicate an underlying medical or neurological disorder affecting brain function.  
- The persistence and severity of symptoms with functional decline point toward a neurocognitive disorder.

**Recommended next steps:**  
- Comprehensive neurological and cognitive evaluation (including neuropsychological testing).  
- Brain imaging (MRI) to rule out structural causes.  
- Laboratory tests to exclude metabolic, infectious, or inflammatory causes.  
- Assessment for sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) given daytime sleepiness.

If anxiety or depression is present, it may be comorbid but does not fully explain the cognitive profile described.

**Summary:** The clinical picture is most consistent with an early neurocognitive disorder rather than fatigue or anxiety alone. Prompt specialist evaluation is warranted.","Hi dear, what ever you described is suggestive of depression or negative schizophrenia, but actual diagnosis is not possible without detail history and mental status examination. Hows your mood and your interest regarding your work?sleep and appetite habit?is there any fear or auspiciousness in your behavior ? Consult psychiatrist for detail history and treatment. There are many medications which is helpful and so not to worry about it. Thank you","The patient reports persistent cognitive difficulties including an inability to retain information beyond 30 to 40 seconds, difficulty recalling recent written content, and impaired concentration during study sessions. This cognitive impairment is accompanied by a sensation of mental blankness and dizziness, with no variation in mental fatigue or refreshment despite prolonged study or heavy physical exercise. The patient also experiences daytime sleepiness and confusion in social interactions and routine decision-making, leading to significant negative effects on personal and social functioning. The patient wonders if these symptoms represent fatigue, an anxiety disorder, or another condition. What is the most likely diagnosis?",,,,,,,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
