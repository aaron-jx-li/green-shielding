0,"I am a 66-year-old man who recently visited my physician due to a three-month history of fatigue. I have a medical history that includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and I experienced a transient ischemic attack three years ago. On average, I consume three beers daily, occasionally having a couple more on social occasions. 

During my appointment, I was taking several medications, including aspirin, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. My vital signs showed a temperature of 37.1°C, a pulse of 78, respirations at 19 per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on room air. Although I did not appear to be in distress, I noticed that I had marked pallor and multiple pinpoint, red, non-blanching spots on my extremities. 

Upon examination, my physician palpated my abdomen and found that my spleen was significantly enlarged. Following the examination, I underwent laboratory studies, which revealed a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 80,000/mm3, and a platelet count of 34,000/mm3. Additionally, a blood smear indicated the presence of immature cells with large, prominent nucleoli and pink, elongated, needle-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions.",A. Cirrhosis B. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia C. Chronic myelogenous leukemia D. Myelodysplastic syndrome E. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia F. Acute myelogenous leukemia,F,Acute myelogenous leukemia,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) — specifically acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, M3) is strongly suspected.

Why: the peripheral smear shows immature myeloblasts with prominent nucleoli and Auer rods (pink, needle‑shaped cytoplasmic inclusions), which are characteristic of AML (classically seen in APL). Your clinical picture (fatigue, pallor, petechiae, splenomegaly, anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and very high WBC) fits acute leukemia and places you at high risk for bleeding (and for DIC in APL) and leukostasis with very high leukocyte counts.

Immediate next steps (urgent):
- Urgent hematology/oncology referral and hospital admission.
- Stop aspirin and any other antiplatelet/anticoagulant agents because platelet count is very low and bleeding risk is high.
- Obtain bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry/cytogenetics (including testing for t(15;17) PML‑RARA) to confirm the diagnosis and subtype.
- Check coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, D‑dimer), basic metabolic panel, uric acid, LDH, and blood cultures as indicated.
- If APL is suspected clinically, start all‑trans retinoic acid (ATRA) promptly (before cytogenetic confirmation) because early treatment reduces risk of fatal coagulopathy.
- Supportive care: platelet transfusions as needed for bleeding or very low platelets, red‑cell transfusion for symptomatic anemia, aggressive monitoring/treatment for DIC, and tumor‑lysis prophylaxis (IV fluids, allopurinol/rasburicase) with frequent labs.
- Consider leukapheresis if there are signs of leukostasis (respiratory or neurologic compromise) from hyperleukocytosis.

Definitive therapy will depend on the specific AML subtype and molecular findings (APL: ATRA ± arsenic trioxide; other AMLs: anthracycline-based induction and consolidation ± stem cell transplant depending on risk). Please present to the ER or hematology immediately.",Cirrhosis,True,True,True,True,True
1,"I am a 27-year-old woman who recently sought care in the emergency department due to a left-sided headache and blurry vision in my right eye. Two weeks prior, I experienced dark urine and abdominal pain, which I initially attributed to a urinary tract infection. To address it, I took some leftover trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Although I intended to visit my primary care physician today, the onset of my headache and vision problems prompted me to come to the emergency department instead.

I consider myself generally healthy, but I do have a family history of sickle cell trait in my brother. During the examination, the doctor noted mild tenderness in my abdomen, and they felt my liver edge extending 4 cm below the right costal margin. 

Afterward, several tests were conducted. As the medical team worked to assess my condition, they informed me that a Doppler ultrasound of my liver showed decreased blood flow in the right hepatic vein. Additionally, they mentioned that a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of my brain was pending. I remain focused on understanding the cause of my symptoms and awaiting further evaluation.",A. Anti-histone antibodies B. Bone marrow biopsy C. Flow cytometry D. Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase levels E. Hemoglobin electrophoresis,C,Flow cytometry,neutral,"What the ED findings mean (short version)
- The Doppler result (decreased flow in the right hepatic vein) is consistent with hepatic vein thrombosis—Budd–Chiari syndrome—which explains your RUQ/abdominal pain and enlarged liver.
- Your recent dark urine plus new headache and visual changes are concerning for simultaneous venous thrombosis elsewhere (for example cerebral venous sinus thrombosis can cause headache and visual disturbance) and/or hemolysis. Taken together, a process that causes both intravascular hemolysis and unusual venous clots is high on the differential.

Most likely possibilities to explain your picture
- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): classic triad is hemolytic anemia with dark urine, abdominal pain/hepatomegaly from hepatic vein thrombosis, and a high risk of atypical venous thromboses (hepatic, portal, cerebral). PNH is an important consideration here.
- Other causes of a hypercoagulable state that can produce hepatic and cerebral vein thromboses: antiphospholipid syndrome, myeloproliferative disease (JAK2 mutation), inherited thrombophilias (Factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation, protein C/S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency), and estrogen/OCP use or pregnancy. 
- A separate possibility for the dark urine only: drug‑induced hemolysis from trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole in someone with G6PD deficiency — that would explain hemolysis but would not by itself explain hepatic vein thrombosis.

What your team should (and likely will) do next
Urgent/short-term actions
- Get MRI/MR venography of the brain (you said MRI brain is pending) to look for cerebral venous thrombosis.
- Start therapeutic anticoagulation urgently (typically heparin) unless there’s a bleeding contraindication — hepatic vein thrombosis and suspected cerebral venous thrombosis are treated with anticoagulation.
- Involve hematology and hepatology/interventional radiology early for anticoagulation, consideration of thrombolysis, thrombectomy, or TIPS if needed.

Important tests to confirm diagnosis and find the cause
- Hemolysis workup: CBC, reticulocyte count, LDH, indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, peripheral smear, urinalysis (heme/hemoglobin); direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test.
- PNH test: flow cytometry for loss of CD55/CD59 on red cells and granulocytes (this is the key test if PNH is suspected).
- Thrombophilia workup: antiphospholipid antibody panel, JAK2 mutation, Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A, protein C/S, antithrombin levels (many centers do these after the acute phase or on hematology guidance).
- Pregnancy test and medication history (including OCPs) and smoking history.
- If TMP‑SMX–triggered hemolysis is suspected, check G6PD level (but note G6PD level may be normal during acute hemolysis; discuss timing with hematology).

Potential treatments beyond immediate anticoagulation
- If PNH is confirmed: complement‑inhibitor therapy (eculizumab or ravulizumab) is the specific treatment to reduce hemolysis and thrombotic risk; hematology will advise.
- For refractory or severe Budd–Chiari: interventional procedures (angioplasty, stenting, TIPS) or surgical shunts may be needed.
- Supportive care: transfusion if needed, pain control, monitoring for liver failure.

What you can do now
- Stay in the hospital for the pending MRI and blood tests and for initiation of anticoagulation as recommended.
- Do not take hormonal contraceptives until the cause is clarified.
- Tell your team about the trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole use and any family history of clotting disorders or hemolytic anemias.

Bottom line
You have evidence of hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd–Chiari) and symptoms suggesting another venous clot in the brain plus recent dark urine that suggests hemolysis. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an important unifying diagnosis to consider urgently, but other hypercoagulable conditions must be evaluated. Your current priorities are MRI/MRV of the brain, urgent anticoagulation, and hematology consultation with blood tests including flow cytometry for PNH.

2,"I am a 58-year-old white man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Over the past three months, I noticed a painless lesion on my lower lip, which prompted me to visit my physician. I have a long history of smoking, consuming one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Additionally, I have worked as a fruit picker for the last 25 years. 

During my examination, the physician looked closely at my oral cavity and identified a single ulcer located near the vermillion border of my lip. I am currently taking medications, including captopril for my hypertension and metformin for my diabetes. Given these circumstances, I am seeking a diagnosis for the lesion that has developed on my lip.",A. Squamous cell carcinoma B. Herpes labialis C. Pemphigus vulgaris D. Aphthous stomatitis E. Actinic keratosis F. Traumatic ulcer G. Basal cell carcinoma,A,Squamous cell carcinoma,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lower lip.

Why: SCC of the lower lip is common in older men with long tobacco use and chronic sun exposure (you work outdoors). It typically appears as a persistent, painless, indurated ulcer near the vermillion border. Your other meds (captopril, metformin) are not typical causes of a chronic lip ulcer.

Next steps (urgent):
- Arrange an urgent evaluation by a dermatologist, oral/maxillofacial surgeon, or ENT.  
- Obtain a tissue diagnosis (biopsy — incisional or excisional depending on lesion size).  
- On confirmation, staging (examination of regional lymph nodes; imaging such as neck CT/MRI or PET/CT if nodes or larger lesion) and definitive treatment (usually surgical excision with clear margins — Mohs or wide local excision; neck dissection or radiotherapy if nodal disease or high-risk features).

What to watch for:
- Any new or enlarging lesion, bleeding, induration/rolled margins, or palpable neck nodes — report immediately.

Practical advice:
- Stop smoking, use lip sun protection (broad-spectrum SPF, hat), and keep follow-up appointments.

3,"This morning, I experienced two episodes of red urine, which prompted me to visit the emergency department for evaluation. I did not have any pain while urinating, but I noticed that I had lower back pain and a fever. About six months ago, I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my right knee, which I manage by taking 1 to 2 tablets of ibuprofen daily. 

I have been a smoker for the past 45 years, consuming about one pack of cigarettes each day, but I do not drink alcohol. Upon arrival at the hospital, my temperature was recorded at 38.5°C (101.3°F), my pulse was at 95 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg. 

During the physical examination, the doctor noted a faint, diffuse maculopapular rash and bilateral flank pain. The rest of the examination did not reveal any abnormalities. I understand that my urinalysis showed significant blood, some protein, and a notable number of red blood cells, although no casts were found. Numerous eosinophils were also present. I am now awaiting further assessment and a diagnosis based on these findings.",A. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis B. Acute pyelonephritis C. Acute glomerulonephritis D. Crystal-induced acute kidney injury E. Renal cell carcinoma F. Henoch–Schönlein purpura G. Acute tubular necrosis,A,Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), most likely drug‑induced from ibuprofen.  
  Why: the classic triad of fever + rash + eosinophils in the urine (eosinophiluria) strongly points to AIN, an immune‑mediated inflammation of the renal interstitium often caused by antibiotics, NSAIDs, PPIs and other drugs. Your urinalysis (blood, protein, many RBCs, eosinophils, no casts) and flank pain fit this picture.

Other possibilities (less likely given the findings)
- Pyelonephritis/UTI — can cause fever and flank pain but would more typically show pyuria, positive urine culture and not eosinophiluria or diffuse rash.  
- Glomerulonephritis — usually has RBC casts and more significant proteinuria.  
- Nephrolithiasis or urinary tract malignancy (bladder/kidney cancer) — these can cause gross hematuria, but they do not explain the rash, fever, and eosinophils; however, your long smoking history means cancer should be considered if hematuria persists or other features point that way.

Immediate recommended actions
1. Stop ibuprofen (and any other nonessential medications) immediately.  
2. Blood tests now: serum creatinine, BUN, electrolytes, CBC (look for peripheral eosinophilia), liver tests.  
3. Urine studies: urine culture, urine microscopy (repeat for casts/WBCs), urine protein quantification (protein/creatinine ratio).  
4. Renal ultrasound to exclude obstruction if clinically indicated.  
5. Consult nephrology promptly. If renal function is worsening or diagnosis is uncertain, a renal biopsy may be needed to confirm AIN.  
6. If AIN confirmed and renal function is significantly impaired or not improving after stopping the drug, corticosteroid therapy (typically prednisone) is often used to speed recovery; this should be guided by nephrology.

Prognosis and follow up
- If the offending drug is stopped early, many patients recover kidney function over days–weeks to months, but delayed recognition can produce permanent damage.  
- Because you smoke, persistent hematuria after resolution of the acute picture should prompt evaluation for malignancy (urology workup including cystoscopy/urine cytology as appropriate).

If you like, tell me the current serum creatinine, urine culture result (if available), and whether your urine continues to be red — I can help prioritize next steps and what to expect from nephrology.",Renal cell carcinoma,True,True,True,True,True
4,"I am a 67-year-old man who recently visited my primary care physician due to persistent lower abdominal pain that has been constant and gnawing for the past two days. The pain has been progressively worsening in intensity. At times, I notice that it radiates to my lower back and groin on both sides. I haven’t been able to pinpoint any specific factors that make the pain worse, but I find some relief when I flex my knees.

My medical history includes well-controlled hypertension, and I have been a smoker for 35 years, consuming 40 to 50 cigarettes daily. During my examination, the physician found a palpable pulsatile mass just to the left of midline below my umbilicus. Following this finding, I was referred for further management. However, while being transferred, I experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and became unresponsive.",A. Diverticulitis B. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage C. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm D. Appendicitis E. Irritable bowel syndrome,C,Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,neutral,"This history is most consistent with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

Why: men >65 who smoke and have hypertension are at high risk. The classic triad for a ruptured AAA is sudden severe abdominal/back pain, a palpable pulsatile abdominal mass, and hypotension/syncope — all of which you describe. Radiation to the groin/back and brief relief with knee flexion are also commonly reported.

What this means now
- A ruptured AAA is a life‑threatening surgical emergency. Rapid blood loss into the abdomen or retroperitoneum causes shock and can lead to death within minutes to hours without definitive repair.
- Immediate goals are rapid control of bleeding by vascular surgery (open repair or endovascular repair if available) and stabilizing circulation with blood products and careful resuscitation.

Immediate actions (if this is happening now)
- Call emergency services/911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately.
- On arrival, the ED will place large-bore IVs, start blood typing/crossmatch and transfusion, provide limited IV fluids (permissive hypotension, e.g., target systolic ~80–100 mmHg until surgical control), and summon vascular surgery and anesthesia urgently.
- If unstable, there is no time for CT — the patient goes straight to the operating room. If briefly stable, a CT angiogram may be done to plan endovascular repair.

Prognosis and prevention
- Mortality for ruptured AAA is high (many patients die before reaching hospital; in‑hospital mortality remains substantial). Rapid recognition and immediate surgical care offer the best chance.
- Men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked are recommended to have a one‑time abdominal ultrasound screening to detect asymptomatic AAAs. Smoking cessation markedly reduces risk progression.

If you’re not already in care: go to the nearest ER or call emergency services now. If you are in hospital, ask to speak immediately with vascular surgery and the trauma/acute care team. If you’d like, tell me whether you are currently stable or already in the ED or hospital and I can suggest what to expect next.",Gastrointestinal hemorrhage,True,True,True,True,True
5,"I am a 32-year-old woman who recently visited the emergency department due to severe headaches and pain in my eyes. These symptoms began about two weeks ago and have progressively worsened. Initially, I experienced sharp headaches primarily on the right side, which interfered with my sleep and did not respond to any pain medications. The pain was localized around my right eye and cheek. I also noticed double vision when looking to the right.

Alongside these symptoms, I felt increasingly fatigued and developed a fever, with a temperature reaching 101°F. I noticed swelling around my right eye, which worsened about two days later when swelling appeared around my left eye as well. I have a medical history of a recent rhinosinusitis infection.

During the examination, I was found to have drooping eyelids (ptosis), bulging eyes (proptosis), and swelling around both eyes (chemosis). There was increased sensitivity in the areas supplied by the trigeminal nerve. The examination also revealed signs of increased pressure in my eyes (papilledema), and I experienced weakness in my eye muscles, which affected my ability to move my eyes in all directions.",A. Acute angle-closure glaucoma B. Bacterial endophthalmitis C. Cavernous sinus thrombosis D. Orbital cellulitis E. Preseptal cellulitis,C,Cavernous sinus thrombosis,neutral,"Your story is highly suggestive of cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) — a rare but life‑threatening complication of facial or sinus infection. The combination of recent rhinosinusitis, fever, severe unilateral then bilateral periorbital pain and swelling, proptosis/chemosis, papilledema, and multiple cranial nerve deficits (III, IV, V1/V2 sensory changes, VI palsy) is classic for CST.

Why this is urgent
- CST can rapidly lead to blindness, meningitis, brain abscess, sepsis, or death without prompt treatment.  
- It requires immediate hospital evaluation and aggressive therapy.

What needs to happen now (urgent steps)
1. Go to the nearest emergency department immediately if you are not already there.  
2. Diagnostic imaging: contrast-enhanced MRI with MR venography or CT venography to confirm a thrombus in the cavernous sinus.  
3. Blood cultures and laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, coagulation studies, inflammatory markers).  
4. Empiric broad‑spectrum IV antibiotics started promptly (to cover Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and anaerobes; typical regimens are guided by local protocols and ID consultation).  
5. Specialist involvement urgently: Infectious disease, Neurology/Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, and ENT (for possible drainage of sinonasal source).  
6. Anticoagulation (usually heparin) is frequently considered to limit thrombus extension — this is done under specialist guidance and after imaging/labs.  
7. Supportive care: airway/vision monitoring, elevation of head, control of fever/pain.

Typical causes
- Spread of infection from paranasal sinuses, face, or orbit through venous channels to the cavernous sinus.

Common complications
- Permanent vision loss, intracranial extension (meningitis/abscess), septic emboli, long-term cranial nerve deficits, death.

The physician noted cervical lymphadenopathy and observed multiple violaceous plaques on my trunk and extremities. A fundoscopic examination revealed granular yellow-white opacities around my retinal vessels, along with several areas of dot-blot hemorrhages. My CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was measured at 36/mm3. Given these findings, I was informed that a diagnosis was being considered based on my symptoms and medical history.",A. Cytomegalovirus retinitis B. Herpes simplex keratitis C.

Why: painless, progressive vision loss and floaters in a patient with advanced AIDS (CD4 36/mm3) plus fundoscopic appearance of fluffy, granular yellow‑white perivascular retinal lesions with dot‑blot hemorrhages (“pizza‑pie” appearance) is classic for CMV retinitis.

Immediate next steps:
- Urgent ophthalmology consult (same day). CMV retinitis is sight‑threatening.
- Start anti‑CMV therapy without delay: oral valganciclovir (induction then maintenance) or IV ganciclovir if severe/absorption issues; intravitreal ganciclovir or foscarnet can be used for sight‑threatening lesions (macula/optic nerve).
- Continue/optimize antiretroviral therapy (ART), but do not delay CMV treatment; be aware of possible immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).
- Monitor CBC and renal function (ganciclovir causes marrow suppression; foscarnet is nephrotoxic). Treat until lesions are controlled and CD4 >100/mm3 for a sustained period (typically maintenance until CD4 recovery).

Over the past week, I had been admitted to the hospital twice for shortness of breath and abdominal pain but left the next day each time. I do not smoke or drink alcohol, but I do use intravenous heroin. For the last two weeks, I have been living in a homeless shelter after being evicted from my apartment due to unpaid rent.

When I arrived at the emergency department, my vital signs showed a slightly elevated temperature and a normal pulse and blood pressure. I was reluctant to have a physical examination of my chest. While the physician evaluated my condition, I noticed numbness in my arm and insisted on being admitted to the ward. However, the next day, I left the hospital without informing anyone.",A. Conversion disorder B. Factitious disorder C. Malingering D. Illness anxiety disorder E. Somatic symptom disorder,C,Malingering,neutral,"The pattern in this vignette is most consistent with malingering — intentional production or gross exaggeration of symptoms motivated by clear external incentives (temporary shelter, access to medical care/drugs, avoidance of obligations). Clues: active IV drug use and recent homelessness (clear secondary gains), multiple recent ED admissions with short stays and leaving without notice, dramatic symptom report (“I’m having a heart attack”), reluctance to be examined, sudden new neurological symptoms at the time of evaluation, then early unannounced departure.

Important caveats and recommended approach
- Always rule out life‑threatening organic causes first (treat chest pain as cardiac/respiratory until proven otherwise): ECG, serial troponins, chest imaging, vitals, appropriate labs and a focused exam. In an IV drug user also consider infective endocarditis and pulmonary embolism.
- If workup is negative and malingering is suspected, document findings and the patient’s behavior clearly and nonjudgmentally.
- Avoid unnecessary invasive testing driven by inconsistent history; use a single clinician or small team to limit repeated evaluations.
- Address underlying needs that likely motivate behavior: involve social work/housing services, offer addiction treatment and harm‑reduction resources, and plan for safe discharge if they leave AMA.
- If the patient is high risk for self‑harm, overdose, or severe medical illness, consider holding for observation or hospital admission as clinically indicated.

The rest of the examination did not show any abnormalities.",A. Cholesterol embolism B. Traumatic subungual hemorrhage C. Malignant melanoma D. Onychomycosis E. Squamous cell carcinoma,C,Malignant melanoma,neutral,"Thanks — this is a helpful summary. Short answer: your night sweats could be from a number of benign or serious causes. Given your age, smoking history, recent cardiac history, and the new skin lesion by the toenail, I would recommend a focused evaluation now rather than simply waiting.

Reasonable next steps (history, exam, and initial tests)
- Focused history to tell your clinician: current smoking status (do you still smoke? if yes—how much), any cough/hemoptysis, night-time flushing or hot flashes, sleep disturbance/snoring/daytime sleepiness (suggestive of OSA), any fevers, drenching sweats, recent infections, new medications or changes, travel or TB exposure, new lumps or bruising.
- Focused exam: careful lymph node and spleen check, inspect the skin lesion by the toenail (photo/dermatology evaluation), full lung and breast/chest exam.
- Initial tests to consider now:
  - CBC with differential and basic metabolic panel
  - ESR and/or CRP (inflammation)
  - TSH (hyperthyroidism can cause sweating)
  - HIV test (if risk factors/uncertain)
  - Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or PPD if TB exposure risk
  - If you’re a current smoker or quit within the last 15 years: low‑dose chest CT (LDCT) — you meet USPSTF criteria for annual lung‑cancer screening (age 50–80 and ≥20 pack‑years). If not eligible, a chest x‑ray is reasonable as a first check for obvious abnormalities.
  - Dermatology referral ± biopsy of the toenail lesion (any new or changing pigmented periungual lesion should be evaluated — subungual melanoma is uncommon but important to exclude).
  - If sleep symptoms: consider overnight sleep study for obstructive sleep apnea.
  - Additional tests later if indicated: blood/urine cultures, CT chest/abdomen, or referral to oncology/infectious disease if red flags.

Likely causes to consider (based on your history)
- Menopausal/vasomotor symptoms (less likely to start de novo at 65 but possible)
- Obstructive sleep apnea (you are overweight and hypertensive)
- Medication-related (less likely with the meds you listed)
- Infectious (TB, chronic infections, HIV) — check exposure and testing
- Malignancy (lung cancer given smoking history; lymphoma; melanoma for the toe lesion) — needs imaging and lesion biopsy if suspicious
- Endocrine (hyperthyroidism)

Other immediate recommendations
- If you still smoke: quit now — ask your doctor about counseling, nicotine replacement, or pharmacotherapy.
- Control cardiovascular risk factors — your BP looks slightly high; follow-up to optimize control.
- Get the toenail lesion checked promptly (dermatology or your PCP) and request the LDCT screening if you qualify.

When to seek urgent care
- New fever, rapid weight loss, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, rapidly enlarging lymph nodes, or a rapidly changing/painful skin lesion.

If you like, tell me whether you currently smoke and whether the toe lesion is pigmented or has changed recently, and I can help prioritize which tests should come first.",Malignant melanoma,False,True,False,False,True
9,"I was brought to the emergency department after being hit by a car. At that time, I was intoxicated and had walked into oncoming traffic. When I arrived, I was unconscious, and my Glasgow coma scale score was 3. I have a history of multiple admissions for alcohol intoxication and pancreatitis. 

The medical team started resuscitating me with fluid and blood products. An initial trauma survey showed that I had minor scrapes and abrasions, but there was also some instability in my pelvis. They placed my pelvis in a binder for support. After further resuscitation, I became responsive and indicated that I was in pain, for which I was given medications to help manage it. 

About an hour later, I began to experience numbness around my mouth and in my extremities.

Medication complication D. Transfusion complication E. Trauma to the spinal cord,D,Transfusion complication,neutral,"Most likely cause: acute hypocalcemia from citrate in the transfused blood (citrate chelates ionized calcium). This is common during massive or rapid transfusion and presents with perioral numbness and distal paresthesias, plus possible hypotension, prolonged QT/arrhythmia, tetany or seizures.

Why it happens
- Citrate anticoagulant in stored blood binds ionized calcium → sudden drop in biologically active Ca2+.
- Alcoholism and recent pancreatitis can predispose you to low calcium/magnesium, making symptoms worse.

What the team should do immediately
1. Check an ionized calcium level (and magnesium, basic metabolic panel) and continuous cardiac monitoring (ECG for QT, arrhythmias).
2. Give IV calcium:
   - Adults: calcium gluconate 1–2 g IV over 5–10 minutes (preferred peripherally).
   - If central access and severe instability, calcium chloride 500–1000 mg (1 g) IV over a few minutes (more potent, more irritant peripherally).
   - Repeat as needed based on symptoms and ionized Ca; consider a continuous calcium infusion if ongoing transfusion/bleeding.
3. Treat contributing issues: stop or slow transfusion if possible, correct hypomagnesemia (repleting magnesium is often necessary to correct hypocalcemia), control bleeding.
4. Reassess clinical signs and labs; continue cardiac monitoring until ionized calcium and symptoms normalize.

Alternate considerations
- Respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation can also cause perioral tingling by lowering ionized calcium; differentiate by history, ABG, and lab values. But given recent blood product administration, citrate-induced hypocalcemia is most likely.",Medication complication,True,False,False,True,True

Osteosarcoma commonly arises in the metaphysis around the knee and produces characteristic X‑ray findings (mixed lytic/sclerotic lesion with aggressive periosteal reaction such as Codman triangle or a “sunburst” pattern).

Recommended next steps: urgent referral to an orthopedic oncology team for prompt MRI of the knee (to assess local extent), chest CT (to evaluate for pulmonary metastases), and a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment (usually neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± surgery).

11,"I am a 20-year-old college student, and for the past three weeks, I have been feeling extremely sad. I find myself crying constantly, which has affected my daily life. This emotional struggle began after my boyfriend, with whom I had been for four years, left me. Since then, I have lost my appetite and noticed a weight loss of about 2.3 kg (5.1 lbs). My sadness has made it difficult for me to attend classes, as I often cannot stop crying or get out of bed.

I frequently think about my ex-boyfriend, which adds to my distress. I remember experiencing similar symptoms after previous breakups, lasting about two months each time. I stand at 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and currently weigh 45 kg (100 lbs), giving me a BMI of 18 kg/m². When I visited the physician, my vital signs were within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), pulse of 65/min, and blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg. During the examination, I appeared sad and cried easily, reflecting my emotional state.",A. Borderline personality disorder B. Bereavement C. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood D. Persistent depressive disorder E. Major depressive disorder F. Acute stress disorder G. Anorexia nervosa,C,Adjustment disorder with depressed mood,neutral,"I’m sorry you’re going through this — what you describe is a common and understandable reaction to a painful breakup, but it’s also clearly interfering with your life and needs attention.

What this might be
- Normal grief/reaction to loss: intense sadness, crying, trouble sleeping/eating and difficulty functioning are all common after a breakup. Grief often improves over weeks to months.
- Major depressive episode: if you have five or more depressive symptoms (depressed mood, loss of interest, weight/appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, psychomotor change, suicidal thoughts) for at least 2 weeks and it significantly impairs functioning, a diagnosis of major depression is appropriate and treatment is recommended.
- Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is another possibility when emotional distress is out of proportion to a stressor and causes impaired functioning.

Why this matters now
- You’ve lost weight and your ability to attend classes and get out of bed is affected — that level of impairment warrants professional help.
- You mentioned similar episodes after past breakups, which could mean you’re vulnerable to recurrent depressive episodes.

What to do next (immediate steps)
1. Safety check: If you have any thoughts of harming yourself or not wanting to live, seek immediate help — call emergency services or your local crisis line (in the U.S. call 988). Tell a trusted person where you are and how you’re feeling.
2. Get evaluated: Make an appointment with a primary care doctor or a mental health professional (psychologist, psychiatrist, counselor). They will assess whether this is grief, depression, or another condition and recommend treatment.
3. Short-term supports you can try now:
   - Reach out to friends/family and let them know you need support.
   - Try small daily routines: regular meals, short walks, and consistent sleep times.
   - Avoid using alcohol or drugs to cope.
   - Consider campus counseling services — many colleges offer free or low-cost counseling.
4. Treatment options that may be recommended:
   - Psychotherapy (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) is effective for grief and depression.
   - Antidepressant medication (usually an SSRI) may be recommended if a depressive episode is diagnosed, especially if symptoms are severe or persistent; meds take several weeks to work.
   - Combined therapy + medication is often used for moderate–severe depression.

Monitoring and follow-up
- If symptoms don’t begin to improve over a few weeks, or if they worsen, follow up quickly with a clinician.
- Because your BMI is about 18 and you’ve lost weight, your doctor may want to monitor nutrition and overall medical health.

If you’d like, I can:
- Help you make a short script for talking to campus counseling or your doctor.
- Provide a short self-check quiz (PHQ-9) you can use to track symptoms before your appointment.

12,"I am a 33-year-old man who recently visited the emergency department due to a fever and fatigue. I began feeling unwell after returning from a hiking trip in Alabama. Generally, I am healthy and do not have any other medical conditions. Upon arrival at the emergency department, my temperature was recorded at 101°F (38.3°C). My blood pressure was measured at 127/85 mmHg, my pulse was 108 beats per minute, and my respirations were 14 breaths per minute. I also had an oxygen saturation of 99% while breathing room air.

The physical examination, which included a thorough dermatologic inspection, did not reveal any significant findings. The medical team ordered several laboratory studies to further assess my condition. 

Despite feeling fatigued and having a fever, I did not have any other notable symptoms. I am awaiting the results of the tests to understand what might be causing my current health issues.",A. Babesiosis B. Ehrlichiosis C. Influenza D. Lyme disease E. Rocky mountain spotted fever,B,Ehrlichiosis,neutral,"Thanks — that’s a helpful summary. Based on a febrile illness after a hiking trip in Alabama, the most likely possibilities include tickborne infections (ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), other acute infections (viral illnesses such as influenza or COVID), and less commonly Lyme disease or babesiosis. A normal skin exam does not rule out tickborne disease — many of these can present with only fever and fatigue, especially early on.

What clinicians usually consider and do next
- Likely diagnoses to consider (in order of likelihood for a febrile hiker in the southeastern US): ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii), viral infections (COVID, influenza), early Lyme disease (less common in Alabama), and less commonly babesiosis or other bacterial infections.  
- Typical laboratory studies to help differentiate: CBC (look for leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), basic metabolic panel and LFTs (elevated AST/ALT are common with ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis), blood cultures if bacterial sepsis is a concern, urinalysis, nasal/respiratory PCRs for flu/COVID if respiratory symptoms, peripheral blood smear (can show morulae or parasites), and specific PCR or serologic testing for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma/Rickettsia. PCR results can be rapid; serologies often need a convalescent sample 2–4 weeks later for confirmation.  
- Empiric therapy: In endemic areas, clinicians often start doxycycline empirically for adults when there is a compatible febrile illness after a tick exposure because early treatment reduces complications (this is true for ehrlichiosis and RMSF). Discuss this with the treating team — they can weigh risks/benefits and your test results.  
- Expected timing: incubation for ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis/RMSF is generally within 1–2 weeks after a tick bite. PCR testing may return quickly; serology is delayed.

Questions that would help narrow things down
- When did you return from the trip and when did the fever start?  
- Did you notice or remove any ticks? Any rash, severe headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, or diarrhea?  
- Any recent antibiotics, immune problems, or sick contacts?  
- Have you had COVID/flu testing yet?

When to seek urgent care
- If you develop worsening fever, a new rash, severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fainting, bleeding/bruising, or signs of organ dysfunction — return to the ED immediately.

Next steps I’d expect from the ED/team
- Review the CBC/CMP/LFTs and any rapid viral tests, consider starting doxycycline if concern for tickborne disease, obtain PCR testing for tickborne pathogens and repeat/paired serology as indicated, and arrange follow-up to review results and adjust treatment.

13,"I am a 14-year-old boy who recently experienced several troubling symptoms. For the past three days, I had a fever, general malaise, and severe pain and swelling in my right knee joint. Additionally, I dealt with episodes of abdominal pain and nosebleeds during this time. A few days earlier, I had swelling and pain in my left ankle, but that has since resolved.

Three weeks ago, while camping in the woods, I had a sore throat that was treated symptomatically. I make sure to keep my immunizations up to date. When I visited the physician, my temperature was recorded at 38.7°C (101.6°F), my pulse was 119 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg. Upon examination, the doctor noted that my right knee was swollen and tender, with limited range of motion. I also had painless nodules about 3 to 4 mm in size over my elbows. 

The examination of my blood showed a hemoglobin concentration of 12.3 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 11,800/mm³. The doctor performed an arthrocentesis on my right knee joint, which yielded clear, straw-colored fluid, and no organisms were identified.

""",A,Acute rheumatic fever,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: acute rheumatic fever (ARF) following a recent streptococcal throat infection.

Why: you have several classic features of ARF — a recent sore throat, migratory large‑joint arthritis (ankle then knee), painless subcutaneous nodules over extensor surfaces, fever, and sterile inflammatory joint fluid (low WBC count for septic arthritis, no organisms). These meet the Jones criteria when combined with evidence of a preceding streptococcal infection.

What needs to be done now (urgent):
- Urgent evaluation/admission and cardiology consult to look for carditis (this can be life‑threatening). Obtain an ECG (look for PR prolongation) and an echocardiogram to check valves/heart function.
- Laboratory tests: ASO or anti-DNase B titers, throat culture or PCR for group A strep (may be negative by now), ESR and CRP, CBC, blood chemistries.
- Start antibiotic therapy to eradicate streptococci and prevent recurrence: benzathine penicillin G IM (single dose; dosing by weight — typical adolescent dose 1.2 million units IM). If penicillin allergy, discuss alternatives with your doctor.
- Start anti‑inflammatory treatment for the arthritis: high‑dose aspirin or an NSAID (in children with ARF aspirin is often used; typical high-dose aspirin ~80–100 mg/kg/day divided, or naproxen ~10 mg/kg twice daily — dose and choice should be decided by treating physician).
- If there is moderate–severe carditis or heart failure, glucocorticoids may be indicated.
- Arrange for long‑term secondary prophylaxis (regular benzathine penicillin injections) to prevent recurrences; the duration depends on whether valve disease is present.

Warning signs to seek emergency care immediately: new or worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fainting/syncope, marked worsening swelling or high fever.

14,"I am a 25-year-old man who had been in good health until an incident occurred during soccer practice. About 30 minutes after I collapsed on the field, I was brought to the emergency department. This was particularly concerning for me, as my fatherhad passed away from sudden cardiac arrest at the age of 36. 

When I arrived at the hospital, I was assessed and appeared to be in relatively stable condition. My pulse was recorded at 73 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was measured at 125 over 78 mm Hg. The medical team conducted a cardiac examination, and I underwent an ECG. The results showed large R waves in the lateral leads and deep S waves in leads V1 and V2. 

Given my family history and the nature of my collapse, I understood that further evaluation would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of these findings. The medical staff was attentive and focused on ensuring I received the appropriate care and diagnostics to address my situation.",A. Monoclonal light chain deposition in the myocardium B. Aortic root dilatation C. Eccentric left ventricular dilation D. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy E. Mitral valve fibrinoid necrosis F. Aortic valve calficifaction,D,Asymmetric septal hypertrophy,neutral,"What the ECG suggests
- Large R waves in the lateral leads with deep S waves in V1–V2 commonly reflect left‑ventricular (LV) high voltage. In a young person who collapsed during exertion with a family history of sudden cardiac death, the most important concern is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which classically produces those ECG voltage patterns (and may show abnormal Q waves and T‑wave changes).

Why this matters
- HCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Your collapse plus a first‑degree family history of early sudden cardiac death are red flags that warrant urgent further evaluation.

Recommended next steps (short term)
1. Urgent transthoracic echocardiogram to look for asymmetric septal hypertrophy, wall thickness, outflow obstruction, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.  
2. Cardiology referral (urgent).  
3. Continuous rhythm monitoring (telemetry/24–48 h Holter) to look for ventricular arrhythmias.  
4. Cardiac MRI if the echo is inconclusive or for more detailed anatomy/fibrosis assessment.  
5. Avoid strenuous exercise/competitive sports until cardiology clears you.

Further evaluation and management
- If HCM is confirmed, risk stratification follows (wall thickness, history of arrest/syncope, family history, nonsustained VT on Holter, abnormal BP response on exercise). High‑risk patients may be referred for an implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator (ICD).  
- Genetic testing and family screening are recommended if HCM is found.

Other possibilities (less likely but worth excluding)
- Posterior myocardial infarction can produce deep S / tall R patterns in the anterior leads as a mirror, but that is uncommon in a healthy 25‑year‑old without chest pain/other risk factors.  
- Athletic heart (physiologic LVH) can cause high voltages, but given your syncope and family history it must be excluded.

Much of my day is consumed by thoughts of her, which often distracts me from my daily activities. 

At night, I have experienced episodes where I hear her voice in my sleep, and I sometimes dream about her. During the day, I occasionally have brief glimpses of her, which I believe stems from my feelings of helplessness during her final moments. Despite these overwhelming emotions, I am able to carry out my daily life tasks, and I have never contemplated suicide. However, I often find myself wishing I could be close to my daughter again, as the longing for her remains a significant part of my experience.",A. Brief psychotic disorder B. Major depressive disorder C. Normal grief reaction D. Post-traumatic stress disorder E. Morbid grief reaction,C,Normal grief reaction,neutral,"I’m very sorry for your loss — what you describe sounds like a painful but not uncommon grief reaction. A few points that may help you understand what’s happening and what to do next:

What this most likely is
- Your symptoms (persistent sadness, frequent thoughts about your daughter, dreams and occasional brief “sightings” or sensing her) are consistent with normal/acute bereavement.  
- Hearing her voice during sleep and brief daytime glimpses are common grief phenomena (sensed presence or bereavement-related hallucinations) and are not the same as psychosis when they are transient, not commanding, and you remain reality-oriented.  
- Because you’re still able to carry out daily tasks and have no suicidal thoughts, this does not currently look like major depressive disorder or prolonged grief disorder (which is typically diagnosed only after many months and when symptoms cause marked functional impairment).

What to do now
- Continue follow-up with your psychiatrist and tell them exactly what you described here (frequency, whether the experiences are comforting vs. frightening, and whether they interfere with daily life).  
- Consider grief-focused counseling or a bereavement support group — therapies such as complicated-grief therapy or grief-focused CBT can be very helpful even early on.  
- Maintain routine, social connection, sleep hygiene, regular activity/exercise, and limit alcohol or sedative use (which can worsen mood and hallucination-like experiences). Journaling, memorial rituals, or meaningful ways to honor your daughter can also help process grief.

When to seek more urgent help
Contact your psychiatrist, therapist, or local emergency services right away if you experience:
- Thoughts of harming yourself or a strong wish to die;  
- Voices or visions that are persistent, commanding, frightening, or make you lose touch with reality;  
- Marked decline in ability to care for yourself or to work; or  
- Increasing use of alcohol or drugs to cope.

Expected findings at the 2-month visit
- Fixed flexion (contracture) of the wrist and fingers with a “claw‑like” hand and shortened/atrophic forearm muscles
- Loss of active wrist and finger extension and weak grip (flexor muscle fibrosis/necrosis)
- Tender, firm forearm compartments or visible muscle wasting
- Sensory deficits in the median (and sometimes ulnar) nerve distribution; motor deficits consistent with those nerves
- Peripheral pulses often present (compartment syndrome is a tissue-pressure problem, not always an arterial occlusion)

Brief pathophysiology and implications
- Untreated or delayed compartment syndrome causes ischemic necrosis of forearm flexor muscles; healing with fibrosis produces permanent flexion contractures (Volkmann contracture).
- Early fasciotomy can prevent this; established contracture may require tendon lengthening, fasciotomy, muscle debulking, or reconstructive surgery, but function may be permanently impaired.

Inflammation of the lower esophageal mucosa D. Stretching of Glisson capsule E. Acute inflammation of the pancreas F. Break in gastric mucosal continuity,D,Stretching of Glisson capsule,neutral,"Thank you — this is a thoughtful description. Short answer: your symptoms are most commonly due to reflux or gastritis related to pregnancy, but because you have a prior peptic ulcer and you are 30 weeks pregnant, other causes (peptic ulcer recurrence, biliary disease, pancreatitis, or less commonly pregnancy-related problems such as preeclampsia/HELLP) must be considered. Most causes are treatable, but a few require urgent evaluation. Below is a practical summary and next-step plan.

Likely causes (in order of probability)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)/acid reflux and pregnancy-related gastritis — very common in 3rd trimester due to progesterone and mechanical pressure from the uterus. Night worsening is typical.  
- Recurrent peptic ulcer disease or gastritis (including H. pylori–related) — possible given your history.  
- Biliary disease (gallstones/cholecystitis) — pregnancy increases gallstone risk; pain can be epigastric or right upper quadrant and may be worse after meals.  
- Pancreatitis — less common; causes severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, often with vomiting.  
- Pregnancy-specific: severe upper abdominal/epigastric pain can be a sign of preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome (often with high BP, proteinuria, abnormal liver tests/low platelets) — less likely here because your BP is only mildly elevated and no other signs have been reported, but it should be checked.

Things to check now (simple tests you or your doctor can order)
- Urinalysis for protein (screen for preeclampsia).  
- CBC (to check anemia or infection), LFTs and platelets (to screen for HELLP), and serum lipase (for pancreatitis).  
- Abdominal ultrasound if biliary disease is suspected (RUQ or postprandial pain).  
- H. pylori stool antigen can be done in pregnancy if there is a high suspicion; breath test is typically avoided in pregnancy.

Red flags — go to emergency care right away if you have any of these
- Vomiting blood, black tarry stools, or fainting (possible GI bleeding).  
- Severe uncontrolled pain, high fever, jaundice or signs of infection.  
- Severe headache, visual changes, sudden swelling, or decreased fetal movement (possible preeclampsia).  
- Rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, or signs of dehydration.

Safe initial management options in pregnancy
- Lifestyle/dietary: smaller, more frequent meals; avoid late-night meals; avoid spicy, fatty, acidic foods, caffeine; raise head of bed; avoid smoking and NSAIDs.  
- Antacids containing calcium (Tums) are safe.  
- Sucralfate is safe in pregnancy and can help ulcer-related pain.  
- H2 blockers: famotidine is generally considered safe.  
- Proton pump inhibitors: if symptoms are severe or not controlled by the above, PPIs (e.g., omeprazole) are generally used in pregnancy when needed — discuss with your OB.

What to do next (practical plan)
1. Tell your obstetrician about these symptoms now and request the basic labs listed above (urinalysis for protein, CBC, LFTs, platelets, lipase).  
2. If pain is mainly nocturnal, suggest trying dietary changes + antacid (calcium carbonate) and discuss sucralfate or famotidine with your OB.  
3. If stools are black/there is any bleeding, or if pain worsens/severe, go to the ER.  
4. If labs or clinical course suggest biliary disease or pancreatitis, an abdominal ultrasound and appropriate treatment will be needed.  
5. If H. pylori is suspected and symptoms are persistent/severe, discuss testing (stool antigen) with your provider; definitive eradication therapy is usually deferred to when antibiotics are safer unless required.

Bottom line
Most likely this is reflux/gastritis related to pregnancy and is manageable with lifestyle measures and pregnancy-safe medications. However, because you have a history of peptic ulcer and you are well into the third trimester, it’s reasonable to have a brief workup (urine protein, CBC, LFTs, lipase) and discuss safe medications with your obstetrician. Seek urgent care if you develop bleeding, severe pain, fever, or other “red flag” symptoms.

Acute pancreatitis E. Abdominal aortic aneurysm,D,Acute pancreatitis,neutral,"Based on what you’ve described, the most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis — classic severe mid-epigastric pain radiating to the back, several days duration, inability to find a comfortable position, epigastric tenderness, and risk factors (longstanding hypertriglyceridemia). The absence of jaundice and a negative Murphy’s make gallstones less immediately obvious but do not exclude biliary pancreatitis.

Immediate next steps I would expect your clinicians to take (or that you should ask them to do right away)
- Labs: serum lipase (best test), amylase if lipase not available, basic metabolic panel (electrolytes, BUN/creatinine), liver tests (AST/ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), CBC, fasting triglycerides, blood glucose, calcium, and CRP if available.
- Imaging: right‑upper‑quadrant ultrasound (to look for gallstones/biliary dilation). If diagnosis is uncertain or you’re not improving, contrast CT abdomen can assess severity/complications.
- Initial management: hospital admission, NPO (no oral intake initially), aggressive IV fluids (preferably lactated Ringer’s, guided by vitals and urine output), IV pain control (opioids are commonly used), antiemetics, close monitoring of vitals and urine output, correction of electrolytes and glucose.

Specific issues given your history/meds
- Hypertriglyceridemia: if triglycerides are very high (commonly >1000 mg/dL) this can cause pancreatitis. Treatment options in the acute setting include IV insulin infusion with dextrose (to lower triglycerides) and, for severe cases, plasmapheresis. Check an immediate fasting triglyceride level.
- Medications: DPP‑4 inhibitors (sitagliptin) have been associated rarely with pancreatitis. Your team may hold sitagliptin until the cause is clarified. Fenofibrate is not typically stopped acutely (it lowers triglycerides), but management will depend on the triglyceride result and specialist advice.
- If biliary obstruction or cholangitis is suspected (fever, jaundice, rising bilirubin, or imaging showing stones/ductal dilation), urgent ERCP may be indicated.

Red flags requiring urgent escalation or ICU care
- Low blood pressure or signs of shock, low urine output, worsening respiratory status or oxygen requirement, rising creatinine, high or persistent fever, or worsening abdominal exam — these suggest severe pancreatitis or complications (necrosis, infected fluid collections) and need urgent higher‑level care.

Follow up
- GI consult while hospitalized. After recovery, workup for cause (triglyceride management, consideration of biliary disease with interval imaging or MRCP, review of medications) and long‑term triglyceride control and diabetes management.

Acute stress disorder F. Acute hemorrhagic stroke,A,Conversion disorder,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) causing motor weakness.

Why: you have a psychosocial stressor (recent job loss/isolation), normal head CT/MRI and MR angiography, and exam findings that are internally inconsistent and nonanatomic — e.g., unable to plantarflex when tested supine but able to stand on your toes (automatic/automatic-voluntary dissociation). The focal symptoms don’t fit a single neuroanatomic lesion and objective imaging is normal, which strongly favors a functional (psychogenic) cause over stroke, demyelination, or structural lesion.

What to do next:
- Neurology and psychiatry/psychology involvement for confirmation and to screen for comorbid mood disorders or self-harm risk.
- Explain the diagnosis to you clearly and empathetically (stress that symptoms are real and potentially reversible).
- Start evidence-based treatment: physiotherapy oriented to functional weakness plus psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, physiotherapy-integrated approaches). Treat any coexisting depression/anxiety as indicated.

Pick’s disease,E,Pick’s disease,neutral,"The pattern you describe — new-onset personality and behavioral changes (irritability, disinhibition, poor money management, rude or paranoid behavior) beginning in your 50s, together with early problems with word-finding and planning while basic strength and sensation remain normal — most strongly suggests a frontotemporal dementia, most likely the behavioral variant (bvFTD).

Why this is most likely
- bvFTD typically begins in mid‑life (often 50s–60s) and presents with prominent changes in behavior, social judgment, disinhibition and executive dysfunction early on.  
- Language problems (naming, word‑finding) are also common in FTD spectrum disorders.  
- Memory and MMSE can be relatively preserved in early bvFTD (MMSE 26/30 is consistent).  
- Lack of fever, head trauma, movement disorder, or hallucinations makes infectious, post‑traumatic, or Lewy body causes less likely.

Important alternatives to consider
- Early Alzheimer disease (AD) — usually more prominent short‑term memory loss early and less disinhibition.
- Vascular cognitive impairment — look for stroke history or focal imaging changes.
- Primary psychiatric disorder or medication/metabolic causes — less likely given the late onset and progressive course but must be excluded.

Recommended next steps
1. Neurology referral for confirmation and staging.  
2. Brain MRI (preferred) or CT to look for frontal and/or temporal atrophy (supportive of FTD) and to exclude structural lesions or vascular disease.  
3. Formal neuropsychological testing to define the cognitive profile.  
4. Routine blood tests to exclude reversible causes: CBC, electrolytes, liver & renal function, B12, TSH, fasting glucose/HbA1c, syphilis serology (RPR), and HIV if risk factors.  
5. Consider FDG‑PET or amyloid/tau imaging if available and diagnostic uncertainty remains.

Management and practical advice
- There is no cure, but symptoms can be managed. SSRIs or trazodone sometimes help with disinhibition and irritability. Antipsychotics are reserved for severe agitation and used cautiously. Cholinesterase inhibitors (used for AD) are generally not helpful and can worsen behavior in FTD.  
- Begin planning for legal/financial safeguards (power of attorney) and safety measures at work/home because judgment is affected.  
- Support for family: counseling, social work, local dementia support groups, and occupational therapy can help manage daily living and behavior.  
- Continue good control of vascular risk factors (you already have diabetes — keep it well controlled).

21,"I am a 23-year-old woman who went to the emergency department due to severe abdominal pain that began suddenly several hours earlier and progressively worsened. I have a medical history that includes anxiety and depression, and I take sertraline, sodium docusate, a multivitamin, and fish oil. Currently, I am sexually active with my boyfriend and we use the ""pull-out"" method for contraception.

While in the emergency room, a pelvic ultrasound confirmed I had an ectopic pregnancy. I was scheduled for surgery and treated promptly, although the procedure was complicated by significant blood loss. Afterward, I was placed on IV fluids to aid my recovery.

During my time on the surgical floor, my family came to visit. However, when they learned about my diagnosis, there was a confrontation, and they left angrily. Following this incident, I expressed feelings of distress, stating that I felt like I had “the worst family in the world” and was reluctant to return home.

Prior to my discharge, I noticed I was unable to use my left hand. I felt teary-eyed during the examination, and I had no strength in my left arm, which did not respond to pain. An MRI was performed, but the results were unremarkable. The rest of my neurological exam showed normal findings.",A. Borderline personality disorder B. Conversion disorder C. Factitious disorder D. Ischemic stroke E. Malingering,B,Conversion disorder,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) — i.e., a psychogenic cause of neurological symptoms. It commonly presents in young adults (more often women) with sudden loss of motor or sensory function after a psychological stressor. The symptoms are real to you but are not caused by structural brain disease.

Why this fits your case
- Abrupt, focal left-arm weakness that began after an emotionally charged hospital event (family confrontation/distress).  
- Neurologic exam otherwise normal and MRI unremarkable (no structural lesion to explain a new unilateral palsy).  
- Features suggest a non‑anatomic/inconsistent deficit (e.g., lack of normal pain response and isolated weakness) classically seen with conversion.

Other possibilities that were appropriately considered
- Acute stroke or structural lesion (ruled out by MRI), metabolic/electrolyte disturbance or medication effect (labs can exclude), peripheral nerve injury (exam/imaging/labs can help). Malingering or factitious disorder is less likely given tearfulness and distress.

Recommended next steps
1. Basic medical recheck: CBC (to assess blood loss/anemia), electrolytes, and any other post-op labs as indicated to exclude reversible medical causes.  
2. Neurology follow-up for confirmatory exam and to document positive signs of functional weakness (these clinicians can demonstrate inconsistency objectively).  
3. Early physical rehabilitation/physiotherapy focused on retraining movement — shown to help recovery.  
4. Psychiatric or psychological referral for supportive therapy/CBT and to address the emotional trauma, grief, and family conflict. You already take sertraline — discuss continuation with your prescriber.  
5. Involve social work/support services for discharge planning and to help with family/safety concerns if you are reluctant to return home.

How clinicians should talk with you (what helps)
- Clear, non‑judgmental explanations: say the symptom is real and treatable, explain that stress can produce physical symptoms without structural brain damage, and outline a treatment plan. Avoid implying it’s “all in your head” in a dismissive way.

Prognosis and warning signs
- Many people improve substantially with early rehab and psychological support; recovery timelines vary from days–months.  
- Return to ER immediately if you develop new or worsening focal neurologic signs (slurred speech, vision loss, face droop, worsening weakness, severe headache, fainting) or if you feel suicidal or unsafe.

22,"I am a 73-year-old male, and I was brought to my family practitioner by my daughter due to a spinning sensation I have been experiencing for the past four weeks. The feeling is like the room is continuously spinning, and it has progressively worsened to the point where I am now bed bound and require support to walk. These sensations persist throughout the day and do not change with my position. Alongside the spinning, I have also been experiencing nausea and vomiting.

I do not have any ear pain, discharge, or ringing in my ears, nor have I noticed any hearing disturbances or a feeling of fullness in my ears. I have not experienced any head trauma, fever, or recent flu-like symptoms. When my vital signs were checked, my blood pressure was 133/80 mm Hg, my heart rate was 80 beats per minute, and my respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute. My temperature was measured at 36.7°C (98.2°F). 

During the examination, my extraocular eye movements were normal in all directions; however, a vertical nystagmus was present that did not disappear despite repetitive testing. Hearing tests showed results within normal limits.",A. Acute labyrinthitis B. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo C. Cerebellar tumor D. Meniere's disease E. Vestibular neuritis,C,Cerebellar tumor,neutral,"Most likely explanation: a central cause of vertigo — most concerning for a posterior-circulation (brainstem or cerebellar) stroke — rather than an inner-ear (peripheral) vestibular problem.

Why I think this
- Continuous, progressively worsening spinning for weeks (not brief positional or episodic).
- Age and progressive disability to the point of being bed-bound.
- Vertical nystagmus that is persistent — vertical or purely direction-changing nystagmus is a red flag for a central lesion.
- Normal hearing and lack of ear symptoms (makes peripheral causes like labyrinthitis or Ménière’s less likely).

What to do now (urgent)
1. Go to the emergency department or have immediate neurological evaluation. Posterior-circulation stroke can be life‑threatening or lead to rapid deterioration and needs urgent workup.
2. Urgent brain imaging: MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is preferred to look for posterior fossa ischemia. If MRI is not immediately available, a non-contrast head CT is usually done initially (but CT is less sensitive for early posterior fossa infarcts).
3. Vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) of the head/neck to assess the vertebrobasilar circulation.
4. Stroke team/neurology consult for possible acute ischemic stroke therapies (thrombolysis or thrombectomy) if within treatment windows and appropriate.
5. Admit for monitoring (risk of cerebellar swelling, hydrocephalus), further testing (ECG, cardiac monitoring, labs), and management of vascular risk factors.
6. Symptom care: antiemetic (e.g., ondansetron) and IV fluids as needed. Limit vestibular suppressants (benzodiazepines/anticholinergics) to short-term use only if needed, since they can delay recovery and obscure examination.

Other possibilities (less likely)
- Vestibular neuritis usually produces spontaneous horizontal nystagmus and an abnormal head-impulse test; hearing is usually preserved — but the vertical nystagmus here strongly favors a central cause.
- Tumor or other central lesions could present similarly but are less likely to produce an acute/progressive picture over weeks without other focal signs.

Bottom line: This is potentially serious and requires immediate urgent neurological/imaging evaluation to rule out a cerebellar/brainstem stroke and start appropriate treatment. If you haven’t already been sent to the ED, do so now.",Cerebellar tumor,False,True,True,False,True

Recommended next steps (what the team will/should do)
- Continuous cardiac monitoring for arrhythmias.
- Serial troponins and ECGs.
- Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram to quantify LV function, wall motion abnormalities, and check for pericardial effusion/tamponade.
- If ECG or echo raise concern for coronary injury/ischemia (e.g., regional wall motion abnormality consistent with a coronary territory), consider urgent coronary angiography/CT angiography.
- Supportive management: hemodynamic support (careful fluids, vasopressors/inotropes if needed), treat heart failure signs (diuretics if pulmonary congestion), analgesia, and observation in a monitored setting.

About a month ago, I attended the state fair, where I tried various regional foods, and I began to wonder if my symptoms might be related to something I ate. Additionally, I noticed that my urine had darkened, which I thought could be due to not drinking enough water lately.

I have a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and typically consume 1 to 2 beers daily. As a nursing assistant in a rehabilitation facility, I am usually active, but during this time, I have felt particularly tired.

Active chronic hepatitis B infection D. Resolved acute hepatitis B infection E. Alcoholic hepatitis F. Active hepatitis A infection
""",C,Active chronic hepatitis B infection,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: acute viral hepatitis—most consistent with hepatitis A.

Why: your 2–6 week history after eating fair food, then a prodrome of fatigue, mild fever, nausea/abdominal pain, dark urine and scleral icterus, plus an enlarged/tender liver, is classic for food‑borne hepatitis A. The dark urine and yellowing are from conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and the timing fits HAV incubation. Other possibilities (acute hepatitis B or C, drug‑induced liver injury, obstructive jaundice) are less likely given the exposure history and symptom pattern, but they should be checked.

What to do next (tests your doctor should order)
- Liver panel: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin
- Hepatic synthetic function: PT/INR, albumin
- Hepatitis serologies: IgM anti‑HAV (diagnostic for acute HAV), HBsAg and anti‑HBc IgM (acute HBV), anti‑HCV (and HCV RNA if positive)
- CBC, basic metabolic panel
- Hepatic ultrasound if biliary obstruction is a concern

Immediate care and precautions
- Most HAV infections are self‑limited; management is supportive (rest, hydration, good nutrition).
- Stop alcohol until liver tests normalize. Avoid other potentially hepatotoxic drugs or supplements; discuss whether to hold glyburide with your clinician while liver tests are abnormal.
- If tests show significant coagulopathy (INR >1.5), encephalopathy, or worsening clinical status, urgent referral to hepatology/transplant center is required.
- Hepatitis A is contagious: practice strict hand hygiene, avoid preparing food for others until cleared, and public-health notification may be needed. Close contacts may require postexposure prophylaxis (vaccine or immune globulin) depending on their immunity and timing.

Prognosis and prevention
- Most healthy adults recover completely over weeks to a few months. Vaccination prevents HAV; if you’re not immune, you should be offered vaccination once recovered.

My oxygen saturation was 99% while I was breathing room air. The physical examination revealed that I had predominantly left-sided hearing loss and horizontal nystagmus.

The medical team decided to perform an MRI to further investigate my symptoms. While my initial laboratory tests did not show any abnormalities, I remain uncertain about the underlying cause of my dizziness and hearing issues.",A. Benign positional vertigo B. Glioblastoma multiforme C. Labyrinthitis D. Meniere disease E. Schwannoma,E,Schwannoma,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: acute labyrinthitis (a post-viral inflammation of the inner ear). 

Why this fits
- Your dizziness followed a recent “cold” (viral prodrome is common).
- You have unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus (labyrinthitis affects both the cochlea and vestibular organ; vestibular neuritis causes vertigo without hearing loss).
- The nystagmus is horizontal and you have no other focal neurologic deficits, which points to a peripheral (inner-ear) cause rather than a central brainstem/cerebellar cause.

Why they ordered an MRI
- To exclude central causes of vertigo (stroke, multiple sclerosis) and to look for a cerebellopontine-angle mass such as a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma), which can cause unilateral hearing loss and imbalance. In viral labyrinthitis MRI is usually normal.

Main differential diagnoses (brief)
- Labyrinthitis (most likely)
- Vestibular neuritis (less likely because of hearing loss)
- Ménière’s disease (recurrent episodes of vertigo with fluctuating hearing loss/aural fullness)
- Vestibular schwannoma (usually more gradual hearing loss)
- Central causes (stroke, mass) — MRI is used to evaluate these

Recommended next steps
- Get a formal audiogram (audiology) and ENT follow-up — important to document the type and degree of hearing loss.
- Discuss prompt treatment with your provider: for sudden unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, short course of oral corticosteroids is commonly recommended (best started early). This is often used in suspected labyrinthitis if there is significant hearing loss.
- Symptom control: short-term vestibular suppressants (meclizine, short-term benzodiazepine) and antiemetics if needed. These should not be used long-term because they delay vestibular compensation.
- Begin vestibular rehabilitation (physical therapy for balance) once the acute vertigo subsides to speed recovery.
- Control cardiovascular risk factors (your BP was high in the ED) — follow up with your primary care doctor.

When to seek immediate care
- New or worsening weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, double vision, severe worsening imbalance, or sudden complete loss of hearing — all warrant urgent reassessment.

""",G,"Factitious disorder imposed on another
""",neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: accidental ingestion of a sulfonylurea (oral hypoglycemic) from your mother's diabetes meds (eg, glyburide).

Why:
- You had profound, recurrent hypoglycemia with very high insulin and high C‑peptide during the low-glucose episodes — this pattern indicates endogenous insulin release (vs. exogenous insulin, which gives high insulin with low C‑peptide).
- Sulfonylureas stimulate the pancreas to secrete insulin and commonly cause prolonged/recurrent hypoglycemia in children who swallow an adult dose.
- The low potassium fits because insulin drives K+ into cells, producing hypokalemia.
- Insulinoma in a 5‑year‑old is far less likely; the household exposure to a parent with type 2 diabetes makes accidental sulfonylurea ingestion most plausible.

What clinicians should/do do:
- Confirm with a serum/plasma sulfonylurea assay.
- Continue IV dextrose and cardiac monitoring; replace potassium as needed.
- Consider octreotide to suppress insulin secretion if hypoglycemia is recurrent or prolonged.
- Admit for prolonged observation (sulfonylureas can cause delayed/recurrent hypoglycemia), notify poison control, and screen the home for access to oral hypoglycemics.","Factitious disorder imposed on another

Hepatocellular carcinoma D. Pancreatic cancer E. Colon cancer,E,Colon cancer,neutral,"Based on what you described, the most likely cause is acute ascending cholangitis (a bacterial infection of the bile ducts). Why I suspect that:
- You have the classic Charcot triad: fever, right‑upper‑quadrant (RUQ) pain, and jaundice.
- You also have a positive Murphy‑type exam (pain with RUQ palpation/release) and a palpable liver edge, which fit a biliary problem.
- The acute worsening and systemic signs (fever, pulse 100) support an infective process rather than a simple chronic issue.

What I would expect on the lab tests
- CBC: elevated white blood cell count (infection).
- Liver panel/CMP: cholestatic pattern — elevated total and direct (conjugated) bilirubin, markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT, with milder increases in AST/ALT.
- Blood cultures: may be positive for enteric gram‑negative organisms (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella) or Enterococcus.
- Coagulation tests (PT/INR) and basic metabolic panel to assess severity and liver function.

Important imaging and next steps
- RUQ ultrasound first: to look for common bile duct dilation and gallstones. If ultrasound is inconclusive and suspicion remains, MRCP or CT can be done.
- If cholangitis is confirmed or strongly suspected, urgent biliary decompression (usually ERCP) is often required in addition to antibiotics.
- Initial management in the hospital: NPO, IV fluids, IV broad‑spectrum antibiotics that cover gram‑negative enteric bacteria (choice guided by local protocols), analgesia, and prompt GI/ERCP consult.

Other possibilities (less likely but worth considering)
- Acute cholecystitis (more commonly causes RUQ pain and fever but usually not jaundice unless there’s coexistent obstruction).
- Hepatic abscess or acute viral hepatitis (less likely given jaundice + fever + RUQ exam).
- Obstructing mass in the porta hepatis/pancreatic head (more common in older smokers)—this can present similarly and may be the underlying cause of obstruction.

About the blood coating your stool
- Superficial bleeding (hemorrhoids, fissures) is common with chronic constipation and could explain blood coating stool.
- If bleeding is heavier or persistent, that needs separate evaluation (rectal exam, urgent workup) but is not typical of cholangitis.

What you should do now
- If you haven’t already been sent to the emergency department, call your doctor immediately or go to the ED. Acute cholangitis can progress quickly and often requires inpatient care, IV antibiotics, and urgent biliary drainage.
- Tell the clinicians about your fever, jaundice, RUQ pain, and recent constipation/rectal bleeding so they can prioritize the correct tests and treatment.

Chest pain that radiates to the back in a man in his 60s is a red flag for acute aortic dissection (and also for acute coronary syndrome). Epigastric tenderness with nausea/vomiting can occur with either a dissection that extends into the abdomen or with primary abdominal causes (for example acute pancreatitis), so the clinical context and imaging/labs are needed to decide.

I can’t interpret your CT without the images or the radiology report. If the CT chest was a CT angiogram and showed an intimal flap, a double lumen, or an abrupt contrast cutoff in the aorta, that would confirm a dissection and requires immediate vascular/cardiothoracic evaluation and blood-pressure control. If the CT report instead comments on a normal aorta but shows an inflamed pancreas or peripancreatic fat stranding, that would point to pancreatitis and needs a different treatment path.

Your risk factors (long smoking history, diabetes, prior pancreatitis, obesity) and the lack of abdominal pain make this a leading concern.

What the doctors will likely do next
- Blood tests: liver panel (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, GGT), total and direct bilirubin, CBC, coagulation studies, and basic metabolic panel. These will clarify whether the pattern is cholestatic (expected here).
- Tumor marker: CA 19‑9 can be obtained (not diagnostic alone but may support the picture).
- Imaging: an ultrasound of the right upper quadrant is usually the first imaging test to look for bile-duct dilation or a mass. If obstruction is suspected, a contrast CT scan of the abdomen with a pancreatic protocol or MRCP is typically obtained next to localize and characterize a mass.
- If imaging shows obstruction or a suspicious mass: endoscopic procedures (ERCP for biliary decompression and possible stent placement, and/or endoscopic ultrasound with biopsy) are commonly used for diagnosis and treatment.
- Referrals: gastroenterology and hepatobiliary surgery/oncology will be involved if a mass is found.

Five years prior to this, I had a mole removed from my right forearm, but I hadn't had any other significant skin issues until now. As a retired winemaker, I have spent a considerable amount of time outdoors, which may have contributed to my skin concerns. 

During the examination, my vital signs were taken and found to be within normal limits. The physician noted multiple rough patches on my scalp, which I had not seen before. This prompted a discussion about my symptoms and their potential causes. I am awaiting further evaluation to determine a diagnosis for these skin changes.",A. Seborrheic keratosis B. Basal cell carcinoma C. Keratoacanthoma D. Tinea capitis E. Actinic keratosis F. Bowen disease G. Amelanotic melanoma,E,Actinic keratosis,neutral,"Most likely: actinic (solar) keratoses — rough, scaly patches caused by chronic sun damage. Reasons this fits: your age, long history of outdoor work, new multiple rough/scaly patches on the scalp, and a crusting lesion that reappears after you scrape it.

Why it matters
- Actinic keratoses are common precancerous lesions. Each lesion has a small but real risk of progressing to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) over time, so evaluation and treatment are usually recommended.
- Some lesions can be SCC in situ (Bowen’s disease) or invasive SCC; those require biopsy and definitive treatment.

What to do next
- See a dermatologist for a full skin exam. They may:
  - Perform a biopsy of any lesion that looks suspicious (persistent crusting, rapid growth, ulceration, bleeding, firm/nodular change).
  - Treat confirmed actinic keratoses with cryotherapy or one of several “field” therapies (topical 5‑fluorouracil, imiquimod, topical diclofenac, or photodynamic therapy) depending on number/site.
- If a biopsy shows SCC, surgical removal (excision or Mohs) is usually recommended.

Self-care and prevention
- Use daily broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30+), wear a wide-brimmed hat, and limit peak sun exposure.
- Check your skin and scalp regularly (have someone help with the scalp or see hairdresser/clinician) and take photos to document changes.

Seek prompt care sooner than your scheduled visit if any lesion:
- Grows quickly, bleeds or ulcerates, becomes painful, or becomes fixed to deeper tissue.

I have a medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes, and acute coronary syndrome. During my evaluation, my body temperature was recorded at 97.9°F, and my blood pressure was notably high at 174/114 mmHg, while my pulse rate was 50 beats per minute. 

The physical exam revealed that I was intubated and sedated. I had multiple bruises and a noticeable hematoma on my scalp, indicating trauma from the accident. An ECG was performed to further evaluate my condition.

Why: you have severe head trauma (scalp hematoma, low GCS of 7) after an MVC and the vital-sign pattern (high BP with slow pulse) is classic for increased intracranial pressure causing brainstem compression (Cushing triad). In adults after blunt head trauma, acute subdural hematoma is common (especially if on antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy for prior acute coronary syndrome), although epidural hematoma can also present with rapid deterioration.

Immediate next steps (what your care team should do): urgent non‑contrast head CT to confirm and characterize the bleed, neurosurgical consultation for possible evacuation, measures to control ICP (head elevation, hyperosmolar therapy as indicated), and management of blood pressure and anticoagulation status.",Subarachnoid hemorrhage,False,False,False,False,True

Due to my symptoms, I visited a physician for evaluation. An endoscopy was performed, which revealed multiple shallow hemorrhagic lesions primarily located in the gastric fundus and along the greater curvature of my stomach. The biopsy results indicated a patchy loss of epithelium along with an acute inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria, but it did not extend beyond the muscularis mucosa. 

These findings raised questions about my condition and prompted further discussion regarding the most likely diagnosis.",A. Type B gastritis B. Dieulafoy lesion C. Cushing ulcer D.

Why: the endoscopy shows multiple shallow hemorrhagic lesions (erosions) in the fundus/greater curvature, and biopsy demonstrates epithelial loss with acute inflammatory infiltrate confined to the mucosa (not a penetrating ulcer). The recent coma/head trauma is a classic precipitant of stress‑related mucosal damage.

Suggested immediate steps (brief):
- Acid suppression (IV proton‑pump inhibitor) and close monitoring for recurrent bleeding (vitals, hemoglobin).  
- Endoscopic hemostasis if active bleeding persists.  
- Test for H. pylori (and treat if positive).

34,"I am a 30-year-old woman who recently visited the emergency department due to an episode of chest pain. Until that point, I had been in good health and had never experienced any similar symptoms before. During the onset of the episode, I felt an overwhelming sense that I was going to die. My heart was racing, and I was sweating profusely. I also experienced shortness of breath, which added to my distress.

I cannot recall exactly how long the episode lasted, but I do remember that my symptoms resolved on their own by the time I arrived at the emergency department. Once there, my vital signs returned to normal as I provided my medical history, and I began to feel more calm. 

I do not have any significant past medical history, nor am I currently taking any medications. The physical examination performed by the medical staff did not reveal any abnormalities, and both my electrocardiogram and initial cardiac enzyme tests came back normal.

Average of 1 disruptive event per week C. Disruptive events lasting > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions D. Family history E. Agoraphobia,A,1 month of associated symptoms,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: an acute panic attack (and possibly panic disorder if attacks recur).

Why: your episode had the classic sudden onset of intense fear (“felt I was going to die”), palpitations/tachycardia, sweating, shortness of breath and chest discomfort that resolved spontaneously within minutes to an hour. Normal exam, ECG and initial cardiac enzymes in a healthy 30‑year‑old make an acute coronary syndrome unlikely. The pattern fits DSM‑5 criteria for a panic attack (abrupt surge of intense fear with physical symptoms, peaking within minutes).

What still should be considered or ruled out
- Cardiac causes if symptoms recur or you have risk factors: arrhythmia (ambulatory monitor), ischemia (stress testing) or structural disease (echo) as indicated.  
- Pulmonary embolism if risk factors or ongoing shortness of breath.  
- Endocrine or substance causes: hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma (rare), stimulant/caffeine use, withdrawal from sedatives.  
- Other anxiety disorders or medical mimics if symptoms are atypical or persistent.

Recommended next steps
- Follow up with your primary care provider for a focused history (triggers, frequency, family/psychiatric history) and to review whether further cardiac testing is needed.  
- If attacks recur, consider: psychiatric/psychology referral for diagnosis and treatment planning; ambulatory ECG monitoring if palpitations are prominent; thyroid labs and urine/toxicology if indicated.  
- Treatments: cognitive‑behavioral therapy (especially CBT with exposure/interoceptive techniques) and/or medications (SSRIs/SNRIs for prevention; short‑term benzodiazepines only as needed). Lifestyle measures: reduce caffeine/stimulants, regular sleep, exercise, breathing/grounding techniques.

Immediate self‑help for future attacks
- Slow diaphragmatic breaths (inhale 4 s, exhale 6–8 s), ground with 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 sensory technique, remind yourself symptoms are distressing but not dangerous.

When to seek emergency care again
- Ongoing severe chest pain, fainting, difficulty breathing that doesn’t improve, new neurologic symptoms, or if you’re unsure—go to the ED.

For the past day, I experienced a fever and a productive cough, which included blood in my sputum. Additionally, I felt a sharp pain under my ribs, particularly when I took deep breaths. Over the last two years, I have had multiple episodes of sinusitis and managed these with over-the-counter medications. 

Recently, I started a new job at a wire-mesh factory, which may be relevant to my current health issues. Upon examination, my temperature was recorded at 38.3°C (100.9°F), and my vital signs showed a pulse of 72 beats per minute, respirations at 16 per minute, and blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg. 

The physical examination noted palpable nonblanching skin lesions on my hands and feet. Examination of my nasal cavity revealed ulcerations in the nasopharyngeal mucosa, along with a small septal perforation. During my pulmonary examination, stridor was heard on inspiration.

Positive tuberculin test,A,Increased c-ANCA titers,neutral,"Your symptoms fit a classic presentation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener’s granulomatosis). Key features pointing to this are: recurrent sinus disease with nasal ulceration and a septal perforation, pulmonary involvement with hemoptysis and pleuritic pain (and stridor from possible subglottic involvement), and palpable non‑blanching skin lesions (cutaneous small‑vessel vasculitis). GPA is a small‑vessel, necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis often associated with c‑ANCA / PR3‑ANCA.

What should happen next (urgent):
- Urgent referral/consults: rheumatology, pulmonology, and ENT (for airway evaluation because of stridor/subglottic disease). If airway compromise is suspected, go to emergency care immediately.
- Initial tests to confirm and assess severity:
  - ANCA testing (c‑ANCA / PR3 and p‑ANCA / MPO)
  - Chest x‑ray and chest CT (look for nodules, cavitations, diffuse infiltrates)
  - CT sinus/nasopharynx if not already done
  - CBC, CMP (renal function), ESR/CRP
  - Urinalysis (and urine microscopy) to look for hematuria/proteinuria (renal involvement)
  - Biopsy of an accessible lesion (nasal mucosa, skin, or lung) for histology (necrotizing granulomas + vasculitis is diagnostic)
- If life‑threatening pulmonary hemorrhage, rapidly progressive renal failure, or severe airway compromise are present, treatment is often started promptly (high‑dose glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphamide or rituximab) and sometimes plasmapheresis — decisions made by specialists.

Other possibilities to consider (less likely given the full picture): microscopic polyangiitis (usually no granulomas or destructive nasal lesions), infections (e.g., TB) or drug/cocaine‑related midline destructive lesions, or Goodpasture’s syndrome (anti‑GBM) — but these don’t typically produce the ENT destructive lesions and palpable purpura you have.

Prognosis and implications:
- Untreated GPA can progress rapidly and be life‑threatening (pulmonary hemorrhage, renal failure). With modern immunosuppressive therapy many patients achieve remission but relapses are common and long‑term follow‑up is required.
- Immunosuppressive therapy has important side effects and infection risk, so diagnosis should be confirmed and therapy coordinated by specialists.

Next immediate step: go back to emergency care or arrange urgent specialist evaluation (rheumatology/pulmonology/ENT) today for the tests and airway assessment described above.

Over the past month, I had been feeling increasingly weak, which concerned her. I had no prior health issues and was not taking any medications. My vaccination history was complete.

At the doctor's office, my temperature was measured at 39.5°C (103.1°F). They checked my blood pressure, which was 115/70 mm Hg, and my pulse was 94 beats per minute with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The doctor examined my neck and felt swollen lymph nodes on both sides. I had several small red spots, known as petechiae, on my lower legs and soft palate. They also noted that my spleen was enlarged, as it was palpable about 3 cm below the rib cage.

The physician ordered some tests to better understand my condition, but the details of those results were not discussed with me. I was anxious about what was happening, but I did not fully grasp the significance of the findings at that moment.",A. Acute lymphoid leukemia B. Bacterial sepsis C. Burkitt’s lymphoma D. Infectious mononucleosis E. Aplastic anemia,A,Acute lymphoid leukemia,neutral,"You’ve described a picture that raises strong concern for infectious mononucleosis (most commonly Epstein–Barr virus, EBV), although some other serious conditions must be considered and ruled out.

Why EBV is likely
- Typical features you have: several days of fever, marked fatigue, swollen/tender cervical lymph nodes (often posterior), visible palatal petechiae, and an enlarged spleen. Palatal petechiae and splenomegaly are classically seen in infectious mononucleosis.

Important alternatives to consider
- Acute leukemia (especially if there are easy bruising, widespread petechiae, profound fatigue or very abnormal blood counts) — can present with fever, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and petechiae from thrombocytopenia.
- Other viral infections (CMV, acute HIV) or bacterial pharyngitis with complications.
- Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) causing petechiae with otherwise mild infection.

Key tests that clarify the diagnosis (you should ask your clinician for these results)
- CBC with differential and platelet count (look for atypical lymphocytosis in EBV; low platelets suggest thrombocytopenia/leukemia/ITP).
- Peripheral blood smear (to look for blasts or atypical lymphocytes).
- Heterophile (“monospot”) test and EBV-specific serologies (VCA IgM, VCA IgG, EBNA) to confirm acute EBV infection.
- Liver function tests (mild transaminitis often occurs with EBV).
- If leukemia is suspected: flow cytometry, bone marrow biopsy and urgent hematology referral.

Immediate guidance and red flags
- Avoid contact sports and heavy exertion until spleen size is confirmed to have returned to normal (risk of splenic rupture).
- Supportive care if EBV is confirmed: rest, fluids, acetaminophen for fever/pain; avoid amoxicillin/amoxicillin–clavulanate (can cause a rash in mono).
- Seek urgent care if you develop severe abdominal pain (possible splenic rupture), uncontrolled bleeding, sudden worsening shortness of breath, fainting, or very high/unchanging fever despite treatment.

Throughout my pregnancy, I have been following up regularly with my gynecologist, and so far, everything has been uncomplicated. I do not have any personal or family history of serious illness, and I do not smoke or consume alcohol. The only medications I take are folic acid and a multivitamin.

When I arrived at the emergency department, my temperature was normal, my pulse was 90 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was within a healthy range. During the examination, the doctor noted tenderness in the costovertebral angle on my right side. Given these symptoms and findings, I understood that further evaluation would be necessary to determine the cause of my pain.",A. Lower urinary tract infection B. Ovarian torsion C. Cholecystitis D. Nephrolithiasis E. Pelvic inflammatory disease F. Pyelonephritis G. Appendicitis,D,Nephrolithiasis,neutral,"Your story (sudden, severe colicky right flank pain radiating to the groin, nausea, dysuria and right costovertebral-angle tenderness) is most typical of a ureteral (kidney) stone. Other possibilities include an upper urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis, a lower urinary tract infection, or less likely obstetric or gynecologic causes (appendicitis, ovarian torsion are less likely but considered if the picture changes).

What I would expect the ED to do next
- Urinalysis (dip + microscopy) and urine culture — look for blood (hematuria) and infection.
- Blood tests: CBC, creatinine/electrolytes (and, if infection suspected, blood cultures).
- Imaging safe in pregnancy: renal/bladder ultrasound as the first-line test to look for hydronephrosis or a visible stone. Obstetric (fetal) assessment as well.
- If ultrasound is inconclusive but suspicion is high, MRI without contrast can be used in pregnancy; CT is highly accurate but generally avoided unless necessary and done with precautions after multidisciplinary discussion.

Immediate management considerations
- Pain control: acetaminophen is the preferred first-line analgesic in pregnancy. Avoid NSAIDs, especially in the third trimester.
- Antiemetic as needed (ondansetron is commonly used).
- If urinalysis or clinical picture suggests infection/pyelonephritis (fever, sepsis signs): IV antibiotics and hospitalization are indicated (ceftriaxone is a common choice). Obstructing stone with infection is an emergency and requires urgent drainage (ureteral stent or nephrostomy) plus antibiotics.
- If a nonobstructing stone and no infection: many stones pass spontaneously; conservative management and urology follow-up are appropriate. If pain is uncontrolled or the stone is large/obstructing, urology may perform ureteroscopy even during pregnancy.

When to return to the ED right away
- Fever, chills, or shaking rigors
- Worsening or unrelieved pain
- Decreased fetal movements, vaginal bleeding, or contractions
- Nausea/vomiting you cannot tolerate (dehydration)

Bottom line
Your presentation most likely represents a kidney/ureteral stone but needs urinalysis, renal ultrasound and blood tests to confirm and to exclude infection or obstruction. Pain control with acetaminophen and prompt urology/obstetric input if there is evidence of infection, obstruction, or worsening symptoms.

Following the accident, I lost consciousness and was brought to the emergency department by ambulance. My medical history is mostly unremarkable except for an allergy to amoxicillin, which caused a rash when I took it for an upper respiratory infection just a week prior. 

Upon my arrival at the hospital, I underwent resuscitation. The medical team performed a FAST exam, which revealed free fluid in Morrison’s pouch, indicating potential internal injury. My initial assessment showed only minor bruises and scrapes on my body. After further resuscitation efforts, I began to regain consciousness but subsequently started to vomit.",A. Duodenal hematoma B. Laceration of the liver C. Laceration of the spleen D. No signs of internal trauma E. Rupture of the inferior vena cava,C,Laceration of the spleen,neutral,"Sorry that happened — you’ve described a potentially serious picture. Key issues and usual next steps:

1. What the findings likely mean
- A positive FAST in Morrison’s pouch (hepatorenal recess) usually indicates free intraperitoneal fluid, commonly blood from a liver injury after blunt trauma. That raises concern for ongoing intra‑abdominal bleeding.
- Loss of consciousness with subsequent vomiting is also a red flag for traumatic brain injury (TBI) — vomiting can be a sign of increased intracranial pressure or concussion.

2. Immediate actions your team should (or likely will) take
- Airway/Breathing/Circulation: keep you NPO, protect airway (suction, consider intubation if decreased consciousness or repeated vomiting to prevent aspiration), give oxygen, IV access, fluids/blood as needed.
- Head CT (non‑contrast) urgently because of LOC + vomiting to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage.
- Abdominal CT with IV contrast if you are hemodynamically stable to define the source/extent of injury. If unstable with a positive FAST, emergency laparotomy may be required.
- Continuous monitoring: serial abdominal exams, repeat FAST or imaging, frequent vital signs, hemoglobin/hematocrit checks, urine output monitoring.
- Anti‑emetic (e.g., ondansetron) for vomiting if airway and consciousness are safe; pain control as appropriate.
- Cervical spine immobilization until cleared by imaging/clinical exam.

3. About your amoxicillin allergy
- A rash from amoxicillin a week ago should be documented and communicated to the team. That history matters for antibiotic choice but does not preclude iodinated contrast for CT scans.
- If the reaction was a simple rash (non‑anaphylactic), many clinicians will still give cephalosporins with caution; if there was a history of anaphylaxis, alternatives (e.g., clindamycin + aminoglycoside depending on indication) are used. The surgical/anesthesia teams will choose perioperative antibiotics based on the allergy details.

4. Red flags that need immediate escalation
- New or worsening low blood pressure, fast heart rate, faintness, worsening abdominal pain or abdominal rigidity, decreasing urine output, repeated vomiting with decreased consciousness, severe headache, unequal pupils, seizures, worsening confusion, or new weakness/numbness.

5. Practical steps for you now
- Make sure the ED/team know the amoxicillin reaction details (rash vs. anaphylaxis).
- Stay NPO and tell staff about ongoing vomiting.
- Ask whether a head CT and an abdominal CT (or urgent surgical evaluation) have been done/planned.
- Request documentation of blood type/crossmatch and whether blood products are available if bleeding is suspected.
- If you’re not already in monitored care, ask to be in a monitored area (trauma bay/ICU) given the findings.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance D. Multiple myeloma E. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,C,Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance,neutral,"I can help interpret those labs, but I don’t have the actual numbers yet. Could you paste the hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet count (with units) here? Also tell me whether you’re having any symptoms (fever, unusual fatigue, easy bruising/bleeding, recurrent infections), and what cancer medications you are taking now (tamoxifen, an aromatase inhibitor, chemo, none).

While you get that, here are the key points so you know what the results usually mean:

Typical reference ranges (adult women, approximate)
- Hemoglobin (Hgb): ~12–16 g/dL
- Hematocrit (Hct): ~36–46%
- White blood cell (WBC) count: ~4.5–11.0 ×10^3/µL
- Platelets: ~150–400 ×10^3/µL

What abnormal results commonly suggest
- Low hemoglobin/hematocrit (anemia): causes include iron deficiency (bleeding), chronic disease, B12/folate deficiency, recent blood loss (less likely with an isolated ankle fracture), or bone marrow suppression from chemo or marrow involvement. Significant anemia (Hgb <8 g/dL) can cause symptoms and often needs prompt evaluation.
- Low WBC (leukopenia), especially low neutrophils (neutropenia): increases infection risk. Severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500/µL) is urgent.
- High WBC: often infection or inflammation; can also occur with stress, steroids, or blood cancers.
- Low platelets (thrombocytopenia): increases bleeding/bruising risk. Platelets <50,000/µL raise bleeding concerns; <20,000/µL risks spontaneous bleeding and is urgent.
- High platelets (thrombocytosis): often reactive to inflammation, iron deficiency, or less commonly a myeloproliferative disorder.

Things in your history that matter
- Prior breast cancer and prior chemotherapy/radiation: these can cause lingering marrow suppression or, less commonly, marrow involvement from metastatic disease — both can lower blood counts.
- Current cancer therapy: tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors usually do not cause major cytopenias; active chemotherapy often does.
- Fluoxetine: rarely can lower platelets or impair platelet function (increased bleeding risk). Also important to check if you’re on tamoxifen — fluoxetine inhibits CYP2D6 and can reduce tamoxifen effectiveness.
- Bulimia: chronic purging can lead to nutritional deficiencies (iron, folate, B12) that cause anemia.
- Recent fracture/fall: unlikely to cause large blood-loss anemia from an isolated ankle fracture, but trauma and immobility raise concerns about infection or clot risk.

When to seek urgent care
- Fever, severe weakness, fast heart rate, shortness of breath (possible severe anemia or infection)
- New or worsening bleeding (nosebleeds, blood in stool/urine, large bruises)
- New mouth sores, persistent high fevers, or signs of serious infection (if neutropenic)

Next steps I’d expect the oncologist to take if results are abnormal
- Repeat the CBC to confirm
- Review medications and recent treatments
- Check differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes), iron studies, B12/folate, reticulocyte count, and possibly peripheral smear
- If pancytopenia or unexplained cytopenias: consider bone marrow evaluation or hematology referral

- A palpable, nontender, cystic right‑upper‑quadrant mass (Courvoisier sign) strongly suggests an extrinsic malignant obstruction of the common bile duct rather than gallstone disease.
- Age, weight loss, long smoking history are risk factors for pancreatic cancer.
- Ultrasound/sonogram showing an anechoic subhepatic cystic mass (distended gallbladder) with intra‑ and extrahepatic ductal dilation fits obstruction at or distal to the common bile duct.

Recommended next steps:
- Cross‑sectional imaging (contrast enhanced CT abdomen or MRCP) to localize a pancreatic/ampullary mass and assess resectability.
- ERCP (or EUS with fine‑needle aspiration) for tissue diagnosis and possible biliary stent placement to relieve obstruction if needed.
- Serum CA 19‑9 can support the diagnosis (not diagnostic alone).

I experienced crampy pain in my lower abdomen, which was somewhat relieved after I had a bowel movement. Additionally, I had several episodes of diarrhea.

Two weeks prior, I returned from a camping trip in the Rocky Mountains, where I consumed beef and chicken that were cooked over a fire pit. I was concerned that the undercooked meats I had eaten might be the cause of my current symptoms.

Upon arriving at the hospital, I was given intravenous fluids and morphine for pain relief. During my examination, my temperature was recorded at 99.5°F, and my vital signs were stable. While I felt uncomfortable, the physical examination revealed abdominal pain upon palpation. I also had multiple painful shallow ulcers in my mouth and a pruritic ring-like lesion on my lower extremities. 

The medical team decided to run laboratory tests to further investigate my condition. Overall, I was anxious about the situation, particularly given my recent camping trip and the potential link to my symptoms.",A. Bowel wall spasticity B. Gram-negative microaerophilic organism C. p-ANCA positive autoimmune bowel disease D. Rectal mucosa outpouching E. Transmural granulomas in the bowel,E,Transmural granulomas in the bowel,neutral,"Thanks — this is a helpful, detailed history. The combination of crampy lower‑abdominal pain with diarrhea, low‑grade fever, painful shallow oral ulcers, and a lower‑extremity skin lesion strongly raises inflammatory bowel disease (most likely Crohn disease) as the leading diagnosis — especially given your age and the pattern of symptoms. Crohn’s commonly causes crampy abdominal pain that may ease after a bowel movement, aphthous oral ulcers, and extraintestinal skin findings (erythema nodosum or other inflammatory rashes). That said, infectious gastroenteritis (especially Campylobacter from undercooked poultry, Yersinia, Salmonella, or Shigella) can produce similar GI symptoms and can sometimes trigger reactive skin/joint problems, so the doctors are right to check for infection first.

What the team will likely do next (and what I’d expect to be helpful)
- Stool testing first to rule out infection: stool culture (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia), C. difficile test if indicated, ova & parasites, stool leukocytes or lactoferrin, and fecal calprotectin (a sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation that helps distinguish IBD from simple infection).
- Blood tests: CBC (look for anemia, leukocytosis), CRP and/or ESR (inflammatory markers), CMP (electrolytes, liver enzymes), possibly blood cultures if febrile.
- Imaging: abdominal CT or MR enterography if acute severe pain or to evaluate bowel inflammation/complications.
- Endoscopy: colonoscopy with terminal ileum intubation and biopsies — this is the test that most often establishes Crohn disease (transmural inflammation, skip lesions, sometimes noncaseating granulomas).

Brief note about treatment and next steps
- While infection is being ruled out, supportive care (IV fluids, pain control, avoid NSAIDs) is appropriate. Empiric antibiotics are not routinely given unless a specific bacterial pathogen is identified or there are signs of systemic infection.
- If testing confirms Crohn disease, short‑term corticosteroids are typically used to induce remission for moderate–severe flares; longer‑term control uses steroid‑sparing drugs (azathioprine, methotrexate) and/or biologics (anti‑TNF, anti‑integrin, etc.) under GI supervision.
- If an infectious cause is found: management depends on the organism (e.g., macrolides for Campylobacter in severe disease; Yersinia/Salmonella treatment varies).
- For the mouth ulcers and skin lesions, symptomatic treatments (topical steroid mouthwash, topical care for the rash) and treating the underlying disease usually help.

Red flags that would require urgent intervention
- High fever, severe bloody diarrhea, progressive weakness, severe dehydration, signs of peritonitis — notify the team immediately.

43,"I am a 26-year-old man who recently visited the emergency department due to hemoptysis, which I had been experiencing for the past day. Alongside this symptom, I had also noticed increasing fatigue and unintentional weight loss of about 10 kg over the last two months. Occasionally, I experienced a dry cough. 

As a college student, I work part-time as a cashier in a bookstore. I am sexually active with my girlfriend and we sometimes use condoms for protection. I smoke 2 to 3 cigarettes on weekends but do not consume alcohol. 

During my visit, my pulse was measured at 97 beats per minute, my blood pressure was 128/76 mm Hg, and my temperature was 36.7°C. The physical examination showed that I was well-developed overall, but there was mild gynecomastia. My heart rate and rhythm were regular, and the examination of my lungs revealed clear sounds with some occasional crepitations. 

However, I had a notable tenderness in my right testicle, which was larger than the left and did not transilluminate. It remained unchanged in size after I performed a Valsalva maneuver. Following some laboratory tests, I learned that I had elevated levels of beta-HCG. This series of symptoms and findings is concerning, and I understand that a diagnosis is being considered.",A.

Key points that point to this:
- Young man with a firm, nontransilluminating, noncompressible testicular mass and testicular tenderness.
- Markedly elevated beta-hCG and clinical gynecomastia (hCG can cause endocrine effects).
- Systemic symptoms (weight loss, fatigue, dry cough) and hemoptysis — very suggestive of pulmonary metastases, which are common with choriocarcinoma and other nonseminomatous tumors.

What should happen next (urgent):
1. Scrotal ultrasound (high‑resolution) to confirm an intratesticular solid mass.
2. Additional serum tumor markers: alpha‑fetoprotein (AFP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). (AFP is not elevated in pure choriocarcinoma or seminoma; patterns help classify the tumor.)
3. Staging imaging: CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (or at least chest CT and abdominal/pelvic CT) to look for lung and retroperitoneal metastases; brain imaging if neurologic symptoms or very high hCG.
4. Urgent referral to Urology and Medical Oncology. Definitive diagnosis and initial treatment is usually by radical inguinal orchiectomy (do not biopsy the testis through the scrotum). If metastatic disease is present, systemic chemotherapy (e.g., BEP regimen — bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) is commonly used.
5. Discuss sperm cryopreservation before orchiectomy/chemotherapy because of fertility risk.

About a year ago, I experienced a minor injury that resulted in a broken distal radius. In terms of growth, I am at the 95th percentile for height and the 50th percentile for weight. During my physical examination, the doctor noted that I have nodulocystic acne on my face, chest, and upper back. My breast development is classified as Tanner stage I. 

A pelvic examination revealed that I have normal pubic hair, but there was clitoromegaly present. To further assess my condition, I underwent a pelvic ultrasound, which showed that my ovaries contain multiple cysts and that my uterus appears normal. This collection of symptoms led to discussions regarding my diagnosis.",A. Aromatase deficiency B. Turner syndrome C. Kallmann syndrome D. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia E. Mullerian agenesis F. Polycystic ovary syndrome,A,Aromatase deficiency,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: aromatase deficiency (CYP19A1 mutation).

Why this fits
- Maternal virilization during pregnancy indicates excess fetal/placental androgens reaching the mother — classically seen with fetal placental aromatase deficiency.
- 46,XX with ambiguous genitalia at birth and clitoromegaly (external virilization) but a normal uterus and ovaries fits aromatase deficiency (internal female structures preserved).
- Lack of breast development (Tanner I) despite normal pubic hair and marked acne indicates estrogen deficiency with excess androgens (pubic hair develops from androgens).
- Tall stature and a fragility fracture reflect lack of estrogen → delayed epiphyseal closure and low bone mineral density.
- Ovarian cysts are typical from chronic gonadotropin stimulation in the absence of estrogen feedback.

Tests to confirm
- Karyotype (expect 46,XX).
- Serum hormones: low estradiol, elevated androgens (testosterone, androstenedione), and usually elevated FSH/LH (hypergonadotropic).
- Urinary steroid profile and/or genetic testing for CYP19A1 mutations to confirm aromatase deficiency.
- Bone density (DEXA).

Key management points
- Start estrogen replacement (pubertal induction with gradually escalating estradiol), later add cyclic progestin to establish menses and protect the endometrium.
- Treat low bone density with estrogen and consider calcium/vitamin D; monitor DEXA.
- Discuss options for genital surgery (if desired) and psychosocial support.
- Genetic counseling for the family and confirmatory molecular testing.

45,"I am a 66-year-old woman who recently visited the emergency department due to palpitations. For the past six months, I had been experiencing episodes of palpitations and lightheadedness, which typically resolved on their own. However, this morning, the symptoms persisted. My medical history includes a transient ischemic attack two months ago, along with hypertension and diabetes. I take aspirin, metformin, and lisinopril for these conditions. 

I was informed that my grandfather had passed away from a stroke, and my mother has a blood disorder. During my visit, an electrocardiogram was performed, revealing an irregularly irregular rhythm with a rapid ventricular response, indicating atrial fibrillation. I was treated with intravenous metoprolol, which alleviated my symptoms. 

In addition to starting a beta-blocker for long-term management, I was also determined to need anticoagulation therapy. Consequently, I began receiving both unfractionated heparin and warfarin. 

Five days later, I started experiencing pain and swelling in my left lower leg. A Doppler ultrasound was conducted, which showed thrombosis in my right popliteal and tibial veins. Additionally, a complete blood count indicated a decrease in my platelet count from 245,000/mm^3 to 90,000/mm^3. My coagulation studies were also assessed during this time.",A. Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura B. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura C. Type I heparin-induced thrombocytopenia D. Type II heparin-induced thrombocytopenia E. Warfarin toxicity,D,Type II heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with new venous thrombosis.

Why this fits
- Platelets fell from 245,000 to 90,000 (~60% drop) within about 5 days of heparin exposure — typical timing for immune (type II) HIT.
- New thrombosis while receiving heparin is classic for HIT (HIT is pro‑thrombotic despite thrombocytopenia).

Immediate management you should expect (urgent)
1. Stop all heparin immediately (including heparin flushes, heparin-coated lines).  
2. Stop warfarin now and give vitamin K if warfarin was therapeutic or started recently — continuing warfarin in acute HIT can cause severe microthrombosis/venous limb gangrene because of rapid protein C decline.  
3. Start a non‑heparin parenteral anticoagulant right away (do not give low‑molecular‑weight heparin). Typical choices: argatroban or bivalirudin (direct thrombin inhibitors) or fondaparinux (indirect Xa inhibitor; often used off‑label). Your treating team will choose depending on kidney/liver function and local availability.  
4. Do NOT transfuse platelets unless there is life‑threatening bleeding or an urgent invasive procedure.

Confirmatory testing and next steps
- Get an anti–PF4/heparin antibody ELISA (high sensitivity) now. If positive, a functional assay (serotonin release assay) can confirm.  
- Calculate a 4Ts score (thrombocytopenia magnitude, timing, thrombosis, other causes) — your history would usually give a high pretest probability.  
- If HIT is confirmed (or highly likely) and you have a thrombosis, continue the non‑heparin anticoagulant for at least 3 months. If no thrombosis, use it for at least 4 weeks.  
- Only transition to warfarin after platelet count has recovered (typically >150,000/mm^3). When you do transition, overlap the non‑heparin anticoagulant with warfarin for at least 5 days and until INR is therapeutic for 24–48 hours.

Other important points
- Document “heparin allergy / HIT” in your chart and alert future providers — avoid all heparins.  
- Platelet transfusion is generally avoided unless bleeding.  
- Expect input from hematology and vascular medicine for anticoagulation choice and duration; you may need imaging/management of the DVT.

I have been managing type 2 diabetes for 29 years, using metformin as my medication. During my visit, the medical staff checked my vital signs, which indicated a blood pressure of 111/72 mm Hg, a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), and a pulse rate of 100 beats per minute. They also performed a fingerstick test that showed my blood glucose level was 210 mg/dL.

Brief psychotic disorder D. Delirium E. Delusional disorder,D,Delirium,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: acute delirium (an acute confusional state) — most likely secondary to an infection, classically a urinary tract infection in an older person.

Why: delirium is characterized by an acute (hours–days) change in attention and awareness with fluctuating confusion — exactly what you describe. You also have fever (38.5°C) and a fast pulse, pointing to infection as the precipitant. In elderly people UTI or pneumonia commonly present mainly with new confusion rather than typical urinary or respiratory symptoms. Your blood glucose (210 mg/dL) is elevated but not high enough for a hyperosmolar state, and hypoglycemia doesn’t fit. Stroke or other neurologic causes are possible if focal signs are present, but the overall picture favors infection‑triggered delirium.

Usual next steps the team should do:
- Urinalysis and urine culture (to check for UTI)
- Chest x‑ray and clinical exam (to look for pneumonia)
- Blood tests: CBC, electrolytes, renal function, glucose, blood cultures if sepsis suspected
- Medication review and assessment for other causes (dehydration, pain, hypoxia)
- Consider head CT if there are focal neurologic signs, new severe headache, or concern for stroke/bleed

Treatment principles:
- Treat the underlying infection if found (antibiotics)
- Supportive care: rehydration, correction of electrolytes, orientation measures, sleep hygiene, fall precautions
- Avoid sedating medications if possible; use low‑dose antipsychotic only if severe agitation threatens safety
- Monitor closely and reassess, since delirium is often reversible once the cause is treated

Dislodged occlusive thrombus D. Stress induced cardiomyopathy E. Vasospastic vessel disease,B,Coronary steal,neutral,"Most likely explanation: dipyridamole caused coronary “steal” and provoked ischemia from underlying coronary artery disease.

Why: dipyridamole (a pharmacologic coronary vasodilator used in stress testing) dilates small coronary arterioles in well‑perfused myocardium. In the presence of a fixed narrowing (atherosclerotic stenosis), that can shunt blood away from the ischemic territory and worsen myocardial ischemia and pain. Your diabetes and hypertension put you at high risk for significant coronary disease. An initially normal ECG and a low/normal troponin do not rule out evolving ischemia or an NSTEMI — troponins can rise later.

What should be done now (tell the team / expect these steps)
- Stop/hold any further dipyridamole.  
- Immediate ECG and continuous monitoring.  
- Give nitrates for pain as long as blood pressure allows.  
- Give IV aminophylline (or theophylline) to reverse dipyridamole/adenosine effects if the symptoms are thought to be drug‑related.  
- Serial troponins (e.g., 3–6 hours) and repeat ECGs.  
- Cardiology consult urgently; if ongoing ischemia, ECG changes, or rising troponins, you may need urgent coronary angiography (catheterization).  
- Continue standard acute ischemia care (oxygen if hypoxic, antiplatelet therapy as indicated, beta‑blocker if not contraindicated) per cardiology/ED.

""",A,Diaphragmatic rupture,neutral,"Thanks — this is a helpful history. Based on what you’ve described, here’s what is most likely and what to expect next.

Most likely explanations for your chest pain and shortness of breath after a high‑speed blunt chest impact
- The two highest priorities are a pneumothorax (air in the chest outside the lung) or a hemothorax (blood in the chest). Both commonly cause decreased breath sounds on one side, chest pain and shortness of breath after trauma.
- Pulmonary contusion (bruising of the lung) and rib fractures with associated pain/atelectasis are also common and can cause similar symptoms.
- Less likely but important to consider after high‑energy trauma: major vascular injury (for example to the aorta), especially if there was severe chest compression.

What the chest x‑ray will look for and what it can show
- Pneumothorax: a clear line with absent lung markings beyond it; lung collapse. Small pneumothoraces can be missed on supine films.
- Hemothorax: blunting or layering of the costophrenic angle or an area of opacity on the affected side.
- Rib fractures, lung contusion (patchy infiltrates), or mediastinal widening (suggestive of major vascular injury).
- If the x‑ray is equivocal but concern remains, a CT chest is much more sensitive and is commonly done in trauma.

Immediate next steps and common treatments
- Supplemental oxygen and close monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and blood pressure.
- If a significant pneumothorax or hemothorax is confirmed or you become more short of breath or unstable, a chest tube (thoracostomy) is usually placed.
- Pain control and respiratory physiotherapy (incentive spirometry) for rib fractures or contusion.
- Because you have left upper‑quadrant abdominal tenderness, the team should also evaluate for splenic injury (FAST ultrasound and/or CT abdomen) — abdominal bleeding can be hidden and serious.
- Wound care for the chest laceration and tetanus update if needed.

Other assessments likely being done
- Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (e-FAST) to rapidly check for free fluid in the chest/abdomen and for pneumothorax.
- Trauma CT (chest/abdomen/pelvis) if indicated by mechanism, exam or x‑ray results.
- Routine trauma labs (CBC, blood type/screen, coagulation tests) and continuous monitoring.

When to be worried
- Worsening shortness of breath, increasing chest pain, lightheadedness, fainting, rapid drop in blood pressure, or oxygen saturation falling — these require immediate reassessment and possibly emergency intervention.

Practical advice
- Ask the team for the chest x‑ray results and whether they plan an e‑FAST or CT. If your pain or breathing worsens, tell staff immediately.
- Keep deep breathing and coughing as comfortably possible (with pain control), so you don’t develop atelectasis.

Panic disorder E. Post-traumatic stress disorder,E,Post-traumatic stress disorder,neutral,"First, I’m sorry you went through that — what you’re describing is a common and understandable reaction after a traumatic event.

What this likely is
- Your symptoms (persistent anxiety, avoidance/withdrawal, intrusive panic reactions when reminded of crashes, guilt, mood change) beginning after a traumatic event and lasting about a month are most consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A mental health professional can confirm this and check for depression, acute stress disorder, or other conditions.

What to do next (short-term)
- If you have any thoughts of harming yourself or others, call emergency services now or your local crisis line (in the U.S. call 988). If you’re not in the U.S., use your country’s emergency/crisis number.
- Make an appointment with your primary care provider or a mental health clinician (psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed therapist experienced in trauma). They can assess severity, safety, and next steps.

Evidence-based treatments
- Trauma-focused psychotherapy is first-line and often very effective:
  - Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)
  - Prolonged Exposure (PE)
  - Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
- Medications can help, particularly SSRIs (e.g., sertraline, paroxetine) or SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine) if depression or severe anxiety are present. A psychiatrist or your PCP can discuss pros/cons.
- Benzodiazepines are generally not recommended for PTSD long-term.

Practical coping strategies you can start now
- Grounding for panic: 5-4-3-2-1 (name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste) or slow diaphragmatic breathing (inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 6–8s).
- Short, regular relaxation practice: progressive muscle relaxation or guided mindfulness 10–20 minutes/day.
- Manage driving triggers with graded exposure: start sitting in a car, then short quiet drives, gradually increasing distance/time; practice breathing and a support person initially.
- Challenge guilt with cognitive techniques: examine evidence, what was or wasn’t under your control, and what you did or could reasonably be expected to do.
- Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs (they worsen recovery).
- Stay connected to supportive friends/family; consider a support group for trauma survivors.

How I can help next
- If you like, I can:
  - Help you draft what to say to a clinician or to your employer.
  - Walk you through a simple graded-exposure plan for driving.
  - Find trauma therapists or resources in your area (tell me your city or region).

Polyarteritis nodosa,E,Cholesterol embolization,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: cholesterol (athero-)embolism to the kidneys and skin caused by dislodged aortic plaque during the recent cardiac catheterization.

Why: the classic pattern is new renal failure 1–2 weeks after an arterial procedure, livedo reticularis/“blue toe” or mottled purplish discoloration, systemic inflammation (fever, leukocytosis, high ESR), and renal biopsy that shows needle‑ or spindle‑shaped intravascular clefts (cholesterol crystals that are dissolved out during processing) with an associated inflammatory/giant‑cell reaction.

Other causes considered but less likely: contrast nephropathy (occurs within 48–72 hours and lacks cholesterol clefts), septic emboli or vasculitis (different biopsy and clinical features), NSAID nephropathy (doesn’t cause livedo or cholesterol clefts).

Typical management and next steps:
- Supportive care: optimize blood pressure, manage fluid/electrolyte balance, renal replacement therapy if needed.
- Start/continue high‑intensity statin therapy (stabilizes plaques and is associated with improved outcomes).
- Avoid further invasive arterial manipulation if possible.
- Discuss the risks/benefits of anticoagulation with cardiology (anticoagulation can worsen cholesterol embolization but stopping antiplatelet therapy after stenting has its own risks).
- Corticosteroids are sometimes used for severe, progressive disease but evidence is limited—consider on a case‑by‑case basis with nephrology.
- Wound care/vascular surgery for skin complications as needed.

Although isotretinoin can be associated with depression/suicidality, the temporal link to job loss and the clinical picture favor an adjustment reaction.

Recommended approach: brief supportive psychotherapy/CBT and close follow-up. Monitor mood and suicidality (and reassess the need to continue isotretinoin with her dermatologist if symptoms worsen). If symptoms persist beyond a few months or meet criteria for major depression, consider antidepressant therapy.",Normal stress reaction,False,True,False,False,True
53,"I am a 55-year-old man with a medical history that includes diabetes and hypertension. I arrived at the emergency department due to experiencing chest pain that began yesterday. The pain seemed to worsen with exertion, which prompted my visit. At the time of my arrival, I was not feeling any pain, but I wanted to ensure that everything was alright. While I was in triage, the medical staff performed an ECG to assess my condition. I am now awaiting further evaluation and a diagnosis based on my symptoms and the ECG results.",A. Bundle branch block B. Coronary artery occlusion C. Hypercalcemia D. Hyperkalemia E. Normal physiologic variant,B,Coronary artery occlusion,neutral,"Thanks — that history (chest pain with exertion yesterday, age 55, diabetes and hypertension) increases your risk for a cardiac cause. I can’t make a diagnosis without the ECG tracings and blood tests, but here’s what to expect and what the ED team is likely doing, plus what findings would mean.

What the ED will/should do now
- Serial ECGs (on arrival and repeated if symptoms change). If you can, ask for a copy or a verbal readout of any abnormalities.
- Blood tests including cardiac troponin at presentation and again 3–6 hours later (sometimes sooner with high‑sensitivity assays).
- Basic labs (BMP, glucose, CBC) and vitals/oxygen monitoring.
- Chest X‑ray if indicated and continuous cardiac monitoring if there’s concern.
- Risk stratification (HEART or TIMI score) to decide observation vs admission vs urgent catheterization.
- If high risk or ST‑elevation/new left bundle branch block or ongoing ischemia → emergent cardiology/cath lab.
- If lower risk but possible ischemia → observation, serial troponins and often a stress test or coronary CT / angiography as outpatient/inpatient decision.

What common ECG findings would suggest
- ST‑elevation in contiguous leads → ST‑elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) → urgent reperfusion (PCI).
- ST‑depression or deep T‑wave inversions → ischemia or non‑ST‑elevation MI (NSTEMI) or unstable angina.
- New left bundle branch block, new Q waves, or dynamic changes over serial ECGs → concerning for acute MI.
- Diffuse ST elevation with PR depression → pericarditis (different treatment).
- Normal ECG does not rule out cardiac ischemia—troponins and serial testing matter.

Immediate actions you can take/ask about
- If you haven’t already received aspirin and you’re not allergic / don’t have a bleeding problem, ask the team about chewable aspirin (162–325 mg); this is commonly given early for suspected ACS.
- Ask the team for results of ECG, troponin plan (timing and expected reporting), and your risk score (HEART/TIMI) and their disposition plan.
- Return to the ED immediately if chest pain recurs or you develop shortness of breath, syncope, faintness, sweating, or new weakness.

Other possibilities (besides coronary ischemia)
- Musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pericarditis — the ED will consider these based on exam, imaging, and tests.

During this time, I had not eaten anything, and my parents were unable to calm me down. They mentioned that I had not experienced any trauma leading up to this. I was born at term through an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. 

When I arrived at the emergency department, the medical staff took my vital signs, which were within normal limits. Upon examination, they noticed that the second toe on my left foot was reddened and swollen. My parents were concerned and wanted to understand what might be causing my distress.",A. Raynaud phenomenon B. Ingrown toe nail C. Sickle cell dactylitis D. Insect bite E. Acute paronychia F. Hair tourniquet syndrome G. Cellulitis H. Herpetic whitlow I. Amniotic band syndrome J. Child abuse,F,Hair tourniquet syndrome,neutral,"Most likely this is a hair‑tourniquet (or thread‑tourniquet) of the toe. Reasoning: a previously well infant with sudden, persistent inconsolable crying and refusal to feed + a single red, swollen toe is classic for a hair or thread wrapped tightly around the base of the toe, causing pain, swelling and reduced circulation.

What to do now
- Ask the ED team to look carefully (use magnification) for a fine hair or fiber encircling the toe — it can be almost invisible and often sits in a groove at the base of the toe.
- If a hair/fiber is visible and not deeply embedded, it should be removed immediately (fine forceps, scissors or blunt probe to lift and cut/unwind). Warm water soaks and oil can help expose and loosen the hair.
- If the hair is not visible or is deeply embedded, urgent surgical release is needed (local anesthetic and a small longitudinal skin incision to free the constricting material). Ask for pediatric surgery/plastics if ED cannot safely release it.
- After release, reassess circulation (color, capillary refill, swelling) and watch for infection. Tetanus/prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely required unless there is contamination or established infection.

Red flags — need immediate urgent care/surgery
- Persistent pallor/cyanosis, absent capillary refill, increasing swelling, necrosis, or failure to improve after attempted removal.

Prevention and follow up
- Postpartum hair shedding is a common source; check socks, mittens and bedding. Inspect all toes, fingers and external genitalia if an infant is very irritable.
- Follow up with your pediatrician after release to ensure healing and to check for any tissue injury or infection.

If you are still in the ED, ask the staff specifically to look for and remove a hair tourniquet now; this is often curative and urgent.",Child abuse,True,False,True,True,True
55,"I am a 67-year-old man who recently went to the emergency department because I was experiencing anxiety and trouble swallowing. Over the past year, I noticed that my symptoms have gradually worsened, and I now find it difficult to swallow liquids. Not long ago, I recovered from the flu, but I have also experienced recent weight loss. 

I have a long history of smoking, totaling about 33 pack-years, and I am a former alcoholic. During the physical examination, my poor dental hygiene and foul breath were noted, which may be contributing to my discomfort. Overall, I have been feeling increasingly concerned about my condition as these issues have persisted.",A. Achalasia B. Globus hystericus C. Squamous cell carcinoma D. Viral-induced gastroparesis E. Zenker diverticulum,C,Squamous cell carcinoma,neutral,"I'm sorry you're dealing with this — your story has several ""red flag"" features that need prompt evaluation.

Most likely diagnosis
- Esophageal cancer (most commonly squamous cell in people with long smoking/alcohol histories) is the leading concern here. The typical pattern is progressive dysphagia that starts with solids and later includes liquids, plus weight loss and age >55.

Other possibilities
- Peptic (benign) stricture from long‑standing reflux
- Motility disorder (e.g., achalasia) — usually causes solids and liquids from the start
- Oropharyngeal dysphagia (e.g., Zenker diverticulum, structural lesions, or neuromuscular causes) — poor dentition/halitosis can contribute to throat symptoms but would less commonly explain progressive liquid intolerance
- Infection or inflammatory conditions (less likely given weight loss and gradual progression)

What you should do now
- This is an urgent situation. If you cannot swallow saliva, are drooling, have breathing difficulties, or feel you might aspirate, go to the emergency department immediately.
- If symptoms are less acute but persistent, arrange urgent evaluation by a gastroenterologist. People with progressive dysphagia, weight loss, or age >55 generally require investigation within days to a couple of weeks.

Key tests and evaluations you should expect
1. Upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD) with biopsy — the single most important test to diagnose or exclude cancer.  
2. If endoscopy is delayed or if oropharyngeal dysphagia is suspected, a barium swallow study may be used initially.  
3. If cancer is found, staging imaging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and often PET-CT) is next.  
4. Basic labs (CBC to check for anemia, metabolic panel, nutrition status) and nutritional assessment.  
5. ENT or speech/swallow evaluation if swallowing mechanics/oropharynx are suspected to be the problem.

Supportive measures
- Avoid solid foods if they get stuck; take small sips of liquid if safe. If liquids are now hard to swallow, seek urgent care.  
- Stop smoking and limit alcohol.  
- Improve dental hygiene and see a dentist — this won’t rule out cancer but can improve symptoms and reduce aspiration risk.

If you want, tell me:
- Did the swallowing problem start with solids and then progress to liquids?  
- Do you have any coughing with swallowing, hoarseness, chest pain, or regurgitation?  
- Any recent evaluations (endoscopy, barium study, chest imaging, labs)?

She mentioned that I have been dealing with a persistent dry cough for the past six months. Alongside the cough, I have noticed increasing fatigue and a weight loss of about 4.5 kg (10 lbs). Until this incident, I had no history of serious illness and I do not take any medications. I have been a smoker for the past 35 years, consuming one pack of cigarettes daily.

When I arrived at the emergency department, I was confused and could only recognize myself. Medical staff conducted various tests, and I learned that my serum sodium concentration was significantly low. Additionally, I was informed that a chest X-ray revealed an irregular, poorly defined density at my right hilum. The medical team expressed that a microscopic examination of this density would likely be necessary to determine the underlying diagnosis.",A. Squamous cell lung carcinoma B. Small cell lung carcinoma C. Large cell lung carcinoma D. Bronchial carcinoid tumor E. Lung adenocarcinoma,B,Small cell lung carcinoma,neutral,"Most likely explanation
- Your presentation (35–pack-year smoker, months of cough/weight loss, a central/hilar chest mass, and severe hyponatremia causing a tonic‑clonic seizure) is highly suspicious for small‑cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) with paraneoplastic SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion).
- Rationale: SCLC is common in long‑time smokers, often presents as a centrally located/hilar mass, and frequently produces ectopic ADH → concentrated urine, low serum sodium → neurologic symptoms/seizures.

Immediate management (what should be/was done in the ED)
1. Treat the life‑threatening hyponatremia first:
   - Symptomatic severe hyponatremia with seizure warrants careful hypertonic saline (3%) bolus (typically small boluses to raise sodium by a few mmol/L rapidly to stop cerebral edema/seizures). This must be done in monitored setting with frequent sodium checks.
   - Avoid overly rapid correction (generally aim to increase serum Na by no more than ~8 mmol/L in 24 hours) to prevent osmotic demyelination.
2. Get urgent labs to confirm SIADH and exclude other causes:
   - Serum osmolality, urine osmolality, urine sodium.
   - TSH and morning cortisol (to exclude hypothyroidism/adrenal insufficiency).
3. Short‑term measures after stabilization:
   - Fluid restriction is the first‑line measure for chronic SIADH once the acute emergency is treated.
   - If hyponatremia is persistent or severe: salt tablets, hypertonic saline with close monitoring, or pharmacologic options (demeclocycline or vasopressin V2 antagonists like tolvaptan) under specialist guidance.

Diagnostic steps to establish the lung diagnosis
- Chest CT with contrast (to better define the hilar lesion and look for mediastinal nodes).
- Tissue diagnosis is required (as your team said):
  - Bronchoscopy with biopsy for central lesions, or CT‑guided percutaneous biopsy if lesion is peripheral.
  - Sputum cytology or endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for nodal sampling may be options.
- Staging once tissue is obtained: CT abdomen/pelvis, PET/CT, and brain MRI (SCLC frequently metastasizes to brain).

Treatment and prognosis (brief)
- If confirmed SCLC:
  - It is aggressive but chemo‑ and radiosensitive. Treatment depends on stage: chemoradiation for limited stage; chemotherapy ± immunotherapy and palliative radiation for extensive disease.
  - Prognosis varies by stage; early detection improves outcomes but SCLC often presents at an advanced stage.
- Smoking cessation is important for overall health and treatment outcomes.

Other practical points
- Because the seizure was provoked by acute hyponatremia, long‑term antiepileptic drugs are not always required once sodium is corrected; this is decided by neurology based on recurrence risk.
- You should be followed by pulmonology and oncology urgently after stabilization.

If you want, I can summarize what questions to ask the team now (e.g., what your current sodium is, what treatments were given, whether they obtained urine studies, and planned biopsy/timing) and suggest what to expect next.",Lung adenocarcinoma,True,True,True,True,True
57,"I am a 32-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department after falling 7 feet onto a flat-top wooden post. Upon arrival, I was experiencing severe pain and was breathing rapidly. Medical staff noted my pulse was elevated at 135 beats per minute, and my respirations were at 30 per minute. I also had low blood pressure measured at 80/40 mm Hg.

The examination revealed an impact wound located in the left fourth intercostal space, specifically at the midaxillary line. During auscultation, the medical team observed that my trachea was deviating to the right, and there were absent breath sounds over my left lung. They also noted dullness to percussion over the left side of my chest, while my neck veins appeared flat. A cardiac examination showed no abnormalities.

To address my condition, the medical staff placed two large-bore intravenous catheters and began intravenous fluid resuscitation. The situation was critical, and I was closely monitored for further developments.",A. Cardiac tamponade B. Bronchial rupture C. Tension pneumothorax D. Flail chest E. Hemothorax,E,Hemothorax,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: massive left-sided hemothorax from the chest impact causing hypovolemic shock with mediastinal shift.

Why: absent breath sounds + dullness to percussion on the left = fluid (blood) in the pleural space. Tracheal deviation away from the left can occur from a large-volume hemothorax (or tension pneumothorax), but the presence of flat neck veins (not distended) and hypotension favors hemorrhagic shock from hemothorax rather than tension pneumothorax.

Immediate management (priorities)
- Emergent large-bore tube thoracostomy (chest tube, e.g., 36–40 Fr) into the left pleural space to evacuate blood and allow lung re-expansion.
- Continue aggressive resuscitation: blood transfusion (activate massive transfusion protocol if indicated), type O negative if crossmatch delayed; maintain large-bore IV access.
- Call thoracic/cardiothoracic surgery immediately. Prepare for emergent thoracotomy if any of the following occur: >1,500 mL immediate chest-tube output, persistent bleeding >200 mL/hr, or ongoing hemodynamic instability despite resuscitation.
- Do not do needle decompression (that is for tension pneumothorax with hyperresonance and JVD); don’t delay chest tube/definitive care for CT imaging if patient is unstable.
- Airway control/intubation if respiratory failure is imminent, but coordinate with surgical plans and resuscitation.

During the physical examination, I was drowsy and disoriented. The healthcare providers noted that my capillary refill was delayed and my mucous membranes appeared dry, while the rest of the examination did not provide further diagnostic information. 

Given these symptoms and my medical background, the medical team decided to initiate fluid resuscitation.",A. SIADH B. Psychogenic polydipsia C. Diabetes Mellitus D. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus E. Central diabetes insipidus,D,Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) → chronic polyuria/polydipsia with progressive free-water loss causing dehydration and hypernatremic encephalopathy (explains her drowsiness/confusion and dry mucous membranes).

Key immediate actions in the ED
1. Rapid bedside tests now: serum glucose, basic metabolic panel (Na, K, creatinine, BUN), serum osmolality, lithium level, venous/arterial blood gas if needed, and urine specific gravity/urine osmolality.
2. Hemodynamic stabilization:
   - If intravascularly depleted (signs of hypovolemia): start isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) to restore perfusion first.
   - After intravascular volume is restored, switch to hypotonic fluids to correct free-water deficit (e.g., D5W or 0.45% NaCl), because the principal problem is free-water loss.
3. Rate of sodium correction: correct hypernatremia slowly to avoid cerebral edema — aim to lower serum Na by no more than ~10–12 mEq/L in 24 hours (often targeted ~0.5 mEq/L/hr).
4. Monitor: frequent neurologic checks and serial serum sodium (q2–4 h initially), urine output, and electrolytes.

Specific treatment for lithium-associated NDI
- Stop or hold lithium while evaluating (check lithium level and coordinate with psychiatry/psychiatrist for alternative mood-stabilizing therapy).
- Medical therapy to reduce urine output:
  - Amiloride is preferred for lithium-induced NDI (blocks ENaC and reduces lithium entry into collecting duct cells).
  - Thiazide diuretics (e.g., HCTZ) and NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin) can reduce polyuria but use carefully and usually after initial resuscitation/consultation.
- Desmopressin (DDAVP) is used diagnostically to distinguish central DI (responds) from nephrogenic DI (no/few response); it is not usually effective as definitive therapy in NDI.

Other considerations
- Rule out hyperglycemia/ osmotic diuresis (check glucose and urine glucose).
- Evaluate renal function; chronic lithium use can cause chronic kidney disease.
- Involve nephrology and psychiatry for longer-term management decisions.

Bottom line: this presentation is most consistent with lithium-induced nephrogenic DI causing dehydration and hypernatremic encephalopathy. Immediate priorities are fluid resuscitation (restore volume, then give free water slowly), check sodium/lithium/renal function, hold lithium, and institute targeted therapy (amiloride ± thiazide/NSAID) with specialist input.",Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,False,True,False,True,True
59,"I am a 70-year-old man with a history of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Two hours ago, I began experiencing resting dyspnea while watching my granddaughter play soccer. Despite using albuterol and ipratropium, my breathing did not improve. I was given magnesium, methylprednisolone, and high-flow nasal cannula, but my condition did not stabilize. Eventually, I agreed to elective intubation and was transferred to the intensive care unit.

During my hospital stay, I developed pneumonia, which was treated with vancomycin, pipercillin-tazobactam, and gentamicin. I received nasogastric tube feeds and lactated Ringer's fluid boluses, along with subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prevention. On the seventh day of my hospitalization, I found it difficult to wean off the ventilator due to labored breathing.

While a nurse was changing the dressing on my sacral pressure ulcer, I experienced a sharp increase in peak airway pressure. I noticed I was wincing at that moment. My temperature was recorded at 100.1°F, blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg, and my pulse was 100 beats per minute. I was breathing 22 times per minute on the ventilator, despite a set respiratory rate of 14. My condition was closely monitored, but I remained in a challenging state.",A. Acalculous cholecystitis B. Acute cholangitis C. Biliary colic D. Calculous cholecystitis E. Critical illness pancreatitis,A,Acalculous cholecystitis,neutral,"What happened
- A sudden rise in peak airway pressure on a ventilated patient means either airway resistance suddenly went up (bronchospasm, coughing, secretions, kinked/occluded endotracheal tube) or respiratory system compliance suddenly dropped (pneumothorax, severe atelectasis, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, abdominal distension).  
- The fact you were wincing during a painful dressing change and the ventilator-recorded rate rose from a set 14 to 22 suggests you were triggering extra breaths (patient–ventilator asynchrony) and likely coughing or having increased respiratory drive. That favors increased airway resistance (bronchospasm or secretion/ETT obstruction) or agitation/pain causing you to “fight” the ventilator. Pneumothorax is less likely from this history but must be ruled out because it can also present with sudden high peak pressures.

What the ICU team should do immediately (prioritized)
1. Rapid bedside assessment: check SpO2, HR, BP, look for obvious distress, inspect chest rise and symmetry, listen for unilateral diminished breath sounds, and look for subcutaneous emphysema.  
2. Check ventilator waveforms and measure plateau pressure (inspiratory hold):  
   - If plateau pressure is normal but peak is high → airway resistance problem (bronchospasm, secretions, kinking, ETT obstruction).  
   - If plateau and peak pressures are both high → decreased compliance (pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, large atelectasis).  
3. Suction the endotracheal tube for secretions. Inspect tubing for kinks or occlusion.  
4. Treat likely reversible causes: give nebulized bronchodilator (albuterol) via the ETT and consider additional short-acting opioid or sedative for pain/agonizing efforts to correct asynchrony. If severe and uncontrolled, consider temporary neuromuscular blockade.  
5. If any signs suggest pneumothorax (sudden hypotension, marked unilateral breath‑sound reduction, hyperresonance, subQ emphysema) — do not wait for CXR: perform immediate decompression (needle, then chest tube) and/or bedside ultrasound to confirm.  
6. Obtain ABG, portable chest x‑ray (or ultrasound) and continue close hemodynamic monitoring.

Most likely in your case
- Given the timing (during a painful dressing change), wincing, and the ventilator rate rising, the most likely immediate cause is patient–ventilator asynchrony with coughing/bronchospasm or ETT secretion/partial obstruction increasing airway resistance. Pneumothorax is less likely but must be excluded quickly.

60,"I am a 33-year-old woman, and I was brought to the emergency department after experiencing sudden chest pain. This incident occurred while I was visiting my husband on the oncology floor. I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my chest and became short of breath.

Additionally, an initial set of cardiac troponins indicated a value of 0.8 ng/mL, and I had an elevated D-dimer. I was anxious about the situation, but I was aware that the healthcare providers were working diligently to determine the cause of my symptoms.",A. Anxiety B. Myocardial infarction C. Prinzmetal angina D. Pulmonary embolism E. Stress cardiomyopathy,E,Stress cardiomyopathy,neutral,"Thank you — that’s a helpful summary. I’ll give the most likely causes of your presentation, what the abnormal tests mean, and the usual next steps the team will likely take. If you want, tell me the ECG and chest x‑ray results and any risk factors (birth control/pregnancy, recent travel/surgery, personal/family blood clots, smoking) and I can be more specific.

What your findings suggest
- Tachycardia (pulse 129) with sudden pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath raises strong concern for pulmonary embolism (PE). An elevated D‑dimer supports that concern (it’s sensitive but not specific).
- A troponin of 0.8 ng/mL is above the usual normal range and indicates myocardial injury. That can be caused by a heart attack (acute coronary syndrome) but can also be seen with significant PE (right‑heart strain), myocarditis, or stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo).
- Normal oxygen saturation does not rule out PE; many patients with PE have normal O2 sat initially.
- ECG and chest x‑ray are useful to look for alternative causes (pneumothorax, pneumonia, ischemic changes, RV strain on ECG) — I need those results to refine the impression.

Most likely diagnoses (in order)
1. Pulmonary embolism with secondary RV strain (fits sudden pleuritic pain, tachycardia, elevated D‑dimer ± troponin).  
2. Acute coronary syndrome (less likely at age 33 but possible—troponin elevation and chest pain).  
3. Stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy or myocarditis.  
4. Less likely: spontaneous pneumothorax (would usually show on CXR), severe asthma exacerbation, aortic dissection (rare at your age without risk factors).

Typical next steps in the ED
1. Get the ECG and chest x‑ray results (if you can share them).  
2. Evaluate PE pretest probability (Wells or Geneva score). If imaging is indicated:
   - CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the usual diagnostic test if kidney function allows.
   - If CTPA is contraindicated, a V/Q scan is an alternative.
3. If you are hemodynamically unstable or there is high suspicion for massive PE, clinicians may give anticoagulation immediately and consider urgent bedside echocardiogram for RV dilation; thrombolysis is considered for massive PE with shock. If stable, they usually image first.
4. Serial troponin measurements and repeat ECGs to assess for evolving acute coronary syndrome. Cardiology consult and bedside echocardiogram may be done if cardiac cause suspected.
5. Basic labs including BMP/creatinine (for CT contrast), CBC, coagulation, and pregnancy test if applicable.
6. If PE confirmed, anticoagulation is started and further assessment for clot source and risk factors is done.

What you can expect and what you should tell the team
- Ask for CT pulmonary angiography if they haven’t decided and your kidney function is OK.  
- Tell them about any birth control, recent immobility/surgery, known clotting disorders, or family history of clots.  
- If you feel worse (faint, very short of breath, very low blood pressure, or severe ongoing pain), say so immediately.

Post‑endoscopy bacteremia is possible but less likely to produce rigors so quickly after a short procedure.

Immediate actions your care team should take (these are urgent):
- If the transfusion is still running: stop it immediately and keep IV access open with normal saline.  
- Notify the blood bank/transfusion service right away. Return the blood bag and tubing for culture/testing.  
- Send blood cultures from you and from the transfused unit; send a urine sample (for hemoglobin), and draw labs: CBC, CMP (creatinine, liver tests), coagulation panel, lactate, plasma free hemoglobin, LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin, and a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test.  
- Monitor vital signs continuously; treat hypotension with IV fluids and vasopressors if needed.  
- If there are signs of sepsis (rigors, fever, hypotension, rising lactate) start empiric broad‑spectrum IV antibiotics promptly per hospital/sepsis protocol while cultures are pending.  
- For a mild febrile non‑hemolytic reaction, acetaminophen can be given for fever and symptoms may resolve; however, FNHTR is a diagnosis of exclusion and you must exclude hemolysis or sepsis first.

Over the past week, I began having a fever and severe leg pain that disrupted my sleep at night. My temperature was measured at 38.3°C (100.9°F), and my heart rate was noted to be 120 beats per minute, with my breathing rate at 30 breaths per minute.

During the examination, the doctor observed swelling in my neck and armpits, known as lymphadenopathy. I did not have any tenderness in my abdomen, but the doctor found that my liver was enlarged, extending 3 cm below the right rib cage, and my spleen was also enlarged, extending 2 cm below the left rib cage. 

After some tests were conducted, the findings suggested that my blood counts were notably abnormal, indicating low hemoglobin and platelet levels. A bone marrow aspirate was performed, which showed a predominance of immature cells that tested positive for specific markers. 

Based on these observations and the results, the physician indicated that a diagnosis would be made from this information.","A. Leukemoid reaction B. Hodgkin lymphoma C. Hairy cell leukemia D.

64,"I am a 33-year-old woman who recently experienced a 4-day history of fever and neck pain radiating to my jaw and ears. Along with this discomfort, I noticed swelling in the front part of my throat since the pain began. Over the past 2 days, I have felt increasingly anxious and have been sweating profusely. 

I have no history of major illness and do not take any medications. When I visited my physician, my temperature was measured at 38.1°C (100.6°F), my pulse was at 95 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was 140/70 mm Hg. During the examination, the doctor noted that my palms were moist, and I exhibited a bilateral fine resting tremor in my outstretched hands. Upon further examination of my neck, the doctor found my thyroid gland to be tender, firm, and enlarged. 

These symptoms prompted further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of my condition.",A. Subacute thyroiditis B. Hashimoto thyroiditis C. Graves disease D. Thyroid lymphoma E. Struma ovarii F. Factitious hyperthyroidism G. Toxic adenoma,A,Subacute thyroiditis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: subacute (de Quervain) granulomatous thyroiditis.

Why: the combination of a tender, firm, diffusely enlarged thyroid after a prodromal febrile illness, with systemic symptoms of thyrotoxicosis (anxiety, sweating, fine resting tremor, mild tachycardia) is classic for subacute thyroiditis. The disorder is caused by inflammation of the thyroid (often post‑viral), which causes release of preformed thyroid hormone (transient thyrotoxicosis) rather than increased hormone production.

What you would expect on testing
- TSH: suppressed; free T4 and T3: elevated in the early (thyrotoxic) phase.
- ESR/CRP: markedly elevated.
- Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU): low (distinguishes thyroiditis from Graves’ disease).
- Thyroid antibodies (anti‑TPO, TSI): usually absent or low/negative.
- Thyroid ultrasound: diffusely heterogeneous, hypoechoic areas.

Typical course
- Initial thyrotoxic phase lasting several weeks due to release of stored hormone.
- Often followed by a transient hypothyroid phase (weeks–months) as stores are depleted.
- Most patients recover to euthyroidism over weeks to months; a minority develop permanent hypothyroidism.

Treatment
- First line for pain/inflammation: NSAIDs (ibuprofen or naproxen).  
- If pain or systemic inflammation is severe or not controlled with NSAIDs: a short course of oral glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) is effective.  
- For symptomatic control of thyrotoxicosis (palpitations, tremor, anxiety): a beta‑blocker (eg, propranolol).  
- Do not use antithyroid drugs (methimazole/PTU) because hormone is released, not overproduced.  
- Monitor thyroid function tests periodically; treat persistent hypothyroidism with levothyroxine if it occurs.

When to seek urgent care
- Increasing neck swelling causing difficulty breathing or swallowing, very high fever, severe palpitations, dizziness, or fainting.

Follow-up
- Repeat TSH/free T4 in 4–6 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen; consider endocrine referral if diagnosis unclear, symptoms severe, or abnormal thyroid function persists.

65,"I am a 27-year-old woman who recently visited the emergency department due to pain in multiple joints. The pain began yesterday and has progressively worsened, affecting my wrists, elbows, and shoulders symmetrically. Along with the joint pain, I experienced a subjective fever and some fatigue, but I did not have any other symptoms. I work as a schoolteacher and generally consider myself healthy. I am currently sexually active with two male partners and use condoms occasionally.

During my visit, my temperature was recorded at 100°F, and my blood pressure was 122/85 mmHg. My pulse was 88 beats per minute, my respirations were 14 per minute, and my oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. The physical examination revealed stiffness and pain in my metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, as well as my wrists. After the evaluation, I was discharged with a prescription for ibuprofen.

Four weeks later, I followed up with my primary care doctor and noted that my symptoms had improved significantly. I am no longer taking any medications for symptom control.",A. Gonococcal arthritis B. Parvovirus B19 C. Rheumatoid arthritis D. Systemic lupus erythematosus E. Transient synovitis,B,Parvovirus B19,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: acute parvovirus B19 infection causing a viral symmetric polyarthritis.

Why this fits
- Adults with parvovirus often get an abrupt, symmetric arthritis of the small joints (MCP, PIP, wrists) that mimics early rheumatoid arthritis and is frequently accompanied by fever and fatigue.
- Your occupation (schoolteacher) is a classic exposure risk because children commonly spread parvovirus.
- The illness is usually self-limited and often improves over days–weeks, which matches your recovery in about 4 weeks.

Other considerations (less likely)
- Disseminated gonococcal infection can cause arthritis in sexually active adults, but it typically produces an asymmetric, migratory oligoarthritis with tenosynovitis and sometimes skin lesions — a different pattern from yours.
- Early rheumatoid arthritis, other viral arthritides (rubella, hepatitis B/C, HIV, chikungunya) are possible but less likely given the abrupt onset, exposure history, and relatively rapid resolution.

Recommended next steps
1. Testing to confirm cause:
   - Parvovirus B19 IgM and IgG serology (IgM = recent infection).
   - Pregnancy test now if there’s any chance you could be pregnant (parvovirus infection in pregnancy can risk fetal hydrops; prompt obstetric follow-up is required if positive).
2. Given sexual history, consider STI testing (NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia, HIV, syphilis) even though your joint symptoms improved — discuss with your primary care provider.
3. If symptoms recur or persist beyond ~6 weeks, get inflammatory and autoimmune testing (ESR/CRP, RF, anti-CCP) and consider rheumatology referral to evaluate for persistent inflammatory arthritis.

Management
- Supportive care (NSAIDs like ibuprofen for pain and inflammation) is standard for parvovirus arthritis. Most adults recover without disease-modifying therapy.
- If pregnant and infected, obstetric management and possible fetal monitoring are needed.
- Practice safer sex (consistent condom use) and get STI screening as recommended.

66,"I am a 59-year-old man who recently visited my primary care physician due to feelings of fatigue. Although I generally have been in good health, I noticed some weight loss and abdominal pain, which contributed to my overall sense of exhaustion. My medical history includes anxiety, diabetes, and a foot fracture I sustained after tripping. Recently, I also had a cold that kept me from work for a week.

During my appointment, I shared my symptoms, and my physician noted my vital signs. My temperature was slightly elevated at 99.5°F, and my blood pressure measured 150/100 mmHg.

My current medications include metformin, insulin, buspirone, vitamin D, calcium, and sodium docusate. Following the examination, my physician ordered laboratory tests to further investigate my condition.",A. Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia C. Chronic myeloid leukemia D. Leukemoid reaction E. Multiple myeloma,D,Leukemoid reaction,neutral,"Thanks — I can help, but I don’t yet have a clear question. Here are two useful ways I can proceed; tell me which you want (or both):

A. Explain which tests your doctor probably ordered and why (and what abnormal results would suggest).  
B. Give a prioritized differential diagnosis and recommended next steps (including urgent “red flags” that would need immediate evaluation).

Below is a concise combined summary you can use now (covers A + B).

Key possibilities based on your history (59, diabetes, weight loss, abdominal pain, low‑grade fever, new systolic murmur, fatigue)
- Infection/endocarditis (fever + new murmur + weight loss)—less likely without higher fever but should be considered.  
- Diabetes-related causes: poor glycemic control causing catabolism/weight loss, or complications of diabetes.  
- Malignancy (pancreas, GI) — explains weight loss + abdominal pain in an older smoker or drinker (ask about risk factors).  
- Hyperthyroidism or other endocrine causes (weight loss + fatigue).  
- Medication/nutritional causes (metformin → B12 deficiency; poor intake/malabsorption).  
- Chronic infection or inflammatory disease.

Common initial tests and what they look for
- CBC (complete blood count): infection/anemia/marrow problem.  
- CMP (electrolytes, kidney, liver tests, glucose, calcium): basic organ function, liver metastases, dehydration.  
- HbA1c and fasting/random glucose: overall diabetes control (uncontrolled diabetes can cause weight loss).  
- TSH (thyroid): hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss and fatigue.  
- B12 level (and folate if indicated): metformin can cause B12 deficiency → fatigue, neuropathy.  
- CRP or ESR: nonspecific inflammation/possible infection or malignancy.  
- Blood cultures (if your physician suspects endocarditis or systemic infection) — especially with fever + murmur.  
- Urinalysis and urine culture: urinary infection can cause fatigue and fever.  
- Lipase/amylase if abdominal pain suggests pancreatitis.  
- Stool occult blood (or GI evaluation) if unexplained weight loss and abdominal symptoms.  
- Hepatitis/HIV testing if risk factors and unexplained systemic symptoms.

Imaging and targeted tests (based on exam/labs)
- Abdominal ultrasound or CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast — to evaluate organs (pancreas, liver, biliary tree, masses).  
- Chest x‑ray — infection or malignancy screening.  
- Echocardiogram (TTE; consider TEE if high suspicion) — if murmur + fever/weight loss to evaluate for endocarditis or valvular disease.  
- Colonoscopy if GI bleeding, change in bowel habits, or age‑appropriate cancer screening not up to date.

Medication review
- Metformin: consider B12 level.  
- Insulin/metformin dosing and recent glucose logs — poor control can cause weight loss.  
- Buspirone and other meds may cause fatigue but not usually weight loss/fever.

Red flags that require urgent care / ER
- Persistent high fever (>101°F/38.3°C), rigors, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, chest pain, shortness of breath, new neurological deficits, severe worsening abdominal pain, or signs of sepsis.  
- New, progressive murmur with fever or embolic phenomena (stroke, unexplained limb ischemia) — urgent evaluation for endocarditis.

What to do next / what to tell your doctor
- Ask that they draw the labs above (CBC, CMP, HbA1c, TSH, B12, CRP/ESR, urinalysis) and obtain abdominal imaging if abdominal pain and weight loss are unexplained.  
- If they’re concerned about infection or the murmur, request blood cultures and an echocardiogram.  
- Bring a list of symptoms (duration and amount of weight loss, bowel habit changes, fevers, night sweats, smoking/alcohol history, recent infections, glucose readings).

If you want, tell me: how much weight have you lost and over what timeframe, details of the abdominal pain (location, severity, relation to eating), your recent glucose readings and A1c (if known), and whether you have fever or night sweats. I can then give a narrower differential and what specific abnormal results would suggest.",Leukemoid reaction,False,False,False,False,False
67,"I am a 55-year-old female who recently sought medical attention due to recurrent episodes of abdominal discomfort and pain over the past month. The pain typically starts about 2-3 hours after meals and often occurs around midnight. When it happens, I would describe the intensity as moderate to severe. Alongside this, I have been experiencing constant fatigue.

In terms of my medical history, there have been no significant issues. I work as an office secretary, and I have noticed that my job has been particularly stressful lately. During my visit, my vital signs were recorded: my temperature was 98.6°F, my respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute, my pulse was 67 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was 122/98 mm Hg. My body mass index (BMI) was noted to be 34.

During the physical examination, the doctor observed conjunctival pallor and mild tenderness in my epigastric region. This combination of symptoms and findings led to further discussion regarding potential diagnoses for my condition.",A. Acute cholecystitis B. Choledocholithiasis C. Pancreatitis D. Duodenal peptic ulcer E. Gallbladder cancer,D,Duodenal peptic ulcer,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- A duodenal peptic ulcer (peptic ulcer disease, PUD) — classically causes epigastric pain 2–3 hours after eating and nocturnal pain. Your epigastric tenderness plus nocturnal pain/2–3 hr timing fits this pattern.  
- Conjunctival pallor and fatigue strongly suggest iron‑deficiency anemia from chronic gastrointestinal blood loss from an ulcer.

Why this over other causes
- Gastric ulcer pain is often worsened by eating (rather than delayed) and has a higher malignancy risk; gastritis can cause similar discomfort but usually less well‑localized/less classically nocturnal; biliary or pancreatic causes have different timing/localization and associated labs/imaging. Your anemia is an important “alarm” sign that requires endoscopic evaluation.

Recommended next steps (concise)
1. Urgent gastroenterology referral for upper endoscopy (EGD) — because of anemia (an alarm feature) you should be scoped and lesions biopsied to confirm an ulcer, assess for active bleeding, and rule out malignancy.  
2. Labs now: CBC with indices, iron studies (ferritin, iron, TIBC), stool occult blood (guaiac/FOBT).  
3. Test for H. pylori: during EGD (biopsy urease test / histology) is preferred when doing endoscopy. If EGD is delayed, noninvasive testing (urea breath test or stool antigen) can be used — avoid starting proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for at least 2 weeks before these tests if possible because they reduce sensitivity.  
4. Management: if bleeding/urgent findings on EGD treat accordingly. If PUD is confirmed and H. pylori positive, give guideline-directed eradication therapy (PPI plus antibiotics — regimen chosen based on local resistance and prior macrolide exposure). Start iron replacement if iron deficiency confirmed. Avoid NSAIDs and smoking. Short-term PPI may be started empirically if GI bleeding is suspected, but ideally after coordinating testing/EGD.

When to seek immediate care
- New or worsening vomiting, black/tarry stools, fainting, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, or severe persistent pain — these suggest active bleeding or complication and require emergency care.

I have a medical history of diabetes and a significant smoking history of 35 pack-years. Recently, I started boxing as a way to get into shape. 

When I arrived at the emergency department, my vital signs were within normal limits. During the physical examination, the healthcare provider noted the mass on my elbow. It was described as rubbery and non-tender. I am now awaiting further evaluation to determine the most likely diagnosis of this unexpected condition.",A. Abscess B. Hematoma C. Leiomyoma D. Lipoma E. Sebaceous cyst,D,Lipoma,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: olecranon bursitis (inflammation/collection in the bursa over the back of the elbow), most likely aseptic from recent repetitive trauma (you mentioned starting boxing).

Why this fits:
- Location: a new swelling directly over the elbow (posterior olecranon) is classic for the olecranon bursa.
- Character: bursitis can present as a rubbery/soft, non‑tender, fluctuant mass, especially when not infected.
- History: repetitive trauma or blunt blows (which can occur with new boxing) commonly causes aseptic bursitis.
- Risk factors to note: your diabetes raises the risk of septic bursitis, so infection must be considered even if you currently have no systemic signs.

Important next steps (what the ED will likely do or you should expect):
- Focused exam: look for erythema, warmth, fever, increasing pain, limited ROM.
- Ultrasound can distinguish a fluid‑filled bursa from a solid mass (lipoma, tumor).
- If there is concern for infection or large/tense swelling, aspiration of bursal fluid for cell count, Gram stain/culture and crystal analysis is indicated.
- Management:
  - If aseptic and not bothersome: rest, avoid pressure, compression wrap, NSAIDs, ice.
  - If tense or symptomatic: aspiration can relieve symptoms.
  - If septic bursitis suspected/confirmed (fever, erythema, high WBC in fluid, positive cultures) start appropriate antibiotics (covering Staphylococcus species; consider MRSA based on local patterns) and sometimes surgical drainage.
  - Recurrent bursitis may require steroid injection or surgical bursectomy.

When to seek urgent care: fever, rapidly increasing pain/swelling, spreading redness, drainage, or systemic symptoms.

If you want, tell me exactly where on the elbow the lump is (posterior tip vs medial vs lateral) and whether the skin is red/warm or you have fever — that will help narrow the likelihood further and guide whether aspiration or antibiotics are needed.",Lipoma,False,True,False,False,True

This weakness persisted for roughly three hours before I began to feel normal again while I was in the car on my way to the hospital.

At the emergency department, I underwent a thorough physical and neurological examination, which did not reveal any abnormalities. I was able to move all my limbs without issue, exhibiting full strength in both my upper and lower extremities. My medical history includes a 20-year history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

I had a noncontrast CT scan of my head performed as part of the evaluation.",A. Acute limb ischemia B. Intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke C. Ischemic stroke D. Subarachnoid hemorrhage E. Transient ischemic attack,E,Transient ischemic attack,neutral,"Thanks — this sounds most consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Key points and what I’d recommend next:

Why TIA is likely
- Sudden focal weakness of one leg that resolved within a few hours fits the classic definition of a TIA (neurologic deficit from temporary brain ischemia that resolves, usually <24 hours).  
- Your long-standing hypertension and hyperlipidemia increase your risk.  
- A noncontrast head CT is commonly done in the ED to exclude a hemorrhage; it is often normal after a TIA and cannot reliably exclude small or recent ischemia.

Short-term risk
- Using the ABCD2 score (Age ≥60 =1, Blood pressure ≥140/90 =1, Clinical features: unilateral weakness =2, Duration 3 hours =2, Diabetes not reported =0) gives a score of 6 — this indicates a relatively high short-term risk of stroke in the next days to weeks, so urgent evaluation and treatment are important.

Recommended urgent work-up (if not already done)
- Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) — more sensitive than CT to detect acute ischemia.  
- Vascular imaging of head and neck (CT angiography or MR angiography; carotid duplex ultrasound) to look for carotid or intracranial stenosis.  
- Cardiac evaluation: ECG immediately and cardiac rhythm monitoring (telemetry or 24–48 hour Holter) to detect atrial fibrillation; consider transthoracic (or transesophageal, if indicated) echo for a cardiac source of embolus.  
- Routine labs (glucose, lipids, CBC, coagulation as directed).

Immediate treatment and secondary prevention
- If atrial fibrillation is found, anticoagulation is usually indicated.  
- If no AF and no contraindication, start antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or aspirin + clopidogrel short-term per clinician decision).  
- Start a high-intensity statin (e.g., atorvastatin) for secondary prevention.  
- Optimize blood pressure control and other risk factors (smoking cessation, diabetes control, diet, exercise).  
- If significant carotid stenosis is discovered and you are a candidate, urgent referral for carotid endarterectomy or stenting may be needed.

When to seek emergency care
- If you experience any new focal neurologic symptoms (weakness, numbness, slurred speech, vision loss, severe new headache, imbalance), call 911 immediately.

Cytomegalovirus infection D. Epstein-barr virus infection E. Disseminated gonococcemia,C,Cytomegalovirus infection,neutral,"Thanks — this is a helpful summary. I can’t make a definitive diagnosis from this information, but here’s what’s most likely and what I’d recommend next.

What your findings mean (brief)
- Fever, cough, fatigue, myalgias and decreased appetite for a week point toward an infectious cause — most commonly a viral respiratory infection (influenza or COVID-19) or an “atypical” respiratory infection (e.g., Mycoplasma).  
- Elevated white blood cell count suggests an inflammatory or infectious process (can be bacterial or viral).  
- Mildly elevated liver enzymes (LFTs) mean the liver is affected; many systemic viral infections (EBV, CMV, acute HIV, influenza, COVID-19), some medications, or less commonly acute viral hepatitis can do this.

Most relevant possibilities
- Viral respiratory illness (influenza, SARS-CoV-2) — common, fits fever, cough, myalgias; LFTs can be mildly elevated.  
- Atypical pneumonia (Mycoplasma) — cough, prolonged symptoms; can cause mild LFT abnormalities.  
- Infectious mononucleosis syndromes: EBV or CMV — can cause fatigue, fever and elevated LFTs; EBV often has sore throat/lymphadenopathy but CMV can present without sore throat.  
- Acute HIV seroconversion illness — can present with fever, fatigue, myalgias and abnormal LFTs; consider testing if recent sexual exposure puts you at risk.  
- Less likely: bacterial pneumonia, acute viral hepatitis (if risk factors), drug/alcohol-related liver injury.

Recommended next steps (discuss with your provider)
- Test for common respiratory viruses: SARS‑CoV‑2 PCR/antigen and influenza test. Many clinics can do multiplex respiratory PCR.  
- CBC with differential (to look for lymphocytosis/atypical lymphocytes) and repeat CMP/LFTs.  
- Chest X‑ray if cough is productive, you have abnormal lung exam, shortness of breath, or fever persists/worsens — to evaluate for pneumonia.  
- Serologic/viral tests as indicated: EBV panel, CMV IgM/IgG (or PCR if available), HIV antigen/antibody test, and a hepatitis panel if risk factors or persistent LFT rise.  
- Consider Mycoplasma testing if atypical pneumonia suspected (clinical judgment).  
- If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, your provider may start empiric antibiotics (often covering atypical organisms, e.g., azithromycin) pending results.

Immediate self-care and precautions
- Rest, stay hydrated, acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever/body aches.  
- Avoid alcohol and unnecessary hepatotoxic medications while LFTs are elevated.  
- Isolate/mask until you know whether you have COVID-19 or influenza to avoid spreading infection.  
- Monitor symptoms: check for worsening cough, new shortness of breath, high fevers, chest pain, confusion, or yellowing of skin/eyes.

When to seek urgent care or the ER
- Difficulty breathing, persistent or worsening high fever, chest pain, fainting/confusion, inability to drink/keep fluids down, or signs of worsening liver disease (jaundice, very dark urine, severe abdominal pain).

Sexual-contact note
- Because you mentioned a girlfriend, if you had any recent unprotected sexual contact with new partners or partners with unknown status, it’s reasonable to do an HIV test and other STI screening. If you’re monogamous and both tested negative recently, the immediate risk is lower — but acute HIV can present like a flu/mono illness, so testing is still prudent if there’s any uncertainty.

Bottom line
- The most likely causes are viral respiratory infection (influenza/COVID) or an atypical respiratory infection, but the elevated LFTs broaden the possibilities to include EBV, CMV or acute HIV. Ask your provider for respiratory viral testing, CBC with differential, repeat LFTs, chest X‑ray if indicated, and targeted serologies (EBV/CMV/HIV/hepatitis) based on risk. If symptoms worsen, seek urgent care.

71,"I am a 78-year-old man, and I was brought to the emergency department by my daughter after experiencing a diffuse headache for one day. Along with the headache, I noticed that I was having difficulty understanding speech. I have no history of head trauma, and I typically drink one to two beers daily, occasionally more on weekends. 

Upon arrival, my vital signs were taken and found to be within normal limits. During the mental status examination, I was able to speak fluently; however, my speech did not make sense, and I struggled to repeat sentences. 

To further investigate my condition, a noncontrast CT scan of my head was performed. The results indicated an acute hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, along with several small, older hemorrhages in both occipital lobes. 

The medical team is now evaluating these findings to determine the underlying cause of my neurological symptoms.",A. Vascular lipohyalinosis B. Ruptured vascular malformation C. Hypertensive encephalopathy D. Intracerebral malignancy E. Cardiac embolism F. Amyloid angiopathy,F,Amyloid angiopathy,neutral,"What your exam and CT mean
- Your language pattern (fluent but nonsensical speech, poor comprehension and repetition) is classic for a receptive/Wernicke aphasia — this localizes to the dominant (usually left) posterior temporal lobe. That matches the acute left temporal lobe bleed seen on CT and explains your speech problems.
- The presence of several small, older hemorrhages in both occipital lobes in an elderly patient points to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) as the most likely underlying cause. CAA is caused by beta‑amyloid deposition in small cortical/leptomeningeal vessels, which makes them prone to recurrent lobar (cortical) hemorrhages, often in the occipital and parietal lobes. This pattern is different from hypertensive bleeds, which tend to occur in deep structures (basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, cerebellum).

Immediate and next steps (what the team will likely do)
- Neurology and/or neurosurgery consultation to decide if any surgical intervention is needed (depends on size, mass effect, clinical status).
- MRI with susceptibility-weighted or GRE sequences to look for additional microbleeds and better characterize chronic hemorrhages.
- Blood tests: coagulation studies and review of all medications (stop anticoagulants/antiplatelets if present; reverse if the patient is on warfarin/DOACs and bleeding is ongoing).
- Blood‑pressure control and close neurologic monitoring to prevent expansion of the bleed.
- Avoid thrombolysis (tPA) and generally avoid future anticoagulation if CAA is confirmed unless absolutely necessary because of high rebleed risk.
- Supportive care and early speech therapy; counseling about increased risk of future lobar bleeds and possible association with cognitive decline/Alzheimer pathology.

72,"I am a 23-year-old man who recently visited the emergency department due to a severe headache. I described to the medical staff that I experience sudden, intense pain across my face whenever anything touches it. This includes activities as simple as shaving or applying lotion. I characterized the pain as electric, noting that it worsens with any form of contact. At the time of my visit, I was pain-free, but the prospect of touch caused significant anxiety.

During my assessment, my vital signs were recorded: my temperature was 98.1°F, blood pressure measured 127/81 mmHg, my pulse was 87 beats per minute, my respirations were 15 per minute, and my oxygen saturation was at 98% while breathing room air. The neurological examination appeared normal; however, I experienced severe pain when the doctor performed light palpation of my face. I requested morphine for my pain, hoping for relief from the discomfort I was experiencing. The medical team discussed my symptoms in detail to determine a potential diagnosis based on the information I provided.",A. Cluster headache B. Malingering C. Migraine headache D. Tension headache E. Trigeminal neuralgia,E,Trigeminal neuralgia,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux).  
Why: sudden, electric/shocklike facial pains triggered by light touch (shaving, lotion), pain-free between attacks, normal exam except for trigger-point pain — all classic for trigeminal neuralgia.

Important caveats for your age: classic trigeminal neuralgia is more common in older adults. Because you’re young (23), a “secondary” cause (most commonly multiple sclerosis or a structural lesion compressing the nerve) is more likely than in an older patient. That means further testing is important.

Recommended next steps
- Urgent MRI brain with and without contrast focused on the posterior fossa/trigeminal nerve to look for demyelinating plaques, tumors, vascular compression, or other structural causes.
- Neurology referral for confirmation and management.

Initial treatment (start after discussing with clinician)
- First-line medication: carbamazepine (effective for trigeminal neuralgia). Typical starting dose is low and titrated (examples: 100–200 mg twice daily, increasing as needed); many patients require 400–1200 mg/day. Monitor CBC, liver enzymes, and sodium. Test HLA‑B*1502 before starting if you are of Han Chinese or certain Southeast Asian ancestry (risk of Stevens–Johnson syndrome).
- Oxcarbazepine is an alternative (fewer blood dyscrasias; watch for hyponatremia).
- Gabapentin or pregabalin may help if first-line agents aren’t tolerated, but they’re generally less effective.
- Opioids (eg, morphine) are generally not effective for trigeminal neuralgia and aren’t recommended as first-line therapy.

If medications fail or cause intolerable side effects
- Neurology/neurosurgery options: microvascular decompression (if vascular compression found), percutaneous procedures (balloon compression, glycerol rhizotomy), or stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife).

When to seek immediate care
- New or worsening neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, visual changes), fever or rash, sudden bilateral facial pain, or severe uncontrolled pain.

Questions your clinician should ask / you should be ready to report
- Is the pain on one side only or both? Which branches of the face (forehead, cheek, jaw)? How long do attacks last? Any prior rash, recent dental work, or other neurological symptoms? Any family history of MS?

If you want, tell me whether the pain is strictly on one side and which part of the face is affected, and your ancestry (for HLA‑B*1502 testing), and I can give more tailored advice.",Malingering,True,True,True,True,True
73,"I am a 27-year-old woman and recently experienced significant weakness in my legs, which progressed to the point where I could no longer stand. I work as a school teacher in Alaska and enjoy hiking and camping. Not long ago, I returned from a camping trip where I hiked through tall brush and drank from mountain streams. 

Two days prior to my hospital visit, I was involved in a motor vehicle accident but did not seek treatment at that time. My medical history has been unremarkable, and I take multivitamins. Aside from a recent episode of diarrhea, I generally consider myself healthy. 

When I arrived at the emergency department, my temperature was slightly elevated at 99.5°F, and my blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate were within normal limits. However, I was anxious and exhibited very weak strength in my lower extremities, rated at 1/5, and 2/5 in my trunk muscles, along with diminished sensation. 

I also began to experience difficulty breathing, which prompted further evaluation. As my condition progressed, I was intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for closer monitoring and treatment.",A. Female sex living in a Northern latitude B. Hiking in tick-infested woods C. Consuming meats cooked over a campfire D. Pelvic trauma E. Central cervical spine trauma,C,Consuming meats cooked over a campfire,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.

Why this fits
- Typical preceding diarrheal illness (Campylobacter jejuni is a common trigger).
- Symmetric, progressive weakness beginning in the legs and trunk with sensory loss.
- Rapid progression to respiratory muscle weakness requiring intubation — classic for severe GBS.

Important immediate steps (urgently)
1. Admit to ICU (already there) and continue close monitoring of respiratory and autonomic function.
2. Neurology consult now.
3. Start disease‑modifying therapy promptly — IV immunoglobulin (IVIG 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) OR plasmapheresis (both are effective; do not combine). Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting confirmatory tests if clinical suspicion is high.
4. Serial respiratory measurements (FVC, negative inspiratory force); intubation thresholds are low — continue ventilatory support as needed.
5. Supportive care: DVT prophylaxis, pain control, prevention of pressure injuries, early mobilization/physiotherapy when stable, nutritional support.
6. Diagnostics to confirm and stage:
   - Lumbar puncture: albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal/low WBC) after about a week.
   - Nerve conduction studies / EMG: demyelination pattern (slowed conduction, conduction block).
   - Baseline labs and ECG for autonomic monitoring.

Key differentials to consider
- Tick paralysis (relevant given recent hiking/camping): look carefully for an attached tick — removal usually leads to rapid improvement.
- Spinal cord injury/compression from the car crash: consider urgent MRI of spine if focal level, sensory level, asymmetric findings, or if exam/localization suggests cord lesion.
- Botulism or myasthenia gravis are less likely given the sensory loss and preceding diarrhea.

Prognosis
- Many patients recover well over weeks to months; about two‑thirds regain near‑baseline strength, but some have prolonged deficits. Early treatment and ICU support reduce complications.

74,"I am a 62-year-old woman who had been taking amoxicillin for acute sinusitis for 12 days. During this time, I developed a macular rash on my neck, back, and torso. As a result, my doctor switched my medication to cephalexin for another week. The rash resolved after this change; however, I soon began experiencing fatigue, flank pain, and a fever that persisted even after the sinusitis had cleared. 

I have a medical history that includes essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux, for which I have been consistently taking lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole.

Acute tubular necrosis D. Acute vascular injury E. IgA nephropathy,A,Acute interstitial nephritis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), probably caused by the recent beta‑lactam antibiotics.

Why: AIN classically presents with fever, rash, and acute kidney injury after recent drug exposure. Your labs fit — rising BUN/creatinine, sterile pyuria, and eosinophiluria on Hansel stain (the “binucleated cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm” are urinary eosinophils). A negative urine culture argues against simple pyelonephritis. PPIs can also cause AIN, but the timing here points to the recent antibiotics.

Recommended next steps
- Stop the offending drug(s) immediately (discontinue cephalexin/amoxicillin). Avoid other potentially nephrotoxic medications (NSAIDs).
- Notify your prescriber and get an urgent nephrology consult.
- Monitor renal function and urine output closely (daily creatinine until improving).
- If renal function does not begin to improve within 48–72 hours after stopping the drug, or if AKI is severe, nephrology will likely recommend a kidney biopsy to confirm AIN and often will start corticosteroids (commonly prednisone ~0.5–1 mg/kg/day with a taper) to speed recovery.
- If antibiotics are still needed, use an alternative class that is unlikely to cross‑react and discuss allergy history with your clinician.

Prognosis: many patients recover partially or completely, especially when the offending drug is stopped promptly, but delayed treatment can result in persistent renal impairment. Follow up with nephrology/primary care is important.",Acute glomerulonephritis,True,True,True,True,True
75,"I was brought to the emergency room by my mother because I was experiencing altered mental status. Over the past month, I had been struggling with my high school exams, and my mother noticed a decline in my attention and memory. She had to repeat conversations that we had just had hours before. This morning, I woke up feeling confused and disoriented, unsure of where I was. My mother mentioned that I am usually a bright student, enrolled in all honors classes.

My medical history includes being on a delayed vaccine schedule as a child, during which I contracted measles at age 6. Apart from that, I have been healthy, with no chronic conditions, and I only take a daily multivitamin. My maternal grandfather has Huntington disease. When I arrived at the hospital, my temperature was measured at 99°F, blood pressure was 110/82 mmHg, and my pulse was 86 beats per minute. During the examination, I was disoriented to time and place, and my mental status exam scored 16 out of 30.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,E,Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a progressive, usually fatal, post‑measles infection of the central nervous system.

Why: SSPE classically presents in children/teens months–years after wild‑type measles with progressive cognitive decline and behavioral change, then disorientation and periodic myoclonus. Your history of measles as a child and a subacute course of cognitive deterioration followed by myoclonic jerks fit well. The normal/low‑grade fever, acute presentation after weeks–months, and your vaccination history support this more than vaccine‑related encephalitis. Huntington disease is unlikely given age and clinical features. Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is rare in this age group.

Next steps (urgent)
- Neurology consult now.
- EEG: look for characteristic periodic, high‑amplitude generalized complexes time‑locked to myoclonic jerks.
- MRI brain: often shows white matter and cortical changes.
- Lumbar puncture: send CSF and serum for measles (rubeola) IgG/IgM and oligoclonal bands; elevated measles antibody index in CSF is diagnostic.
- Basic labs/infectious workup and autoimmune encephalitis panel as part of the differential.

Treatment and prognosis
- There is no reliably curative therapy. Antiviral/immune therapies (intraventricular or intrathecal interferon‑alpha, oral inosiplex/inosine pranobex) have been used and may slow progression in some patients, but overall prognosis is poor and disease is often fatal over months–years.

There has been no hoarseness or weight loss accompanying these symptoms. 

For the past two years, I have been dealing with heartburn, which has not improved despite taking high doses of omeprazole.

I am seeking to understand what might be causing these swallowing difficulties and the ongoing heartburn, especially since my current treatment does not seem effective.",A. Achalasia B. Diffuse esophageal spasm C. Eosinophilic esophagitis D. Esophageal reflux disease E. Schatzki’s ring,C,Eosinophilic esophagitis,neutral,"The pattern you describe—intermittent trouble swallowing solid food (feels like it gets stuck in the chest, no problems with liquids), episodes of food “sticking,” a two‑year history of heartburn that has not improved on high‑dose omeprazole, plus a personal history of asthma and eczema—points most strongly toward eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Other possibilities to consider are a Schatzki ring or peptic stricture from reflux, and (less likely given your age and lack of weight loss) malignancy or a primary motility disorder.

Why EoE is most likely
- EoE commonly affects younger to middle‑aged men and typically causes dysphagia to solids and food impaction.  
- It is strongly associated with atopic diseases (asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis).  
- It can present with heartburn or be mistaken for reflux; some cases do not respond to PPIs.  
- Endoscopically EoE may show rings, linear furrows, white exudates or strictures; diagnosis requires mucosal biopsies showing eosinophil‑predominant inflammation.

Other likely causes
- Schatzki ring or peptic stricture: intermittent solid food dysphagia and history of reflux make this plausible. These are often seen at the squamocolumnar junction and may respond to dilation ± acid suppression.  
- Motility disorders (achalasia, spasm) usually cause solids and liquids to be affected and are less likely here.  
- Esophageal cancer is unlikely given your age and lack of alarm features, but is considered if symptoms progress.

Recommended next steps (what I’d advise)
1. See a gastroenterologist for upper endoscopy (EGD) with multiple esophageal biopsies. This is the key test to confirm or exclude EoE and to look for rings/strictures that can be dilated during the procedure.  
2. If EGD is normal but symptoms persist, consider a barium swallow (esophagram) to detect subtle rings or diverticula, and high‑resolution esophageal manometry to assess motility.  
3. For evaluation of true acid reflux as the cause of your ongoing heartburn despite PPI, ambulatory pH (or pH‑impedance) testing can be done—this usually requires stopping acid suppression beforehand (discuss timing with GI).  
4. If EoE is diagnosed, standard treatments include swallowed topical corticosteroids (eg, budesonide slurry or swallowed fluticasone), dietary elimination strategies guided by an allergy specialist, and dilation if strictures are present. If a Schatzki ring or peptic stricture is found, endoscopic dilation plus optimal reflux control is the usual treatment.

When to seek more urgent care
- If you develop complete food impaction (unable to swallow saliva), progressive difficulty swallowing liquids, unintentional weight loss, bleeding, or severe odynophagia — seek urgent GI evaluation or the emergency department.

Bottom line
Your history and atopic background make eosinophilic esophagitis the leading possibility, with reflux‑related ring/stricture also a strong contender. The most important next step is referral for upper endoscopy with biopsies so the exact cause can be identified and treated appropriately.",Diffuse esophageal spasm,True,True,False,True,True
77,"I am a 56-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department by my husband due to experiencing slurred speech and a droop on the left side of my face for about 30 minutes. During this time, I also felt numbness on the left side of my face. I had never encountered such an episode before. My medical history includes hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recently, my father passed away from lung cancer, which has been difficult for me. 

I have been a smoker for 30 years, consuming one pack of cigarettes daily, and I typically drink one glass of wine each day.

Transient ischemic attack F. Multiple sclerosis,E,Transient ischemic attack,neutral,"Likely diagnosis
- This sounds most consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA): a brief, focal neurologic deficit from temporary cerebral ischemia that resolved within minutes. Your vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, 30‑pack‑year smoking history, obesity) and the new carotid bruit make a vascular cause much more likely than Bell’s palsy or a purely peripheral nerve problem.

Why the CT being normal doesn’t rule out a TIA
- Noncontrast CT is mainly to exclude hemorrhage. A normal CT is common with TIA or small ischemic events. Diffusion-weighted MRI is much more sensitive for acute ischemia.

Immediate important steps you should expect now
1. Hospital admission or urgent stroke-workup as an inpatient or stroke observation unit (TIAs have a high short‑term stroke risk).
2. Start antiplatelet therapy promptly (if no contraindication). Emergency departments commonly give an aspirin loading dose, and in many patients short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) for 21 days is recommended after minor ischemic stroke/TIA.
3. Urgent investigations:
   - MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).
   - Carotid imaging (duplex ultrasound ± CTA/MRA) — your right carotid bruit raises concern for ipsilateral carotid stenosis (right carotid disease can produce left‑sided symptoms).
   - 12‑lead ECG and continuous cardiac monitoring (telemetry) to detect atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias.
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram (± bubble study) if a cardioembolic source is suspected.
   - Blood tests: glucose, electrolytes, CBC, coagulation, lipid profile, HbA1c.
4. Blood‑pressure and glucose management and continued/optimized high‑intensity statin (you are already on atorvastatin).
5. If carotid stenosis is found and it is symptomatic and severe (typically ≥70%), prompt referral to vascular surgery for carotid endarterectomy or stenting (usually within 2 weeks) may be indicated.

What is NOT indicated right now
- Thrombolytic therapy (tPA) is generally used for persistent disabling ischemic stroke and not for symptoms that have already fully resolved.
- Waiting and dismissing the episode as “stress” or Bell’s palsy would be unsafe given your risk profile.

Risk reduction and follow‑up
- Smoking cessation (very important).
- Tight control of blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes.
- Continue/optimize statin therapy. Consider antiplatelet long‑term (aspirin or clopidogrel) as advised by your stroke team.
- Neurology/vascular clinic follow‑up within days.

Bottom line
You most likely had a TIA. Although your symptoms resolved, this is a medical emergency because your risk of stroke in the short term is elevated. You should be admitted or undergo an urgent stroke evaluation (MRI brain, carotid imaging, cardiac monitoring) and start antiplatelet therapy and aggressive risk‑factor management right away.

During the neurologic examination, I mentioned a decrease in hearing in my left ear, which the staff assessed using the Weber test, confirming localization to the left side. 

As part of my evaluation, the doctors ordered serum studies, which indicated an elevated alkaline phosphatase level and a high parathyroid hormone level. Additionally, they performed an x-ray of my spine, which revealed a fracture in the L4 vertebra. 

Given these findings, the medical team began discussing potential diagnoses related to my symptoms and test results.",A. Osteitis fibrosa cystica B. Osteoporosis C. Osteomalacia D. Osteitis deformans E. Osteonecrosis F. Osteopetrosis,D,Osteitis deformans,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans).

Why this fits
- Age (70) — Paget usually affects older adults.
- Chronic right‑hip pain with local warmth/redness — Pagetic bone is hypervascular and painful, commonly involves pelvis/hip.
- Acute vertebral (L4) fracture after lifting — Pagetic bone is structurally abnormal and prone to fracture.
- Elevated alkaline phosphatase — marker of high bone turnover in Paget.
- Conductive hearing loss (Weber lateralizing to the side you say is worse) — involvement of the temporal bone produces conductive hearing loss.

Points to consider / differential
- Bone metastasis (eg, prostate) can raise ALP and cause focal pain/fracture; check PSA and consider bone scan. Metastases more commonly produce mixed or blastic lesions.
- Primary hyperparathyroidism / osteitis fibrosa cystica can cause bone pain, elevated PTH and ALP, and fractures, but typically has hypercalcemia and different radiographic features.
- Osteoporosis causes vertebral compression fractures but usually normal ALP and no focal warmth/redness or hearing loss.

Recommended next steps
- Obtain targeted imaging: pelvic/hip and skull x‑rays (Paget shows lytic + sclerotic “cotton‑wool” or mixed changes) and a radionuclide bone scan to assess extent.
- Check serum calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, creatinine, and bone‑specific ALP; repeat/verify PTH and measure PSA if prostate mets are a concern.
- Manage acute fracture/pain (analgesia, ortho/geriatric consult). If Paget confirmed, treat with bisphosphonates (IV zoledronic acid is first‑line) or calcitonin in selected cases.

Contact dermatitis,D,Drug-induced angioedema,neutral,"Your presentation is most consistent with ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema.

Why: lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) increases bradykinin levels. Bradykinin causes rapid swelling of face, lips, tongue and can compromise the airway. It commonly occurs within days to weeks (but can happen anytime), is more common in African Americans, and does not involve urticaria or itching. A normal C1 esterase inhibitor level makes hereditary or acquired C1‑inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema) unlikely.

Immediate management (what was/should be done in the ED)
- Airway is the priority: close monitoring and early involvement of anesthesia/ENT for possible intubation or tracheostomy if airway compromise progresses.  
- Stop the ACE inhibitor permanently.  
- Specific treatments for bradykinin-mediated angioedema (if available): icatibant (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist) or ecallantide (kallikrein inhibitor). Fresh frozen plasma can be used in some cases.  
- Standard allergy meds (epinephrine, antihistamines, steroids) are often ineffective for bradykinin‑mediated angioedema but are sometimes given if histamine‑mediated reaction cannot be excluded; they should not replace airway management or bradykinin‑directed therapy.

Longer-term care and precautions
- Do not restart any ACE inhibitor ever again. Document the allergy clearly in your chart and consider a medical alert.  
- Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can rarely cause angioedema too; discuss risks with your doctor — many clinicians avoid ARBs after ACE‑inhibitor angioedema, or use them cautiously.  
- For blood pressure control, alternatives include thiazide diuretics, calcium‑channel blockers, or beta blockers per your clinician’s choice.  
- Follow up with your primary care physician and consider referral to allergy/immunology or ENT for further evaluation and airway counseling.

During the physical examination, the physician noted tenderness in my right flank and observed edema in both of my legs, which extended up to my knees.

To further investigate my condition, a Doppler ultrasonography was performed. The results indicated that my right kidney was enlarged and echogenic, with an absent venous signal. Following these findings, my healthcare team began to assess the underlying cause of my condition.

Membranous nephropathy E. Penile cancer,D,Membranous nephropathy,neutral,"What you describe is most consistent with acute renal vein thrombosis (RVT) of the right kidney.

Why:
- Sudden severe loin pain with nausea/vomiting plus hematuria and proteinuria fits RVT.
- Doppler showing an enlarged, echogenic kidney with absent venous flow is typical for renal vein occlusion.
- Marked proteinuria and bilateral leg edema suggest nephrotic syndrome, the common underlying pro-thrombotic state in adults (membranous nephropathy is a frequent cause).

Immediate actions your team should take
1. Start anticoagulation promptly (unless there is a bleeding contraindication). Typical initial therapy is low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin followed by an oral anticoagulant. Early anticoagulation reduces risk of thrombus extension and pulmonary embolism and may preserve kidney function.
2. Confirm the diagnosis with definitive imaging if needed — contrast-enhanced CT venography or MR venography (or repeat/advanced Doppler) to define the extent of the clot.
3. Monitor for complications: check serum creatinine/urine output (AKI can occur), and assess for pulmonary embolus if shortness of breath or chest pain.

Important further work-up (to find the cause and guide duration of treatment)
- Quantify proteinuria (spot urine protein:creatinine ratio or 24-h urine) and measure serum albumin and lipids (to confirm nephrotic syndrome).
- Routine labs: CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, LFTs, coagulation tests.
- Tests for underlying causes:
  - Nephrotic syndrome work-up: anti-PLA2R (for membranous nephropathy), complement levels, consider kidney biopsy if diagnosis/treatment depends on it.
  - Infection/malignancy screen given your IV drug history: hepatitis B and C, HIV; age-appropriate cancer screening as indicated.
  - Thrombophilia tests (antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C/S, antithrombin, factor V Leiden / prothrombin mutation) — often deferred until after acute treatment but important if no clear cause.
- Nephrology and vascular/interventional radiology consultation for management and to consider thrombolysis/thrombectomy in selected severe cases (rapidly worsening renal function or extensive clot).

Typical treatment duration
- At least 3–6 months of anticoagulation for a first provoked RVT; longer or indefinite anticoagulation if ongoing nephrotic syndrome or an uncorrected hypercoagulable disorder.

Bottom line: This is likely renal vein thrombosis secondary to nephrotic-range protein loss. It is a potentially serious but treatable condition — anticoagulation and prompt nephrology follow-up and investigation for the cause are the priorities.

Choriocarcinoma D. Partial molar pregnancy E. Placental abruption,D,Partial molar pregnancy,neutral,"The ultrasound picture you describe (large placenta with multiple cystic spaces — “grape‑like” or “snowstorm” appearance — plus amorphous fetal parts) is most suggestive of a molar pregnancy (a hydatidiform mole). Because fetal tissue is reported, this more likely represents a partial molar pregnancy (partial moles often have some abnormal fetal tissue; complete moles usually have no fetal parts).

What this means and next steps
- Confirm diagnosis with a quantitative serum β‑hCG (levels are usually markedly elevated with complete moles; partial moles tend to have lower elevations).  
- Definitive treatment is uterine evacuation (suction dilation and curettage) with the products of conception sent for histopathology and, if available, cytogenetic testing.  
- If you are Rh‑negative you should receive anti‑D immunoglobulin.  
- Baseline evaluation for metastatic disease (typically a chest x‑ray) and routine pre‑procedure labs as indicated.  
- Follow‑up: serial quantitative β‑hCG monitoring until levels are undetectable (usually weekly until 3 consecutive negatives, then monthly as advised) to exclude persistent gestational trophoblastic disease. Contraception is recommended during the follow‑up period (commonly for 6 months after β‑hCG becomes negative) so new pregnancy does not confound monitoring.  
- Most women recover fully and can have normal pregnancies afterward; persistent GTN is more common after complete moles (higher risk) than after partial moles (lower risk), but follow‑up is essential.

I am currently taking hydroxyurea and folic acid as part of my treatment for sickle cell disease. The medical team performed several laboratory studies, which revealed a hemoglobin level of 6.4 g/dL. They also checked my leukocyte count, platelet count, mean corpuscular volume, and reticulocyte count. Given my symptoms and these findings, the doctors discussed potential underlying causes related to my condition.",A. Parvovirus B19 B. Medication-induced hemolysis C. Defect in erythrocyte membrane proteins D. Splenic vaso-occlusion E. Hemolytic crisis,A,Parvovirus B19,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: transient aplastic (pure red‑cell) crisis from parvovirus B19 infection.

Why: kids/teens with sickle cell have very high baseline RBC turnover and depend on constant marrow production. Parvovirus B19 infects erythroid precursors and briefly stops RBC production. That causes a rapid fall in hemoglobin with little or no reticulocyte response, acute fatigue, tachycardia, pallor, and a flow/midsystolic murmur from anemia. Fever fits with viral infection. By contrast, splenic sequestration would usually show an acutely enlarged spleen and often a brisk reticulocyte response; hydroxyurea can cause marrow suppression but would more typically produce broader cytopenias and a different time course.

Key lab expectations: very low hemoglobin (you have 6.4 g/dL) with a markedly low reticulocyte count, while WBCs and platelets are usually normal. Parvovirus testing (IgM or PCR) can confirm the cause.

Immediate management: supportive care and RBC transfusion if symptomatic or hemodynamically unstable; monitor vitals and hemoglobin, give pain/fever control and IV fluids as needed. If parvovirus is confirmed in severely immunocompromised patients, IVIG can be considered. Follow up with your hematology team for monitoring and immunologic testing.",Defect in erythrocyte membrane proteins,True,True,True,True,True
84,"I am a 23-year-old woman who recently went to the emergency department due to severe abdominal pain. Initially, the pain was dull and gradually became worse, but it intensified suddenly while I was exercising. My medical history includes depression, anxiety, and a previous case of gonococcal urethritis, which was treated appropriately. I am sexually active and do not use condoms. Additionally, I consume at least five standard alcoholic drinks daily. Recently, I lost a significant amount of weight in preparation for a fitness show I planned to enter.

Currently, I take several medications, including oral contraceptives, fluoxetine, alprazolam, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and folate. During the physical examination, I was noted to have an athletic build, with broad shoulders and a thick neck, along with acne on my forehead and back. The abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness, with the pain in my right upper quadrant rated at 10 out of 10. My vital signs showed low blood pressure at 80/40 mmHg, a pulse of 110 beats per minute, a temperature of 99.5°F, and normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation.

Intravenous fluids were initiated, and laboratory tests were ordered, including a urinary ß-hCG. I await further evaluation to determine the cause of my symptoms.",A. Obstruction of the common bile duct by radio-opaque stones B. Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein C. Vascular ectasia within the liver D. Ectopic implantation of a blastocyst E. Inflammation of the pancreas,C,Vascular ectasia within the liver,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: ruptured hepatic adenoma with intraperitoneal hemorrhage.

Why I think this
- Classic setting: young woman on combined oral contraceptives (and very possibly using anabolic steroids for bodybuilding given the broad shoulders/thick neck and acne). Both OCPs and androgens increase risk of hepatic adenomas.
- Typical presentation: gradually worsening abdominal pain with sudden severe worsening during exertion, severe right‑upper‑quadrant pain, hypotension (80/40) and tachycardia — all consistent with acute intra‑abdominal hemorrhage from a ruptured liver lesion.
- Your ED team appropriately ordered a urinary β‑hCG because ruptured ectopic is an important alternative to exclude.

Immediate priorities / recommended next steps (what to tell the ED team or expect)
1. Resuscitate and stabilize
   - Continue IV fluids, establish large‑bore IV access, type & cross and prepare blood products (transfusion likely needed).
2. Rapid bedside imaging
   - Perform a FAST (bedside ultrasound) to look for free intraperitoneal fluid. If unstable with positive FAST → urgent operative management.
   - If improving/stable, obtain contrast CT abdomen/pelvis to identify a ruptured hepatic lesion (adenoma) vs other bleeding source.
3. Consults
   - Immediate surgical and interventional radiology consults. Management options include urgent laparotomy for hemorrhage control or transarterial embolization depending on stability and resources.
4. Labs
   - CBC, coagulation panel, LFTs, type & cross, lactate, and the pregnancy test (already ordered) — a positive β‑hCG shifts concern to ruptured ectopic and pelvic ultrasound will be needed.
5. Medication/other measures
   - Stop OCPs and any exogenous androgens/steroids (if you are using them).
   - Pain control and monitoring in a monitored setting (ICU if unstable).

Other important differentials (less likely given hypotension and RUQ predominance)
- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy (important to exclude — hence β‑hCG).
- Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (usually lower quadrant).
- Fitz‑Hugh‑Curtis (perihepatic pain from PID) — usually not hemorrhagic or hypotensive.
- Splenic rupture (would give LUQ pain more typically).

What you should know and expect
- This is potentially life‑threatening and requires urgent evaluation and often intervention. If the FAST is positive and you remain hypotensive, expect urgent surgery or embolization. If stable, CT will usually make the diagnosis and IR embolization may control bleeding.

If you want, tell me what imaging/labs they report next (FAST/CT, β‑hCG, CBC) and I can help interpret results and the likely management path.",Vascular ectasia within the liver,False,False,False,False,False
85,"I am a 25-year-old man who visited the emergency department due to back pain that began yesterday. The discomfort has progressively worsened over time. I noticed that moving or lifting aggravates the pain, while resting and taking ibuprofen seem to provide some relief. 

I have a history of smoking and IV drug use, with my last use occurring two days ago. I suspect that my back pain may be connected to lifting a heavy box. During my visit, my temperature was measured at 99.3°F, and my blood pressure was recorded at 122/88 mmHg. My pulse was 77 beats per minute, and my respirations were at 14 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.

The physical examination revealed focal pain on the left side of my back, lateral to my spine, though there was no tenderness in the midline. Other aspects of the examination did not show any significant findings. I also have noticeable scars in the antecubital fossae on both arms. 

Overall, my symptoms and medical history were taken into account during the assessment.",A. Compression fracture B. Epidural abscess C. Epidural hematoma D. Herniated nucleus pulposus E. Muscle strain,E,Muscle strain,neutral,"Thanks — that’s helpful detail. Short answer: your history and exam are most consistent with acute mechanical back strain from lifting, but your recent IV drug use is an important red flag for spinal infection (epidural abscess, vertebral osteomyelitis) or other deep infection, so you should get a focused workup rather than assume simple strain.

What is reassuring
- Onset associated with lifting, pain worsened by movement and improved by rest/ibuprofen (typical for mechanical strain).
- Vitals essentially normal (only low‑grade temp 99.3°F).
- No midline spinal tenderness or neurologic findings reported.

Why I’m concerned
- Recent IV drug use (2 days ago) substantially increases risk of bacteremia and spinal/soft‑tissue infection even if fever is minimal.
- Injection scars suggest ongoing risk exposure.

Recommended next steps now
1. In the ED or urgent clinic: get labs — CBC, blood cultures (before any antibiotics if possible), ESR and CRP. Elevated ESR/CRP support possible infection.
2. If ESR/CRP are elevated, blood cultures positive, persistent/worsening pain, fever, or any neurologic deficits → urgent MRI of the spine with contrast (best test for epidural abscess/osteomyelitis). If MRI unavailable, CT can be a stopgap but is less sensitive.
3. If labs are normal, pain is improving with conservative care and you have no neurologic symptoms, outpatient management may be reasonable: NSAIDs, relative rest, avoid heavy lifting, return precautions, and close follow‑up within 48–72 hours with repeat assessment/labs if symptoms persist/worsen.

Red flags that require immediate return to ED
- New or worsening leg weakness, numbness, or tingling
- Saddle anesthesia or new bowel/bladder dysfunction (incontinence or urinary retention)
- High fever or rigors, increasing severe pain, or inability to ambulate
- Rapid clinical worsening

Other considerations
- Because of IV drug use, consider screening for HIV and hepatitis C and linkage to substance‑use treatment/harm‑reduction services.
- If infection is confirmed or highly suspected, hospitalization and IV antibiotics (and possibly surgery) may be needed.

86,"I am a 25-year-old woman who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after experiencing hematemesis and shock. Five days prior, I had developed a high fever that reached 40.0℃ (104.0℉), accompanied by retro-orbital pain, nausea, and muscle aches. While the fever subsided over a few days, I started to experience severe abdominal pain and noticed bleeding from my gums. I had one episode of vomiting blood before my admission to the ICU.

I frequently travel to Latin America during the winter, and two weeks ago, I spent time in Brazil, mostly outdoors. Upon arriving at the ICU, I was feeling restless. My temperature was recorded at 38.0℃ (100.4℉), with a pulse of 110 beats per minute, a respiration rate of 33 breaths per minute, and my blood pressure measured at 90/70 mm Hg. The medical staff noted conjunctival suffusion, cold extremities, and a maculopapular rash on my trunk and limbs. There were also ecchymoses present on my lower extremities. A physical examination revealed dullness at the lung bases, and my abdomen was distended, with the liver edge palpable.

This series of symptoms and clinical findings led to my admission to the ICU for further evaluation and management.",A. Chikungunya virus infection B. Dengue fever C. Chagas disease D. Yellow fever E. Zika virus infection,B,Dengue fever,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Severe dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome) due to dengue virus (Aedes-transmitted flavivirus). The classic pattern — high fever then defervescence followed by plasma leakage, severe abdominal pain, mucosal bleeding, thrombocytopenia/hemorrhage, pleural effusions/ascites and circulatory collapse — fits your history and exam. Travel to Brazil and the maculopapular rash and retro‑orbital pain further support this.

Key immediate management priorities (ICU)
- Hemodynamic resuscitation: give isotonic crystalloid boluses (e.g., 10–20 mL/kg over 15–30 min; many protocols use 20 mL/kg) and reassess frequently. Repeat boluses as needed. If shock persists despite crystalloids, use colloid or vasoactive support per ICU protocols.
- Close monitoring: continuous vital signs, hourly urine output (target >0.5 mL/kg/h), frequent assessment of mental status, and serial hematocrits to assess plasma leakage.
- Blood products for bleeding: transfuse packed RBCs for ongoing significant hemorrhage or hemodynamic instability. Platelet transfusion is NOT routinely indicated for low platelets alone — give platelets and/or FFP for life‑threatening bleeding or before invasive procedures. Correct coagulopathy as needed.
- Respiratory support: oxygen; intubate if respiratory failure or severe pulmonary edema.
- Symptomatic care: acetaminophen for pain/fever. Strictly avoid NSAIDs/aspirin (increase bleeding risk).
- Labs and imaging: CBC (serial platelets, hematocrit), electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, coagulation panel, crossmatch; chest x‑ray or bedside ultrasound for pleural effusions/ascites.
- Specific testing: dengue NS1 antigen/PCR early, IgM/IgG serology later. Also consider testing for leptospirosis, malaria, and other tropical infections if clinically indicated (conjunctival suffusion can suggest leptospirosis).

Prognosis and counseling
- With prompt, careful fluid management and supportive ICU care many patients recover. Delayed or inadequate fluid resuscitation during the critical plasma‑leak phase increases risk of death.

87,"I am a 16-year-old who had an impacted tooth removed recently. After the procedure, I experienced persistent bleeding from my gums. Despite having multiple gauze packs applied, the bleeding continued with minimal effect. I have a history of easy bruising, which has been a concern for me. 

In my family, my medical history is mostly unremarkable, but I do have a maternal uncle who also had issues with easy bruising and joint swelling. I was taken to the emergency department due to my ongoing bleeding. 

The medical team assessed my condition, noting my symptoms and history. They conducted several evaluations to understand the situation better. Throughout this experience, the focus has been on addressing the bleeding and identifying any underlying issues that might be contributing to my tendency to bruise easily.",A. Von Willebrand disease B. Glanzmann thrombasthenia C. Hemophilia D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation E. Immune thrombocytopenia F. Bernard-Soulier syndrome,C,Hemophilia,neutral,"Thanks — that history (prolonged bleeding after a tooth extraction, lifelong easy bruising, and a maternal uncle with easy bruising plus joint swelling) raises concern for an inherited bleeding disorder and needs targeted evaluation and prompt local control of bleeding.

Immediate advice (if you are still bleeding or worried now)
- If bleeding is ongoing, go back to the ED or your dentist now. Ongoing oral bleeding that won’t stop, large hematoma, dropping energy/lightheadedness, or difficulty breathing/swallowing are urgent.
- While getting there: sit upright, bite firmly on sterile gauze or a tea bag over the socket for 20–30 minutes without loosening, avoid spitting, and don’t take aspirin/ibuprofen. Acetaminophen is OK for pain.
- Ask about tranexamic acid (TXA) mouthwash (5% TXA rinse or crushed tablet dissolved and gently held on the site) or systemic TXA — these are commonly used to stop oral bleeding and are safe in many cases but should be given under medical supervision.

Most likely causes to consider (given your history)
- Hemophilia A or B (X‑linked): maternal uncle with bruising and joint swelling (hemarthroses) is very suggestive. If you are male, this is important to consider.
- von Willebrand disease (vWD): common inherited bleeding disorder that causes mucosal bleeding and easy bruising; can present in males or females.
- Platelet disorders (low count or dysfunction) or medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, some supplements).
- Less likely but possible: connective-tissue disorders (some Ehlers–Danlos types), liver disease, or acquired causes (immune thrombocytopenia, etc.).

Recommended initial tests (ask ED/your doctor for these)
- CBC with platelet count and hemoglobin/hematocrit.
- PT/INR and aPTT.
- Fibrinogen.
- Type and screen if bleeding is significant.
If initial tests are normal but bleeding/clues persist, specialized tests:
- von Willebrand studies: vWF antigen, vWF activity (ristocetin cofactor or equivalent), and factor VIII level.
- Factor VIII and IX activity levels (to evaluate hemophilia A/B).
- Platelet function testing (PFA-100/closure time or formal platelet function assays) if platelet dysfunction suspected.
- Referral to a hematologist for further workup and genetic testing if an inherited disorder is suspected.

Practical next steps
1. Tell the ED/dentist about your family history (maternal uncle with joint swelling) and easy bruising — that changes the evaluation.
2. Ensure you get the basic labs above; if someone already ran labs, share the results here or with your clinician.
3. If an inherited disorder is diagnosed, get a hematology referral and discuss dental/surgical precautions (factor replacement or desmopressin for some conditions, tranexamic acid, local hemostatic measures).
4. Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs and certain supplements (fish oil, high-dose vitamin E) until cleared.

88,"I arrived at the emergency department experiencing severe pain in my head, which had started about an hour after rugby practice.

A head CT scan was ordered to investigate my symptoms further.",A. Hemorrhagic stroke B. Ischemic stroke secondary to a thrombus C. Medication reaction D. Psychogenic symptoms E. Subarachnoid hemorrhage,C,Medication reaction,neutral,"Most likely you are having an acute ischemic stroke caused by medication-induced cerebral vasospasm. Explanation and key points:

- Why this fits: you developed new focal neurologic deficits (slurred speech, facial droop, 2/5 arm strength) after receiving dihydroergotamine. Ergot alkaloids (dihydroergotamine) and triptans (sumatriptan) both cause cerebral vasoconstriction. Using an ergot derivative within 24 hours of a triptan is contraindicated because of a high risk of severe vasospasm and ischemia. Your exam is focal (not the generalized autonomic/hyperreflexic picture of serotonin syndrome), so a vasospasm/ischemic stroke is most likely.

- What should be done now (urgent actions ED/stroke team typically takes):
  - Immediately stop any vasoconstrictive agents (no more dihydroergotamine or triptans).
  - Noncontrast head CT (to exclude hemorrhage) — already ordered; proceed urgently.
  - Vascular imaging (CT angiography or MR angiography) to look for large-vessel vasospasm/occlusion.
  - Urgent neurology/stroke consult. If ischemic stroke is confirmed and you are within the thrombolysis window, the stroke team will weigh IV tPA or endovascular therapy — but they must know about the recent ergot/triptan exposure because management may differ and may prompt consideration of intra-arterial vasodilator therapy for drug-induced vasospasm (eg, intra-arterial verapamil or other vasodilators) or other interventions.
  - Admit to a stroke unit/ICU for monitoring, supportive care, and blood pressure/oxygen management.

89,"I am a 27-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department by ambulance after an incident at a welfare appointment.

However, I struggled to answer questions and had difficulty remembering the episode.",A. Absence seizure B. Complex partial seizure C. Generalized seizure D. Malingering E. Transient ischemic attack,B,Complex partial seizure,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- A focal (partial) seizure with impaired awareness — classically a temporal‑lobe “complex partial” seizure. The key features are the sudden staring, motor automatisms (lip‑smacking), transient unresponsiveness, and the confused/postictal state with amnesia for the event.

Why this fits and why other causes are less likely
- Fits: abrupt behavioral change → staring + automatisms → brief postictal confusion/amnesia = focal seizure.
- Absence seizures are brief (seconds), occur in children/young adolescents, and lack a prolonged postictal state.
- Generalized tonic‑clonic seizures have convulsions and a more pronounced postictal period.
- TIA/stroke usually produces focal deficits rather than automatisms and postictal confusion of this type.
- Psychogenic non‑epileptic events can mimic seizures but commonly have different features (longer, variable movements, less stereotypy, rarely a true postictal amnesia).

Immediate ED/acute steps you can expect
1. Stabilize ABCs; check bedside glucose immediately (hypoglycemia can mimic seizures).  
2. Benzodiazepine (eg, lorazepam IV) only if seizure is ongoing; otherwise observe.  
3. Labs: serum glucose, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, CBC, renal/hepatic function, blood alcohol level, urine toxicology. Consider testing for withdrawal (alcohol/benzo).  
4. Noncontrast head CT in the ED if focal deficits, recent head trauma, altered mental status, or to exclude an acute bleed. MRI brain is the best test later to look for structural lesions (especially temporal lobe).  
5. EEG (ideally video EEG) as soon as practical to look for epileptiform discharges and help determine seizure focus.  
6. Admit or observe until you regain baseline mental status and initial workup is done.

Treatment and follow‑up
- If this is a first unprovoked seizure and imaging/EEG are normal, many neurologists do not start daily anti‑seizure medication immediately; treatment is considered if there is a high recurrence risk (abnormal MRI with a lesion, epileptiform EEG, status epilepticus, remote symptomatic cause).  
- If treatment is indicated or seizures recur, levetiracetam is commonly used initially due to ease of dosing and tolerability. Your neurologist will choose the best agent for you.  
- Arrange neurology follow‑up (ideally within days to a couple of weeks) for EEG/MRI review and treatment decisions.

Practical advice and safety
- Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or take safety‑sensitive jobs until cleared by neurology and local driving laws are satisfied (restrictions vary; often several months seizure‑free).  
- Avoid alcohol and illicit drugs and get evaluated/treated for substance‑use disorder if needed — alcohol/benzo withdrawal commonly precipitate seizures.  
- Keep a record of the event and any triggers.

Return to ED immediately if
- You have another seizure, prolonged seizure (>5 minutes), difficulty breathing, persistent confusion/weakness or new focal neurological deficits, head trauma, or fever.

Mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction D. Transmural distal esophagus tear E. Transmural erosion of the gastric wall,C,Mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction,neutral,"Vomiting frank blood (hematemesis) in someone with heavy alcohol use is an emergency. The most likely causes here, and what clinicians would do next, are:

Most likely diagnoses (ranked)
- Mallory–Weiss tear — a mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction from forceful retching; very common after heavy vomiting and alcohol. Often bright red blood and can be brisk.
- Peptic ulcer or erosive gastritis — NSAID use (ibuprofen/ketorolac) and alcohol increase risk of gastric/duodenal ulcers and gastritis that can bleed.
- Esophageal variceal bleeding — common in chronic alcoholics with underlying liver disease/portal hypertension; can cause large-volume hematemesis.
- Less likely: Boerhaave syndrome (full‑thickness esophageal rupture) — typically severe chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema, systemic toxicity; needs CT/esophagram to diagnose.

Key immediate actions (what emergency staff should/likely did)
- Airway protection: consider rapid-sequence intubation if ongoing vomiting/hematemesis, altered mental status, or aspiration risk (this is common with intoxication).
- Resuscitation: large-bore IV access, IV crystalloids, monitor vitals, oxygen, place on cardiac/SpO2 monitor.
- Labs and blood: CBC (serial Hgb/Hct), BMP, LFTs, coagulation studies (PT/INR), type & crossmatch for blood, alcohol level, and toxicology as indicated.
- Pharmacologic temporizing therapy:
  - IV proton pump inhibitor (e.g., pantoprazole) if upper GI bleed suspected.
  - If variceal bleed suspected (history of chronic alcohol use, stigmata of liver disease): start octreotide infusion and give IV antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone) while arranging urgent endoscopy.
- Urgent GI consultation for endoscopy (diagnostic + therapeutic; banding for varices, clips/epinephrine/thermal therapy for ulcers/tears).
- Correct coagulopathy and transfuse PRBCs if hemoglobin low or hemodynamic instability; transfusion threshold commonly Hgb <7 g/dL (higher target for ongoing massive bleed).
- Imaging if concern for Boerhaave (severe chest pain, crepitus): contrast CT chest or water‑soluble contrast esophagram.

What this likely means for you
- Mallory–Weiss and many NSAID-related bleeds are often self-limited but may need endoscopic therapy if bleeding persists.
- Variceal bleeding is high-risk and requires specific therapy (octreotide, antibiotics, urgent band ligation).
- Because you were intoxicated and combative, airway protection (intubation) is frequently needed to prevent aspiration when hematemesis occurs.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome,D,Rubeola,neutral,"The way you describe him (high fever, very fast heart rate, looking “very ill,” becoming confused, and a rash that spread quickly) is red-flag territory. The single most urgent possibility that fits these signs is a fulminant bacterial infection such as meningococcemia/meningitis or another form of sepsis. These illnesses can cause fever, a rapidly spreading rash, altered mental status, very fast heart rate, and can get worse quickly. Other possibilities include severe viral infections (measles, varicella with encephalitis) or tick‑borne illness (e.g., RMSF), but bacterial sepsis/meningitis is the immediate concern because it can be life‑threatening and needs immediate treatment.

What the ED team should do right away
- Treat this as an emergency: hospitalize, start IV fluids and monitoring (cardiac, blood pressure, urine output).  
- Obtain urgent blood tests (CBC, blood cultures, electrolytes, coagulation studies) and start empiric IV antibiotics immediately (do not wait for culture results) if bacterial sepsis/meningitis is suspected. Typical empiric regimens for a child this age include ceftriaxone plus vancomycin (the exact choice is decided by the treating physicians).  
- Perform a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to check for meningitis if it is safe to do so; if there are signs of increased intracranial pressure or hemodynamic instability, a CT scan may be done first.  
- Place appropriate isolation precautions (droplet precautions for suspected meningococcus or measles, airborne for measles).  
- If meningococcal disease is confirmed or strongly suspected, close contacts will need urgent prophylactic antibiotics and public health notification.

Questions you should tell the doctors (or expect them to ask)
- What does the rash look like? Are the spots tiny and non‑blanching/petechial or purplish (raises concern for meningococcemia) or are they blistery (varicella) or a flat red rash that started on the head and spread (measles/RMSF patterns differ)?  
- Has he had any neck stiffness, severe headache, vomiting, seizures, or difficulty waking up?  
- Any recent tick bites or known exposures? Any cough, runny nose, or sore eyes?  
- What is his vaccination history (especially MMR, varicella, Hib, pneumococcal, meningococcal)?

What you should do now
- Stay in the ED and insist on prompt evaluation and treatment — this is potentially life‑threatening and should not wait.  
- Tell staff about his vaccination history and the recent outdoor exposures.

93,"I am a 45-year-old man who experienced a traumatic event where I was stabbed 12 times in different areas of my body. When paramedics arrived, they noted that I had lost a significant amount of blood at the scene. My condition was critical, scoring 3 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, so they secured an endotracheal airway and established large-bore access before transporting me to the emergency department.

Upon arrival, the medical team began aggressive resuscitation using a massive transfusion protocol while preparing for an exploratory laparotomy. They inserted an arterial line and secured central access. At that time, my temperature was recorded at 95°F, my blood pressure was critically low at 50/40 mmHg, and my pulse was 80 beats per minute, with controlled respirations at 20 breaths per minute on lung-protective ventilation.

Despite receiving a transfusion of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets in a 6:6:1 ratio, along with a continuous phenylephrine infusion, my vital signs remained unchanged. The surgical team indicated that there was no active bleeding detected. A stat ScvO2 result showed 39%, although my oxygen saturation was at 100% while on supplemental oxygen. My extremities felt cold, even after the room temperature was increased to 80°F.",A. Cardiac tamponade B. Cervical spinal cord transection C. Occult hemorrhage D. Pulmonary embolism E. Undiagnosed pneumonia,A,Cardiac tamponade,neutral,"You are in a low‑cardiac‑output (flow) shock state rather than a low‑oxygenation problem. Key clues: SaO2 100% but very low ScvO2 (39%) means arterial blood is well oxygenated but tissues are extracting almost all O2 because delivery (cardiac output) is inadequate. Cold, pale extremities and profound hypotension despite pressors and no ongoing hemorrhage point to cardiogenic/obstructive shock — in a stabbed patient the top immediate concern is cardiac tamponade (or other obstructive causes such as tension pneumothorax or massive mechanical obstruction).

Immediate priorities (in order):
1. Rapid bedside echo (transthoracic or TEE/FAST cardiac view) to look for pericardial effusion/tamponade and assess cardiac contractility. This is the single most useful test now.
2. If tamponade is identified and the patient is unstable: emergent pericardiotomy/pericardial decompression (pericardiocentesis if temporizing but definitive management is surgical — emergency thoracotomy/median sternotomy depending on setting and local trauma algorithms).
3. If echo is negative for tamponade, rapidly exclude tension pneumothorax (exam, bedside ultrasound/chest x‑ray if possible) and place chest tube/needle decompression if suspected.
4. Stop/avoid pure alpha agonists (phenylephrine) if cardiac output is very low; they increase afterload and can worsen CO. Instead use agents to support perfusion and increase CO: norepinephrine (vasopressor with some beta activity) and add an inotrope (dobutamine or epinephrine) if contractility is poor.
5. Continue active warming, correct hypothermia, acidemia, hypocalcemia and coagulopathy (these all impair myocardial performance and hemostasis). Check hemoglobin, lactate, ABG, ionized calcium, and repeat FAST/CT as appropriate.
6. If no reversible obstructive/cardiogenic cause is found and bleeding is still suspected, consider REBOA or return to the OR for definitive control per trauma protocols.

Why phenylephrine was ineffective: it raises SVR but does not improve—and may reduce—cardiac output. Low ScvO2 with high SaO2 is classic for low flow state; the correct immediate action is to restore forward flow (relieve tamponade/obstruction, improve contractility/CO) rather than pure vasoconstriction.

When we arrived, the medical staff examined him. I noticed that he was holding his right arm close to his body, and it was flexed and pronated. He didn’t want to move it at all, which was unusual for him. I was worried about what might be wrong and hoped the doctors could help him feel better.",A. Proximal ulnar fracture B. Anterior shoulder dislocation C. Supracondylar fracture of the humerus D. Olecranon fracture E. Radial head subluxation,E,Radial head subluxation,neutral,"This presentation is very typical of ""nursemaid’s elbow"" (radial head subluxation).

Why: in toddlers (commonly 1–4 years) a sudden longitudinal pull on the forearm can let the annular ligament slip off the radial head. It causes acute pain and the child will hold the arm slightly flexed and pronated and refuse to use it. Onset 10–60 minutes after being lifted by the arms is classic.

What is done: a trained clinician can usually reduce it quickly in the ED with a simple maneuver (either supination of the forearm with elbow flexion, or a hyperpronation technique). You’ll often hear or feel a small click and the child is typically relieved and will start using the arm within minutes.

When to worry / need X‑rays or further evaluation:
- If there is visible deformity, swelling, bruising, or focal bone tenderness (suggests fracture)
- If numbness, poor circulation, or persistent severe pain occurs
- If reduction doesn’t relieve the pain or the arm is still not used after a short time
- If the mechanism was a high‑energy injury or you’re unsure what happened

Prevention: avoid lifting or swinging a toddler by the wrists or hands; pick them up under the arms or around the torso. Some children get recurrent episodes; tell your caregivers what to do to avoid pulling.

Upon arrival, my vital signs showed a temperature of 99°F, blood pressure of 129/66 mmHg, a pulse of 127 beats per minute, and respirations at 16 breaths per minute. My oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. The medical team performed a primary and secondary survey, noting bruising along my chest wall on both sides. Initial imaging, including a pelvic radiograph and an electrocardiogram (ECG), did not show any abnormalities. However, a chest radiograph revealed a sternal fracture and several rib fractures. 

I was administered morphine for pain relief, which caused my heart rate to improve to 80 beats per minute. I remained under observation in the emergency department for the next six hours, during which my laboratory values and a repeat ECG returned to normal limits.

- Perform bedside chest ultrasound (eFAST/POCUS) right away — much more sensitive than supine CXR for pneumothorax.
- If ultrasound/CXR/CT confirms a pneumothorax and you are symptomatic/tachycardic/hypoxic: place a chest tube (tube thoracostomy). If you develop signs of tension physiology (hypotension, severe distention, tracheal deviation), perform immediate needle decompression followed by chest tube.
- If imaging instead shows a hemothorax or large pulmonary contusion, manage with chest tube for hemothorax; supportive care (oxygen, analgesia, aggressive pulmonary toilet, consider ICU/ventilatory support) for contusion.
- If imaging is inconclusive and clinical suspicion remains high, get an urgent chest CT.

When I arrived at the emergency department, my blood pressure was measured at 110/74 mm Hg, my heart rate was 94 beats per minute, and my respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. The medical staff conducted a physical examination and found that my lips were swollen, and I had a stridor during inhalation, indicating a problem with my airway.

The healthcare team considered various potential diagnoses based on my symptoms and history. I was informed that my C1 esterase inhibitor levels were normal, which was part of the assessment process. I was concerned about my condition and hoped for a prompt resolution to my breathing difficulties.",A. Scleredema B. Erysipelas C. Facial lymphedema D. Drug-induced angioedema E. Contact dermatitis,D,Drug-induced angioedema,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: ACE‑inhibitor–induced angioedema (bradykinin‑mediated). The timing after starting lisinopril, painless non‑pruritic lip/face swelling with laryngeal involvement (stridor), normal C1‑esterase inhibitor levels, and absence of urticaria or shock all point to this rather than allergic/anaphylactic or hereditary angioedema.

Immediate priorities
- Airway first: stridor = threatened airway. Early involvement of anesthesia/ENT and planning for controlled airway protection (awake fiber‑optic intubation or, if necessary, surgical airway) is essential. Don’t wait for complete obstruction.  
- Stop lisinopril immediately and document it as an allergy.

Specific medical treatments
- Antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine are often ineffective because this is bradykinin‑mediated, but they are sometimes given while definitive therapy is arranged.  
- If available, give bradykinin‑targeted therapy: icatibant (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist) is commonly used; ecallantide (kallikrein inhibitor) or C1‑esterase inhibitor concentrate can also help.  
- If those are not available and airway is threatened, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is sometimes used as rescue therapy because it contains kininases that degrade bradykinin.  
- Admit for monitored observation until edema has clearly resolved.

Prognosis and follow‑up
- Symptoms often resolve over 24–72 hours (faster with targeted therapy), but the episode can be life‑threatening while edema persists.  
- Never restart an ACE inhibitor. Consider alternative antihypertensive classes (CCB, thiazide, beta‑blocker); ARBs carry a small risk of recurrence and should be used only with caution and informed discussion.  
- Ensure allergy is documented and educate you to seek urgent care for recurrent swelling or breathing difficulty.

Wellens syndrome,A,Brugada syndrome,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: transient choke/strangulation-induced syncope due to acute cerebral hypoperfusion (mechanical compression of the carotid arteries and/or carotid sinus reflex; sometimes called chokehold or asphyxial syncope). 

Why this fits:
- Timing: it occurred during a grappling choke.
- Symptoms: brief loss of consciousness (~10 seconds) with rapid, complete recovery and no persistent confusion—typical for syncope from sudden reduction in cerebral blood flow.
- ED data: normal pulse/oxygenation and normal basic labs/ECG make primary cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, seizure, or ongoing hypoxia less likely.

Mechanisms (brief):
- Direct compression of the carotid arteries reduces blood flow to the brain.
- Compression of the carotid sinus can trigger a vagal reflex causing bradycardia and hypotension.
- If the airway was obstructed, hypoxia can cause rapid loss of consciousness (asphyxial syncope).

Immediate management and follow-up:
- If your neurologic exam is normal, vitals stable, and troponin/ECG remain normal, no acute invasive testing is usually required.
- You should be observed until fully back to baseline and then avoid further choking/sparring until cleared.
- Seek urgent care if you develop recurrent fainting, focal neurologic deficits (weakness, slurred speech, vision changes), severe headache, neck pain, persistent confusion, or seizure-like activity.
- Consider follow-up with your primary care physician or sports medicine doctor. They may recommend further testing only if recurrent or concerning features occur (carotid/neck imaging, cardiac evaluation [Holter/event monitor], tilt-table testing, or neurology referral).

Practical advice:
- Do not return to competition or driving until a clinician clears you (local rules vary; many sports/medical providers recommend not returning the same day after a loss of consciousness).

Missed abortion,C,Threatened abortion,neutral,"You did the right things by getting checked. Here’s what your findings most likely mean, what to watch for, and what to do next.

What your exam means
- A viable fetus with a normal fetal heart rate and a closed cervical os are both reassuring signs — they make an immediate miscarriage less likely.  
- Vaginal bleeding in the first half of pregnancy is common (occurs in a significant minority of pregnancies) and has many causes. The most common causes at 15 weeks are a small subchorionic hematoma (a localized bleed between the placenta and the uterus), cervical irritation (polyps, infection), or less commonly placental problems.  
- “Threatened miscarriage” is the term often used when there is bleeding but the cervix is closed and the fetus is alive. Many such pregnancies go on normally.

What’s helpful now
- Follow your doctor’s advice to rest and avoid sexual activity (pelvic rest) until the bleeding resolves or your clinician clears you. Although strict bed rest hasn’t been proven to prevent miscarriage, avoiding strenuous activity and sexual intercourse is commonly recommended while bleeding persists.  
- Use acetaminophen (paracetamol) for pain if needed. Avoid NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) unless your provider tells you otherwise.  
- If your blood type is Rh-negative and you’re bleeding, you may need anti‑D (Rho[D] immune globulin). If you don’t know your blood type, ask the clinic to check it.

When to seek emergency care (go to ED or call your provider now if any of these occur)
- Heavy bleeding (soaking a pad in an hour), large clots, or passage of tissue  
- Severe abdominal pain or cramping not controlled by acetaminophen  
- Dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, or a very fast/persistent heart rate  
- Fever ≥ 38°C (100.4°F) or foul-smelling vaginal discharge

About your heart rate of 120 bpm
- A heart rate of 120 can be due to anxiety, pain, dehydration, or physiological changes in pregnancy. If it was transient and you feel fine now, it’s likely not dangerous, but persistent palpitations, chest pain, lightheadedness, or fainting should be evaluated.

Follow-up
- Your clinician may repeat an ultrasound in 1–2 weeks or sooner if bleeding worsens. Quantitative β-hCG was taken; after a viable 15-week ultrasound a repeat hCG is often unnecessary, but your doctor will advise based on results.  
- Keep a record of bleeding (date, amount—pad saturation/time, clots) and any new symptoms, and report these at follow-up.

Pancreatitis,D,Pancreatic pseudocyst,neutral,"Thanks — this is a helpful history. I can’t make a definite diagnosis without the CT images/results and some labs, but based on your symptoms, exam and exposures the most likely causes and the next best steps are:

Most likely diagnoses to consider
- Peptic gastritis or peptic ulcer disease from heavy NSAID use (epigastric pain, early satiety, nausea/vomiting).  
- Acute pancreatitis from binge alcohol use (epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting); lipase would help confirm.  
- Acute viral hepatitis (exposure via shared drinks/paraphernalia, some others ill) — can present with nausea, vague abdominal/epigastric discomfort and early satiety.  
- Gastric outlet obstruction (complication of ulcers or severe gastritis) if vomiting/early satiety is prominent.  
- Less likely but important to keep in mind: mesenteric ischemia (with vasoconstrictive drugs like cocaine), biliary disease, or an infectious gastroenteritis depending on exposure and timeline.

Immediate tests I’d order now
- Serum lipase (for pancreatitis).  
- CBC, basic metabolic panel (BMP) / electrolytes, liver function tests (AST/ALT, bilirubin, alk phos).  
- Pregnancy test if applicable.  
- Urine drug screen and blood alcohol level (helps interpretation).  
- H. pylori testing (urea breath or stool antigen) or testing later if PUD/gastritis suspected.  
- Hepatitis serologies (A, B, C) if exposure is a concern, and consider vaccinating for Hep A/B if you are not immune.  
- If bleeding is suspected, type & cross or stool guaiac.  
- If CT was done for concern of pancreatitis/bowel issue, please share the radiology report or the images.

Initial management while diagnosing
- Stop NSAIDs and alcohol immediately.  
- NPO if pancreatitis or gastric outlet obstruction suspected; fluid resuscitation (IV crystalloids) and antiemetics; analgesia as needed.  
- If PUD/gastritis suspected, start a proton-pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole) unless instructed otherwise by ER/GI.  
- If imaging or labs confirm a serious condition (pancreatitis, perforated ulcer, obstruction), you may need admission, GI or surgical consult.

When to return to the ED urgently
- Worsening or severe abdominal pain, high fever, fainting, rapid heart rate or low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting with dehydration, blood in vomit or stool, or jaundice.

Rib fracture B. Traumatic aortic dissection C. Myocardial rupture D. Pulmonary contusion E. Diaphragmatic rupture,B,Traumatic aortic dissection,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: traumatic thoracic aortic injury (acute aortic transection/dissection), classically at the aortic isthmus from rapid deceleration.

Why this fits
- Mechanism: high‑speed motor vehicle crash → deceleration shear forces.
- Symptoms/signs: sudden ""tearing"" chest pain, hypotension, asymmetric upper‑extremity BPs and absent/diminished peripheral pulses (suggests disruption/occlusion of the aortic arch or proximal descending aorta).
- CXR: widened mediastinum is a classic radiographic clue for thoracic aortic injury.

Pathophysiology in one line: shear stress at the relatively fixed aortic isthmus (anchored by the ligamentum arteriosum) causes intimal tear, transection, or contained rupture that can obstruct distal flow and cause massive mediastinal hemorrhage.

Urgent steps (typical ED/trauma approach)
- Immediate resuscitation (airway/breathing), large‑bore IV access, balanced resuscitation.
- Tight hemodynamic control (reduce shear stress with beta‑blocker +/- vasodilator if time and patient tolerates).
- If hemodynamically stable: CT angiography of the chest to confirm and localize the injury.
- If unstable or confirmed major aortic injury: urgent surgical/endovascular repair (TEVAR preferred when available).

Other considerations (less likely given the findings): isolated myocardial contusion, tamponade, or great‑vessel injury—these are possibilities but the combination of deceleration, asymmetric arm BPs, absent leg pulses and widened mediastinum points strongly to aortic injury.",Rib fracture,True,True,False,True,True

Cystic teratoma D. Cysticercosis E. Hepatic hemangioma,B,Echinococcosis,neutral,"Thank you — that’s a good, clear history. Based on what you’ve described, here’s what is most likely, what else could cause a 6 x 4 cm cystic lesion in the right hepatic lobe, what tests are useful, and what next steps I would recommend.

Most likely possibilities
- Simple (congenital) hepatic cyst — the commonest cause. Usually benign, asymptomatic, and found incidentally on imaging.
- Hepatic cystic neoplasm (biliary cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma) — less common; more likely if the cyst has septations, nodules, or mural enhancement.
- Hydatid (Echinococcus) cyst — important to consider if you have relevant animal/zoonotic exposure (dogs, sheep, certain livestock environments). Horses are not a typical reservoir for human Echinococcus, but working on farms with dogs and livestock can increase risk.
- Pyogenic (bacterial) liver abscess or amebic liver abscess — usually cause fever, RUQ pain and greater leukocytosis; can be cystic on imaging.
- Cystic metastasis or cystic degeneration within a solid tumor — less likely but considered if there is a relevant cancer history.

What the imaging characteristics tell us (and what to look for)
- A true simple cyst on CT/US appears as a round/oval, thin-walled lesion with water-density contents, no internal septations or solid components, and no contrast enhancement. That supports observation.
- Complex features (thickened/irregular wall, septations, mural nodules, internal debris, calcification, or enhancement) raise concern for hydatid disease, abscess, or neoplasm and warrant further workup and often intervention.

What tests I’d recommend next
- Review the CT report and images closely (or bring the images to a hepatology or surgical consult). Note attenuation, wall thickness, septa, nodules, calcifications, and enhancement.
- Basic labs if not already done: liver function tests (AST/ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), CRP, repeat CBC.
- If infection is suspected (fever, rising WBC/CRP, RUQ pain): blood cultures and consider image-guided aspiration for culture.
- If exposure risk to Echinococcus: hydatid serology (ELISA/IgG) and discuss with infectious disease or hepatobiliary surgery before any percutaneous procedure.
- If imaging is suspicious for neoplasm: tumor markers can be considered (CA 19‑9, CEA, AFP) but they are not definitive; surgical consultation and possible resection or biopsy would be indicated.
- If imaging is indeterminate: contrast-enhanced MRI can better characterize cystic hepatic lesions.

Typical management options
- If the lesion is a simple cyst (imaging typical, asymptomatic, normal labs): no treatment is required. Follow-up ultrasound or CT in 6–12 months to confirm stability, then less frequently if unchanged.
- If symptomatic (pain, large size causing mass effect) or recurrent after aspiration: laparoscopic cyst fenestration (unroofing) or resection.
- If abscess: treat with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage.
- If hydatid cyst: specialist management—albendazole therapy plus careful surgical or PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection of scolicide, reaspiration) under experienced teams; avoid blind aspiration without scolicidal precautions.
- If cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma or suspicious lesion: surgical resection is usually recommended.

Red flags — seek prompt care if you develop:
- Fever, worsening RUQ pain, jaundice, increasing size/pain of the lesion, unexplained weight loss, or systemic symptoms.

Practical next steps for you now
1. Obtain a copy of the CT images/report and have them reviewed by a hepatologist or hepatobiliary surgeon (or bring them to your primary care provider for referral).
2. Get LFTs and CRP if not already done; consider hydatid serology if you have relevant animal exposure.
3. If imaging report calls the lesion “simple cyst” with no complex features and you’re asymptomatic: likely observation with interval imaging (6–12 months) is reasonable.
4. If imaging is complex or you develop symptoms: urgent specialist evaluation for further testing or intervention.

I have not had any fever or noticeable weight loss, and I do not have a history of severe illness. I take no medications, do not smoke, and I drink alcohol occasionally, but I do not follow a specific diet.

During the examination, my vital signs were reported to be within normal limits. The doctor noted that my conjunctiva appeared pale. A physical examination of my heart, lungs, abdomen, and extremities did not reveal any abnormalities, and no lymph nodes were enlarged. 

The doctor performed several tests, including a blood test that showed my hemoglobin level was low, and the mean corpuscular volume indicated larger red blood cells. Other blood counts were within expected ranges. An abdominal ultrasound showed no signs of organ enlargement or other issues. A peripheral blood smear revealed large and hypogranular platelets and neutrophils with unusual nuclei. A bone marrow aspiration demonstrated hypercellularity and other specific changes, including ring sideroblasts and disorganized nuclei in megakaryocytes.

I am awaiting further clarification on what these findings mean.",A. Acute myeloid leukemia B. Aplastic anemia C. Myelodysplastic syndrome D. Primary myelofibrosis E. Vitamin B12 deficiency,C,Myelodysplastic syndrome,neutral,"What your test results most likely mean
- The pattern you describe — progressive macrocytic anemia (large red cells), pale conjunctiva, large/hypogranular platelets, neutrophils with abnormal nuclei, a hypercellular marrow with dysplastic megakaryocytes and ring sideroblasts — is most consistent with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  
- MDS is a group of clonal bone‑marrow disorders in older adults that cause ineffective blood-cell production (leading to anemia, sometimes low platelets or neutrophils) and abnormal-looking blood and marrow cells. The ring sideroblasts point toward a subtype in which iron is trapped in developing red‑cell precursors.

Why this explains your symptoms
- Ineffective red‑cell production → anemia → tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion. Other organs/lymph nodes often look normal early on, as in your exam.

What further testing is usually done
- Bone‑marrow biopsy report review (trephine if not already done).  
- Cytogenetics (karyotype and/or FISH) and molecular testing (next‑generation sequencing for mutations such as SF3B1, TET2, ASXL1, SRSF2, TP53). SF3B1 is commonly associated with ring sideroblasts.  
- Simple blood tests to exclude reversible causes: vitamin B12, folate, iron studies, liver tests, thyroid function, reticulocyte count.  
- Complete blood counts repeated over time to follow trends.  
These tests determine the specific MDS subtype and risk category (IPSS‑R), which guide treatment and prognosis.

Typical treatment approaches (tailored to risk and symptoms)
- Supportive care: red‑cell transfusions if symptomatic, iron monitoring/chelation if transfusion dependent, treatment of infections if neutropenic.  
- Erythropoiesis‑stimulating agents (ESAs) can help some patients with low‑risk disease.  
- For MDS with ring sideroblasts and anemia, new agents such as luspatercept may be beneficial in selected patients (often with SF3B1 mutation).  
- Hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine) for higher‑risk disease.  
- Allogeneic stem‑cell transplant is the only curative option but may not be appropriate for most people at age 75 because of risks.  
- Clinical trials are another option to discuss with your hematologist.

Prognosis
- Highly variable. The next-step cytogenetic and molecular results plus marrow blast percentage and blood counts will allow your doctor to assign a risk score (IPSS‑R) and give a more specific prognosis and treatment plan.

Practical next steps for you
- Expect a hematology consultation if you haven’t already had one.  
- Ask about cytogenetic and molecular test results and whether additional basic lab tests (B12/folate/iron) were done.  
- Discuss whether you need transfusions or other immediate treatments, and whether you are a candidate for ESA, luspatercept (if ring sideroblasts), hypomethylating therapy, or clinical trials.

If you’d like, I can:
- Help you draft specific questions to ask your hematologist, or  
- Explain possible test results (e.g., what an SF3B1 mutation means) once your cytogenetics/molecular report is available.",Myelodysplastic syndrome,False,True,True,True,True

Why: in young children rotavirus commonly causes fever and vomiting first, then watery diarrhea, and unvaccinated children are at higher risk of more severe disease and dehydration. Your exam findings (dry mucous membranes, fast heart rate) fit dehydration from acute viral gastroenteritis. Other causes (norovirus, enteric bacteria, toxic exposures from supplements) are possible, but the classic sequence and the lack of vaccination point to rotavirus.

What to do/what they’ll do:
- Diagnosis is usually clinical; stool antigen or PCR can confirm rotavirus if needed.
- Treatment is supportive: oral rehydration for mild–moderate dehydration; IV fluids if more severe or if unable to keep fluids down. Antiemetic (ondansetron) may be used to control vomiting. Antibiotics are not indicated for viral gastroenteritis.
- Monitor hydration, electrolytes, and urine output; isolate to prevent spread.

In an effort to identify any underlying causes of my symptoms, I provided a sample of sputum that was induced with saline. The Gram stain on this sample showed no organisms. However, when the sputum was inoculated on a specialized cell-free medium enriched with yeast extract, horse serum, cholesterol, and penicillin G, colonies began to grow that resembled fried eggs.

Lysosomal acid α-1,4- glucosidase",B,Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: medium‑chain acyl‑CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency — an inborn error of mitochondrial β‑oxidation.

Why this fits
- Age and timing: classically presents in infancy when a baby is stressed by fasting or illness (this was the first time he slept through the night → prolonged fast).
- Typical features: hypoglycemia with little or no ketosis (hypoketotic hypoglycemia), elevated liver enzymes, lethargy and vomiting after fasting/illness.
- Secondary hyperammonemia can occur from liver dysfunction and impaired energy metabolism.
- Newborn screening for MCAD is common in many countries; if he was born in Bolivia he may not have been screened.

Key tests to confirm
- Plasma acylcarnitine profile: elevated medium‑chain species (especially C8, octanoylcarnitine).
- Urine organic acids: increased medium‑chain dicarboxylic acids and medium‑chain acylglycines (e.g., hexanoylglycine).
- Genetic testing of ACADM gene for definitive diagnosis.

Acute management (urgent)
- Stop fasting and give IV dextrose (e.g., D10) to correct hypoglycemia and provide alternative energy.
- Monitor and treat hyperammonemia and acid–base status; admit to ICU if severe.
- Consider IV carnitine supplementation (often used to help clear accumulated fatty acyl intermediates) and supportive care for hepatic dysfunction.
- Treat any underlying infection (tonsillitis/fever).

Long‑term management
- Avoid prolonged fasting; frequent feeds, night feeds or cornstarch/continuous feeds depending on age/plan.
- Emergency protocol for illnesses (rapid provision of glucose).
- Consider chronic L‑carnitine supplementation if recommended by metabolic genetics.

Gilbert syndrome E. Pancreatic cancer,D,Gilbert syndrome,neutral,"Thanks — this is a good summary. Painless jaundice in a young otherwise-healthy man has a fairly short list of leading possibilities. I’ll give the most likely causes, the immediate tests you should get, what the tests will distinguish, and what would require urgent care.

Most likely causes (prioritized)
- Gilbert syndrome — benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia often provoked by stress, fasting, illness; common in young adults and can cause painless mild jaundice with otherwise normal labs.  
- Hemolysis — increased unconjugated bilirubin from red-cell breakdown (immune hemolysis, G6PD flare, hereditary spherocytosis). Usually accompanied by anemia/reticulocytosis, dark urine typically absent because bilirubin is unconjugated.  
- Acute viral hepatitis (A, B, less commonly C, EBV, CMV) — can cause jaundice and usually raises AST/ALT; hepatitis A is possible after travel/food exposures.  
- Drug-induced liver injury (ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone can rarely cause hepatocellular or cholestatic injury).  
- Extrahepatic obstruction (choledocholithiasis, less likely malignancy at your age) — classically causes conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and often dark urine, pale stools, pruritus.  
- Less common/infectious exposures related to hiking (e.g., leptospirosis if freshwater exposure) — think about specific exposure history and systemic symptoms.

Immediate tests to order now
- Basic metabolic panel / liver panel: total and direct (conjugated) bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, albumin, INR/PT. (This tells you cholestatic vs hepatocellular vs unconjugated pattern and synthetic function.)
- CBC with reticulocyte count and peripheral smear. (Look for anemia/hemolysis.)
- Hemolysis markers: haptoglobin, LDH, indirect bilirubin (if not provided), direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test.
- Urinalysis (for bilirubin/urobilinogen; dark urine suggests conjugated hyperbilirubinemia).
- Hepatitis serologies: HAV IgM, HBsAg and anti-HBc IgM, HCV Ab (and HCV RNA if positive). Consider EBV/CMV if clinically suspected.
- INR/PT (if not already included) to assess liver synthetic function.
- If initial labs show cholestatic pattern (elevated direct bilirubin and ALP/GGT), get a right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound to look for bile duct dilation/gallstones. If ultrasound is equivocal and suspicion remains, consider MRCP.
- If labs suggest unconjugated bilirubin with normal other tests, consider testing for Gilbert syndrome (often clinical diagnosis) or G6PD if hemolysis suspected.

When to seek urgent care / call 911
- New or worsening abdominal pain, fever, confusion, sleepiness or bleeding/bruising, difficulty breathing, or any signs of liver failure (severe vomiting, progressive lethargy, confusion). Also seek urgent care if you develop dark urine, very pale stools, or marked worsening of jaundice.

Interim management / precautions
- Stop alcohol and avoid acetaminophen and other potentially hepatotoxic supplements/meds until evaluation. Continue to avoid unprescribed antibiotics.  
- If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, stop the offending drug and discuss with your provider or hepatology.  
- If hemolysis is found, evaluation and treatment will depend on cause (immune hemolysis may require steroids).  
- If obstructive cause is found, GI/surgery referral for possible ERCP or other intervention.

Questions that will help narrow this down
- When exactly did the jaundice start relative to your antibiotic course and hiking trip?  
- Any dark urine or pale stools? Any itch (pruritus)? Fever, chills, abdominal pain, vomiting, or confusion?  
- Any recent sexual exposures, tattoos, piercings, IV drug use, or blood transfusions? Any freshwater exposure (streams, wading) while hiking? Any other medications or herbal supplements?

Kawasaki disease,B,Infective endocarditis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: infective endocarditis (a bacterial infection of the heart lining/valves) due to Streptococcus pyogenes.

Why: 
- You had a congenital VSD, which increases risk for endocarditis.  
- Prolonged fever, new/worse heart murmurs (holosystolic from the VSD and a new early diastolic murmur suggesting aortic valve regurgitation) point to valve involvement.  
- The small non‑blanching purple lesions on palms/soles and under the nails (Janeway lesions/splinter hemorrhages), retinal hemorrhages (Roth spots), and joint pains are classic findings.  
- Dark urine, eyelid/foot swelling suggest blood and protein in the urine from immune-complex–mediated glomerulonephritis, a known complication.  
- Positive blood cultures for S. pyogenes confirm a causative organism.

Immediate next steps (what doctors should do now):
- Start urgent IV antibiotics tailored to the culture and sensitivities.  
- Obtain an echocardiogram (preferably transesophageal) to look for vegetations and valve damage.

Hairy cell leukemia E. Hodgkin lymphoma F. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia G. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,F,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,neutral,"Thank you — this is a helpful summary. I can’t make a definite diagnosis from this information alone, but your findings point strongly toward a lymphoproliferative disorder (most likely chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL) complicated by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Here’s why and what to expect next.

Why CLL is high on the list
- Age (72), generalized, nontender lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly are typical for CLL and some other B‑cell lymphomas.  
- Leukocyte count of 16,000/mm³ (if that reflects a lymphocytosis) fits with CLL; peripheral smear often shows many mature-appearing lymphocytes and “smudge” cells.  
- A positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test means immune‑mediated red‑cell destruction (AIHA), which is a known complication of CLL.

Other possibilities
- Other B‑cell lymphomas (e.g., splenic marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma) can produce similar signs and cause secondary AIHA.  
- Less likely: chronic infections or other autoimmune conditions causing lymphadenopathy and Coombs positivity.

Important next steps your doctor or a hematologist will likely take
- Peripheral blood smear (look for lymphocytosis, smudge cells, abnormal lymphocyte morphology).  
- Flow cytometry / immunophenotyping of peripheral blood to confirm a clonal B‑cell population (CLL typically CD19+, CD5+, CD23+, weak surface Ig).  
- Tests to document hemolysis and guide management: reticulocyte count, LDH, indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, urinalysis for hemoglobinuria.  
- Imaging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis) to assess lymph nodes and organ enlargement.  
- Bone marrow biopsy if diagnosis or staging is unclear.  
- Screening for infections that can trigger hemolysis (HIV, hepatitis) if indicated.

Short-term management considerations
- If hemolysis is active and causing symptoms, treatment is often needed; warm AIHA (IgG, most common in CLL) is usually managed first with corticosteroids.  
- Blood transfusion can be given if needed, but it’s done carefully in AIHA.  
- If hemolysis is refractory or recurrent, therapies directed against the underlying lymphoproliferative disease (rituximab, targeted CLL treatments) may be necessary.

When to seek urgent care
- New or worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fainting, rapid heart rate, severe weakness, or sudden jaundice/dark urine — these can indicate clinically significant anemia or rapid hemolysis and need urgent attention.

What you can do now
- Ask your physician for early hematology referral and for the specific tests above (peripheral smear, flow cytometry, hemolysis labs).  
- Bring a list of symptoms (fevers, night sweats, infections, bleeding/bruising) and any family history of blood cancers to your appointment.

Leukemoid reaction E. Tuberculosis,C,Chronic myeloid leukemia,neutral,"Thanks — this is helpful history. I’ll summarize what’s most concerning, the most likely possibilities, what tests are most important now, and what to expect for next steps.

Key findings
- Age 67, heavy long-term smoker (2–3 packs/day).
- Progressive fatigue, unintentional weight loss, night sweats, mild fever (99.5°F).
- Syncopal episode on exertion.
- Chronic cough and expiratory wheeze.
- Palpable, non‑pulsatile left upper‑quadrant mass (most likely splenomegaly).
- Hypertensive and mildly tachycardic; O2 sat normal.

Most concerning/likely diagnoses to consider (in order)
1. Hematologic malignancy (e.g., lymphoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, other leukemias) — explains splenomegaly, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue/anemia.
2. Chronic infection (e.g., tuberculosis, disseminated mycobacterial or fungal infection, endemic parasites) — travel to Taiwan/Nicaragua, cough, night sweats and splenomegaly raise this possibility.
3. Lung cancer with systemic symptoms or metastatic disease — heavy smoking + cough + weight loss; metastases or paraneoplastic phenomena could explain systemic features.
4. Portal hypertension/cirrhosis with splenomegaly — less likely given only modest alcohol use but still consider if liver disease signs are present.
5. Severe anemia or cardiac arrhythmia causing syncope — the fainting episode may be from anemia (from blood loss, marrow disease) or a cardiac issue; must be assessed urgently.

Immediate and next-step tests (urgent)
- CBC with differential and peripheral smear (look for anemia, leukocytosis/ leukopenia, blasts, abnormal cells).
- Comprehensive metabolic panel (electrolytes, liver function, renal).
- LDH, uric acid, ESR/CRP (markers of cell turnover/inflammation).
- Coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT) if splenomegaly and cytopenias.
- B12, folate, iron studies if anemia present.
- HIV test.
- TB testing (interferon-gamma release assay) and sputum acid‑fast smears/culture if TB is suspected.
- Blood cultures if febrile and ill-appearing.
- Chest X-ray (initial imaging for cough/possible lung cancer or TB).
- ECG and cardiac enzymes (evaluate syncope / tachycardia).
- Abdominal ultrasound (quick assessment of spleen size) and consider CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast if suspicion for malignancy or disseminated disease — CT will evaluate lungs, mediastinum, spleen, and abdominal organs.
- Consider bone marrow biopsy if CBC or smear suggest leukemia/ marrow process.

What the ED/hospital should do now
- Perform the blood tests and imaging listed above promptly.
- If severe anemia, unstable vitals, or active bleeding → transfuse/urgent interventions as indicated.
- If syncope is unexplained by anemia and ECG/troponins abnormal → cardiology evaluation.
- If a mass or abnormal cells are found → urgent hematology/oncology consult for bone marrow biopsy, tissue diagnosis and staging.

Questions that would help narrow the diagnosis
- When did weight loss start? Any fevers/chills pattern? Any night-time cough or blood in sputum?
- Any bleeding/bruising, easy infections, or recent antibiotic use?
- Any prior cancer, hepatitis, or known liver disease?
- Any occupational/animal exposures in Taiwan/Nicaragua (insect bites, fresh water, farm animals)?
- Any medications or over-the-counter supplements?

Practical advice for you now
- If you’re still symptomatic or have recurrent syncope, return to ED immediately.
- Quit smoking as soon as possible and discuss nicotine replacement or meds with your provider.
- Get the tests above and arrange close follow-up with a primary care physician or hematology/oncology depending on the initial results.

My only medications include a multivitamin and occasional acetaminophen to manage the pain. I typically drink 1 to 2 glasses of wine daily. As for my physical measurements, I am 160 cm tall and weigh 79 kg, giving me a BMI of 31.

During my recent examination, my doctor noted mild genu varum in my lower extremities. The range of motion in both knees is limited, and I experience palpable crepitus, as well as pain with complete flexion and extension. Additionally, I have tender nodules on the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of my index, ring, and little fingers on both hands.",A. Gout B. Lyme arthritis C. Rheumathoid arthritis D. Osteoarthritis E. Septic arthritis F. Pseudogout,D,Osteoarthritis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) of the knees and hands.

Why this fits
- Age (58) and progressive joint pain over years.
- Pain worse with use (walking >30 minutes) and with full flexion/extension of the knee — classic mechanical pain.
- Short morning stiffness (~15 minutes) — typical of osteoarthritis (inflammatory arthritis usually causes >30–60 minutes).
- Heberden (DIP) and Bouchard (PIP)–type nodules on the fingers, symmetric involvement of distal/proximal IP joints — characteristic of hand OA (RA typically affects MCP/PIP and causes prolonged stiffness).
- Knee crepitus, limited ROM, and varus alignment — common in knee OA.
- Risk factor present: obesity (BMI 31).

What else to consider
- Inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid) is less likely given the DIP involvement and short stiffness, but would be considered if you develop prolonged morning stiffness, swollen warm joints, or systemic symptoms.
- Lyme arthritis or septic arthritis would usually present differently (more acute or monoarticular, with joint swelling/effusion) — your remote treated tick bite makes this less likely now.

Recommended next steps
1. Imaging
   - Weight-bearing (standing) AP and lateral x-rays of both knees; skyline (patella) view if patellofemoral symptoms.
   - X‑rays of the hands (AP) to document osteophytes, joint-space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis/cysts.

2. Laboratory testing
   - Not routinely needed for classic OA. Consider ESR/CRP and rheumatoid factor/anti-CCP only if you or your doctor suspect inflammatory arthritis (prolonged morning stiffness, true joint swelling, systemic features).

3. Conservative management (first-line)
   - Weight loss: even 5–10% loss reduces knee load and pain. Aim for a gradual program with diet and exercise.
   - Exercise: supervised physical therapy or a regular program focusing on quadriceps strengthening, range of motion, and low-impact aerobic activity (walking, cycling, swimming).
   - Activity modification and use of supportive shoes or shock-absorbing insoles; consider a knee brace/unloader if varus alignment is contributing to medial knee pain.
   - Analgesics: topical NSAID gel (diclofenac) for knees/hands is effective and lower systemic risk; oral NSAIDs for more severe pain if you have no contraindications (use lowest effective dose, short-term if possible). Continue acetaminophen if helpful (but NSAIDs often more effective for OA).
   - Physical measures: heat/ice, assistive devices (cane), joint protection techniques.

4. If symptoms remain problematic
   - Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for short-term knee pain relief.
   - Viscosupplementation (hyaluronic acid) has mixed evidence; discuss risks/benefits with your clinician.
   - Consider referral to orthopedics for knee replacement evaluation if symptoms are severe, radiographs show advanced OA, and conservative care fails to restore function/quality of life.

When to see a specialist sooner
- New or worsening symmetrical small-joint swelling, prolonged morning stiffness >30–60 minutes, systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss), or rapidly worsening joint deformity — see a rheumatologist.
- Persistent, disabling knee pain despite conservative therapy — see orthopedics for possible surgical options.

114,"I am a 78-year-old man who recently visited my primary care physician due to persistent back pain. This pain had been bothering me for some time, but it intensified after I helped my son move heavy furniture last weekend. Since then, the discomfort has become constant and occurs throughout the day.

In addition to the back pain, I have noticed a recent weight loss of about 15 pounds and have been dealing with constipation. During my visit, my temperature was recorded at 99.5°F, my blood pressure was 137/79 mmHg, my pulse was 90 beats per minute, and my respirations were 15 per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

The cardiovascular examination revealed a murmur at the right sternal border that radiates to my carotids. The pulmonary exam showed mild crackles in the lower parts of my lungs. My back examination indicated mild tenderness in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine, but there were no signs of bruising or external trauma. Lying down or lifting my leg did not worsen the pain. My strength was normal in both my lower and upper extremities, and sensation was intact bilaterally.

Following my consultation, laboratory tests were ordered, and I await their results for further evaluation.",A. Muscle strain B. Herniated nucleus pulposus C. Sciatic nerve irritation D. Piriformis muscle inflammation E. Plasma cell dyscrasia,E,Plasma cell dyscrasia,neutral,"Thanks — this is helpful detail. Key points from your history that change how worried I’d be about your back pain:
- Age > 50 with new, persistent back pain that is constant (not just aching after lifting).  
- Unintentional 15-lb weight loss, constipation and low‑grade fever.  
- Pain not provoked by lying down or straight‑leg raise, and a normal neurologic exam (no weakness, numbness, bowel/bladder changes) now.
These are “red flags” for a non‑mechanical cause of back pain (rather than a simple muscle strain).

Most likely possibilities (in order of concern)
1. Metastatic cancer to the spine (common in elderly men; prostate, lung, kidney, and others can present with constant pain and weight loss).  
2. Multiple myeloma (older adults, back pain, weight loss, constipation can be caused by hypercalcemia).  
3. Vertebral compression fracture (possible after lifting, but usually there is focal point pain and sometimes increased pain with movement/position changes).  
4. Spinal infection/epidural abscess (less likely with only low‑grade fever and no neurologic signs, but still a concern when fever + back pain).  
5. Mechanical strain is possible but less likely given systemic signs (weight loss, fever) and age.

What I would recommend right away
- Urgent imaging of your spine: MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine with contrast is the best test to look for metastatic disease, myeloma lesions, fracture, or infection. If MRI is not available, a CT or plain X‑rays are second line but less sensitive.  
- Blood tests now (many of these are likely what your doctor ordered): CBC, ESR and CRP, basic metabolic panel (including calcium and creatinine), liver tests, alkaline phosphatase, prostate‑specific antigen (PSA), and serum protein electrophoresis/urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP/UPEP) to evaluate for multiple myeloma. Blood cultures if there is concern for infection.  
- If imaging or labs suggest cancer, you’ll need staging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis or PET) and referral to oncology. If myeloma is suspected, hematology referral and bone marrow biopsy may be needed.  
- Because you have a murmur radiating to the carotids and mild crackles, an outpatient echocardiogram and a clinical assessment for heart failure/aortic stenosis are reasonable, but that is separate from urgent spine evaluation.

When to go to the emergency department now
- New or progressive leg weakness, numbness, difficulty walking, loss of bladder or bowel control — go to ED immediately (possible spinal cord/cauda equina compression).  
- High fever, severe worsening pain, or signs of sepsis — go to ED.

Practical advice until tests are back
- Avoid heavy lifting or straining. Use acetaminophen or short‑term nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs if allowed by your doctor for pain.  
- Contact your PCP promptly to expedite MRI and the blood tests if they haven’t been done yet.

Why: sudden epigastric pain with vomiting in a patient with heavy alcohol use, tachycardia, and diffuse/epigastric abdominal tenderness strongly favor pancreatitis. The positive Murphy sign and obesity raise the possibility of gallbladder disease, and history of PUD/NSAID use raises concern for perforation, but she is afebrile (less typical for cholecystitis), and the alcohol history plus epigastric distribution make pancreatitis most likely.

Immediate next steps: check serum lipase (and amylase), basic labs (CBC, CMP, LFTs, triglycerides), IV fluids, analgesia, NPO, and consider abdominal CT if diagnosis or complications are unclear.

Reason: the combination of fever and recent right-sided ear infection, severe headache, bilateral papilledema (raised intracranial pressure), absent right corneal reflex and reduced sensation in the right V1/V2 distribution (trigeminal nerve involvement), and elevated fibrin degradation products (evidence of thrombosis) is classic for thrombosis of the cavernous sinus from a contiguous septic source. Cavernous sinus involvement typically produces cranial nerve III, IV, V1/V2 and VI deficits and can be bilateral because of intercavernous connections.

At the clinic, an ECG confirmed that I was experiencing a STEMI, and I was given aspirin. Unfortunately, while being transported by ambulance, there was an accident that delayed my arrival at the hospital.

Why: this classically occurs 3–7 days after a transmural MI (your STEMI, delayed reperfusion, age and female sex are risk factors). The sudden collapse with absent palpable pulse, raised jugular venous pressure and distant (muffled) heart sounds is Beck’s triad of tamponade from blood filling the pericardial sac.

Immediate steps (urgent/emergent):
- Bedside transthoracic echocardiogram now to confirm large pericardial effusion/tamponade and identify active bleeding.
- Emergency pericardiocentesis as a temporizing measure to relieve tamponade and restore circulation.
- Immediate cardiothoracic surgery consultation for definitive repair (often requires urgent surgical exploration/sternotomy).

""",B,Poliomyelitis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: acute flaccid paralysis from poliomyelitis (wild-type poliovirus).

Why: 
- Unvaccinated, recent arrival from Pakistan (area with endemic poliovirus) — high epidemiologic risk.  
- Recent febrile, flu‑like prodrome 1 week before onset of weakness (fits polio incubation).  
- Asymmetric flaccid weakness with reduced/absent deep‑tendon reflexes (anterior horn cell LMN pattern).  
- CSF shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis (38 cells/mm3, 68% lymphs), mildly elevated protein (49 mg/dL) and normal glucose — pattern typical of a viral myelitis/aseptic meningitis such as poliomyelitis.  
- Guillain‑Barré syndrome is less likely because GBS usually causes symmetric weakness and classically has albuminocytologic dissociation (markedly elevated protein with very few cells), which is not the case here.

Immediate recommended actions (urgent): 
- Notify public health/CDC (polio is immediately reportable).  
- Obtain diagnostic specimens for enterovirus/polio PCR: multiple stool samples (best yield), throat swab, and send CSF for enterovirus PCR if available.  
- Strict contact precautions and consider immunization/prophylaxis for close contacts per public health guidance.

Supraventricular tachycardia,D,Premature atrial contractions,neutral,"I can’t make a definitive diagnosis without seeing the ECG tracing, but given your age, sudden persistent palpitations and a heart rate of 124 bpm while you are otherwise hemodynamically stable, the most likely possibilities are:

- Sinus tachycardia (common with stress, anxiety, lots of caffeine) — ECG: regular rhythm, a normal P wave before each QRS.
- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT, e.g. AVNRT/AVRT) — ECG: usually a regular, narrow-complex tachycardia, abrupt onset/termination, P waves often hidden or abnormal.
- Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response — ECG: irregularly irregular rhythm with no distinct P waves.
- Atrial flutter with variable block — ECG: sawtooth atrial waves (rate ~250–350/min); ventricular rate can be ~120–150 with 2:1 or variable conduction.

What to tell me / what’s most helpful
- Upload a photo of the ECG or describe it: is the rhythm regular or irregular? Are there visible P waves before each QRS? Are the QRS complexes narrow or wide? Any “sawtooth” pattern?

Immediate management (given you are stable)
- If this is sinus tachycardia from caffeine/anxiety: stop caffeine, rest, hydration, and symptoms often improve.
- If SVT and symptomatic: vagal maneuvers (e.g., carotid sinus massage only under supervision, or Valsalva) can terminate it; adenosine or intravenous rate control may be used in ED by clinicians.
- If atrial fibrillation/flutter with fast rate: rate control (beta‑blocker or diltiazem) and cardiology follow-up; anticoagulation decisions depend on rhythm duration and stroke risk.
- If you become lightheaded, faint, have chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or low blood pressure, seek immediate care (possible unstable arrhythmia).

Follow-up
- If this is a first symptomatic episode, arrange outpatient cardiology follow-up. They may get a 24–48 hour Holter or event monitor, and possibly an echocardiogram or further testing if recurrent or abnormal.

Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia from accessory conduction pathway C. Premature ventricular complex D. Intense emotional episodes,B,Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia from accessory conduction pathway,neutral,"What most likely happened
- Your presentation (sudden rapid regular heartbeat, shortness of breath, lightheadedness) and the fact that an IV dose of adenosine stopped it strongly suggests a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) — most commonly AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or an AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). These are electrical “reentry” rhythms that use the AV node to sustain a fast regular heartbeat.
- Adenosine briefly blocks conduction through the AV node and often interrupts the reentrant circuit, restoring normal sinus rhythm. It works very quickly and its effects are short lived, which is why symptoms resolved soon after administration.

What this means for you now
- If you have no other cardiac history and your post‑treatment ECG and vital signs are normal, the immediate risk is low.
- Many people with a first isolated SVT episode never have another, but some have recurrences.

Next steps and reasonable recommendations
- Follow up with a cardiologist (electrophysiologist if available), ideally within a few weeks. Bring copies of the ED/clinic ECGs and a report of the event.
- If palpitations recur, ambulatory monitoring (Holter or event monitor) is often used to document rhythm during symptoms.
- If episodes are recurrent or frequent and are troublesome, catheter ablation is a highly effective and usually curative option for common SVTs (success rates >90% with low complication rates).
- Medical therapy (beta‑blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium‑channel blockers) is an alternative if you prefer to avoid ablation or if ablation isn’t indicated.

Practical advice and triggers
- Common triggers include caffeine, alcohol, stimulants, dehydration, vigorous exercise, or stress. Keeping a log of circumstances around any future episodes can help identify triggers.
- After an episode, avoid driving until you feel well and discuss restrictions with your clinician if you have recurrent episodes.

When to seek immediate care
- Recurrent prolonged palpitations with dizziness, fainting, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or if your blood pressure is low or you feel very unwell.

(Other possibilities to consider quickly: exertional heat stroke given the construction‑site setting, prolonged seizure/status epilepticus with postictal confusion, or severe infection — these change immediate steps only slightly and should be evaluated in parallel.)

Immediate actions (urgent):
- Stop all dopamine‑blocking medications immediately (hold haloperidol).
- Begin aggressive supportive care: airway/oxygen as needed, IV access, large‑volume isotonic fluids, continuous cardiac monitoring, and external cooling (cooling blankets, ice packs to groin/axillae/neck; for exertional heat stroke consider ice‑water immersion if available).
- Give benzodiazepines for agitation/possible rigidity/seizure prophylaxis (e.g., IV lorazepam).
- If NMS is strongly suspected and patient is deteriorating or rigid/high CK: give IV dantrolene (muscle relaxant). Consider oral bromocriptine or amantadine (dopamine agonists) when appropriate.
- Monitor urine output closely (risk of rhabdomyolysis → myoglobinuria → AKI); place Foley if needed.

Essential immediate investigations:
- Serum CK, basic metabolic panel (incl. creatinine, K+), liver enzymes, CBC, coagulation panel, lactate, arterial blood gas, urine myoglobin/UA
- Blood cultures and chest x‑ray if infection suspected
- Toxicology screen, serum drug levels if applicable
- ECG (tachyarrhythmia evaluation)
- If seizure suspected: glucose, AED levels, and consider EEG and head CT if focal/neuro deficits

- Admit to monitored setting/ICU.
- If CK is very high and renal function worsening, treat rhabdomyolysis aggressively (IV fluids, urinary alkalinization as indicated) and consult nephrology for possible dialysis.

I am unsure what these episodes may signify and seek further understanding of the situation.",A. Simple partial B. Complex partial C. Absence D. Tonic-clonic E. Myoclonic,A,Simple partial,neutral,"Thanks — that’s a helpful description. Short answer: the combination of a brief smell hallucination (phantosmia — “sour milk”) together with tingling in the fingers and intact awareness is most suggestive of a focal (partial, “focal aware”) seizure, most commonly arising from the temporal lobe (olfactory auras/uncinate fits). It can occur with a normal brain MRI and with a normal routine EEG.

Why this fits
- Olfactory auras are a classic simple focal seizure symptom (you typically stay conscious and may report an unpleasant or unusual smell).  
- Focal seizures can produce sensory symptoms (tingling) from spread to somatosensory areas.  
- Lack of loss of consciousness, confusion, incontinence favors a focal aware seizure rather than generalized seizure.  
- Normal MRI and normal initial labs do not exclude epilepsy; many people with focal seizures have normal imaging/interictal EEGs.

Other possibilities (less likely given your presentation)
- Migraine aura (but usually with head pain or longer evolving symptoms).  
- Transient ischemic event (sensory TIAs are possible but olfactory hallucinations are unusual).  
- Peripheral/ENT causes of phantosmia (sinus disease, olfactory nerve irritation) — more likely if the smell occurs alone.  
- Medication or metabolic causes (your metformin and normal labs make this unlikely).

Recommended next steps
1. Neurology follow-up — ideally an epilepsy specialist if available.  
2. EEG: get a routine EEG and, if nondiagnostic, consider sleep-deprived, ambulatory (24–72 h) or inpatient video-EEG monitoring to try to capture an event. Be aware interictal EEG can be normal even with epilepsy.  
3. Keep a detailed diary of any future episodes (time, duration, exact symptoms, triggers, recovery) and try to make a short video if you have repeated episodes.  
4. ENT evaluation only if the smell episodes occur in isolation or there are nasal symptoms.  
5. Safety: avoid driving, swimming alone, or climbing ladders until a neurologist clears you (local regulations may apply). Check blood glucose at the time of any future episode to exclude hypoglycemia.  
6. If episodes recur, worsen, or you develop loss of awareness, confusion, weakness, or speech problems — go to the emergency department.

Treatment considerations
- If focal seizures are confirmed or episodes recur frequently, your neurologist may recommend starting an antiseizure medication. If this was a single isolated event, many specialists will monitor first.

Additionally, muscle strength and sensation appeared normal in my remaining extremities and in my left leg. I am now seeking to understand the cause of the pain I have been experiencing since the amputation.",A. Phantom limb pain B. Foreign body reaction C. Reinfarction D. Diabetic neuropathy E. Osteomyelitis,A,Phantom limb pain,neutral,"Short answer: your symptoms most likely reflect neuropathic stump pain — most commonly a painful neuroma of a transected nerve in the residual limb — or less likely early phantom-limb pain. Both are common soon after amputation, especially after an ischemic event.

Why:
- “Hot, shooting, tingling” pain in the stump is typical of neuropathic pain from a neuroma (a disorganized regrowth of a cut peripheral nerve). Neuroma pain is often sharp, electric/shooting, and can be triggered by pressure on the stump.
- Phantom-limb pain (pain perceived in the missing part of the limb) can also be burning/shooting and may begin soon after amputation.
- Infection or ongoing ischemia can cause stump pain but your exam (low-grade erythema only, clean sutures, stable vitals) doesn’t strongly suggest an acute wound infection or sepsis right now. Your diabetes and smoking increase the risk of poor healing and neuropathy, though.

What to check now:
- Tell your surgeon or limb-care team whether the pain is reproduced by touching or tapping the stump (a positive Tinel-like sign suggests a neuroma).
- Watch for red flags and seek urgent care if you develop fever, rapidly spreading redness, increased drainage or foul smell, severe worsening pain, or loss of pulses in the remaining limb.

Tests that can help:
- Focused exam (Tinel over suspected nerve sites).
- Ultrasound or MRI of the stump to look for neuroma or collection.
- Diagnostic local anesthetic nerve/stump block to see if pain temporarily resolves.
- Nerve conduction/EMG if a broader neuropathy is suspected.

Typical treatment options:
- Conservative/first-line: optimize wound care and diabetes control, stop smoking if possible, and begin neuropathic pain medications (eg, gabapentin or pregabalin; or amitriptyline in appropriate patients) under physician supervision.
- Local treatments: steroid/local anesthetic injections or ultrasound-guided neuroma injections; TENS.
- Nonpharmacologic for phantom pain: mirror therapy, graded motor imagery, physiotherapy, cognitive behavioral approaches.
- If refractory: surgical options (neuroma excision/revision, targeted muscle reinnervation, or other procedures) or interventional pain procedures (nerve ablation) after specialist assessment.

Next steps I recommend:
1. Report these symptoms to your surgeon/pain clinic if you haven’t already.
2. Note whether touching the stump reproduces the shooting pain and tell them.
3. Start or be evaluated for a neuropathic pain medication (discuss dosing and interactions with your clinicians).
4. Arrange imaging/diagnostic block if your team suspects a neuroma.
5. Work with your providers on smoking cessation and tighter diabetes control to promote healing.

If you want, tell me whether the pain is triggered by touch or pressure, whether it feels like it comes from the stump itself or from the missing foot/ankle area, and how severe it is; I can give more specific likely diagnoses and typical medication options.",Phantom limb pain,False,False,False,False,True
125,"I was taken to the emergency department because I had been experiencing severe abdominal pain for the past week. My father explained to the physician that the stomach aches were intermittent, and whenever they occurred, I would cry and pull my knees to my chest, which seemed to help a bit. My parents also mentioned that I had been having mucousy stools, and sometimes there was bright red blood, along with clots. They noted that I had never felt this kind of abdominal pain before.

I was born at 39 weeks gestation through a spontaneous vaginal delivery, and my vaccination schedule is up to date. I am meeting all my developmental milestones. During the examination, the doctors found my vital signs were mostly normal, but I had a slight fever and was mildly tachycardic. I felt quite uncomfortable during the exam.

Propranolol overdose,A,Dumping syndrome,neutral,"Thanks — this sounds worrisome and it’s good you went to the ED. Based on what you described (acute confusion + vomiting/diarrhea, tachycardia, low-ish blood pressure, recent sleeve gastrectomy, diabetes, prior suicide attempts), the ED team will be thinking about several urgent causes and will run tests/treatments in parallel.

Most important possibilities (prioritized)
- Dehydration/hypovolemia from vomiting/diarrhea causing delirium and tachycardia
- Metabolic problems: hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia/diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), electrolyte disturbances (Na, K, Mg, phosphate) that cause confusion
- Infection/sepsis
- Medication or toxin ingestion/overdose (given history of prior attempts)
- Post-bariatric nutritional deficiency — thiamine deficiency/Wernicke encephalopathy can present with confusion after prolonged vomiting
- Less likely but considered: stroke/intracranial problem, hepatic/uremic encephalopathy

What they should check urgently
- Fingerstick glucose right away (fastest)
- Basic metabolic panel (Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, BUN/creatinine), magnesium, phosphate
- Venous blood gas or basic acid–base testing and lactate; serum/urine ketones if DKA suspected
- CBC, blood cultures if sepsis suspected
- Liver tests, coagulation if encephalopathy considered
- ECG (tachycardia, medication effects, electrolyte abnormalities)
- Urine pregnancy test (if applicable), toxicology screen, acetaminophen/aspirin levels
- CT head if focal neuro signs or concern for bleed/stroke

Typical immediate treatments you can expect
- Stabilization (IV access, monitoring) and IV isotonic fluids for dehydration/low BP
- Correct glucose if low or treat DKA if present (insulin, fluids, electrolytes)
- Replace significant electrolytes (K/Mg/Phos) as needed
- Antiemetics and hold oral intake
- If overdose suspected, specific antidotes if indicated (e.g., naloxone for opioids)
- Empiric antibiotics only if infection/sepsis suspected
- If thiamine deficiency/Wernicke is a concern (post‑op with persistent vomiting and confusion), clinicians commonly give IV thiamine right away — this is safe and important before giving glucose

What you can do or tell the team
- Tell staff about all medications, supplements, and whether you’ve taken anything intentionally
- Mention your psychiatric history and any recent suicidal thoughts or actions
- Report timing/amount of vomiting, diarrhea, oral intake, and any weakness or vision/coordination changes

Prognosis/expectations
- Many causes of acute delirium reverse quickly once the underlying problem (fluids, glucose, electrolytes, infection, overdose) is treated
- Nutritional deficiencies (like thiamine) should be treated promptly to prevent lasting brain injury

Upon arrival at the emergency department, my vital signs were taken. My temperature was measured at 98.4°F, my blood pressure was recorded at 137/77 mmHg, my pulse was 90 beats per minute, and my respirations were 17 per minute.

At your age and with new chest pain and lightheadedness, the ED will treat you as a potential heart attack while they complete testing.

What the ED should do right now (and what you can expect)
- Place you on continuous cardiac monitoring and get IV access.
- Give chewable aspirin 325 mg immediately unless there’s a clear contraindication.
- Obtain bloodwork including cardiac troponin (baseline and serial), BMP, CBC, and coagulation studies.
- Repeat ECGs and obtain serial troponins (typical timing: 0 and ~3 hours; with high‑sensitivity assays timing may be shorter per local protocol).
- If the ECG shows ST‑elevation → urgent reperfusion (primary PCI/cath lab).
- If ECG/troponins suggest non‑ST elevation ACS → cardiology evaluation for medical therapy and possible invasive testing.
- Get a chest X‑ray and consider bedside echocardiogram if there are signs of heart failure, tamponade, or concern for other causes.
- If exam or history strongly suggests aortic dissection (severe tearing pain radiating to the back, unequal pulses or blood pressures in the arms, new aortic regurgitation murmur), do NOT give anticoagulants and obtain an urgent CT angiogram of the chest.

Things to know
- An initial troponin can be normal early after symptom onset; serial testing is crucial.
- Oxygen is given only if oxygen saturation <94% or if respiratory distress.
- Nitroglycerin can help chest pain if you’re not hypotensive and have no recent phosphodiesterase‑5 inhibitor use; this is guided by the treating physician.

You did a great job going to the doctor.

What might be going on
- After chemo, sometimes a lot of cancer cells die quickly and release chemicals into the blood. This is called tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).  
- TLS can make you feel sick (nausea, vomiting), make you pee less, cause swelling in your feet, and change things in your blood that can be hard on the kidneys and heart.

Tests the doctor mentioned
- Blood tests to check:
  - Electrolytes (potassium, phosphate, calcium) — because they can get too high or too low.
  - Uric acid — it can get high and hurt the kidneys.
  - BUN and creatinine — to see how well the kidneys are working.
  - Sometimes LDH and a complete blood count.
- Urinalysis (pee test) to look for crystals or blood and to see how concentrated the urine is.

Why they do these tests
- To see if TLS or kidney injury is happening and how bad it is, so the doctors can treat it quickly.

How it’s treated (what the doctors might do)
- Give fluids through an IV to help your kidneys and make you pee more.  
- Medicines to lower uric acid (like allopurinol or rasburicase).  
- Medicines or treatments to fix electrolytes if they are too high or low.  
- In severe cases, dialysis (a machine that helps clean the blood) can be needed.

When to tell an adult or call the doctor right away
- If you pee very little or not at all, are throwing up a lot, feel very weak, have muscle cramps, numbness/tingling, dizzy spells, or feel strange heartbeats or trouble breathing — tell your parent and call the clinic or go to the ER.

The doctors are watching closely and will do these tests and treatments if needed. If you or your mom want, you can ask them to explain the blood test results and what they plan to do next.

- Severe left shoulder pain after abdominal trauma is classic referred pain from diaphragmatic irritation by blood under the left hemidiaphragm (Kehr sign).
- Tachycardia and borderline hypotension after resuscitation suggest ongoing intra‑abdominal bleeding/hemorrhagic shock.
- FAST exam is the correct bedside test to look for free intraperitoneal fluid; a positive FAST would support this diagnosis.

Usual next steps:
- Continue resuscitation (IV fluids, blood products, vasopressors as needed) and urgent surgical trauma consult.
- If hemodynamically unstable or FAST positive with hypotension → emergent laparotomy.

I understand that my medical history and recent events have contributed to my current condition, and I am aware that my missed dialysis and medication noncompliance may have played a role in the deterioration of my health.",A. Cardiac tamponade B. Hyperkalemia C. Myocardial infarction D. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy E. Tension pneumothorax,A,Cardiac tamponade,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: cardiac tamponade from a large pericardial effusion. 

Why: bedside ultrasound shows an anechoic rim (pericardial effusion) plus right‑ventricular diastolic collapse and poor cardiac squeeze, and you are hypotensive and tachycardic — classic tamponade physiology. Presence of pleural sliding argues against pneumothorax. Given missed dialysis, uremic/pericarditis with effusion is a likely cause; other possibilities include hemorrhagic effusion (post‑MI free‑wall rupture) or malignant/infectious effusion.

Immediate management (what needs to happen now)
1. Emergent pericardiocentesis (ultrasound‑guided) or urgent surgical drainage (pericardial window/median sternotomy) — do not delay definitive drainage if hemodynamically unstable.  
2. While preparing/performing drainage: give cautious IV fluid bolus to augment preload as a temporizing measure, and start vasopressor support (norepinephrine) if hypotension persists.  
3. Oxygen and monitor continuous ECG and pulse ox. Avoid elective positive‑pressure ventilation if possible until tamponade relieved.  
4. Call cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery immediately.

Key diagnostics to obtain concurrently
- Stat portable echo/formal transthoracic echo to confirm tamponade and guide drainage  
- ECG, CBC, BMP (check potassium), coagulation profile, type & cross (in case surgery/transfusion needed), troponin  
- If uremia suspected, arrange urgent dialysis once stabilized.

Important considerations
- If post‑MI free‑wall rupture is suspected (sudden collapse, hemopericardium), surgical intervention is required urgently.  
- Because you missed dialysis, uremic pericarditis with effusion is very possible and dialysis helps treat the underlying cause after drainage.  
- This is a life‑threatening emergency — pericardiocentesis/surgical drainage is the priority.

Sodium channel abnormality,C,Fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium,neutral,"Thanks — that’s helpful info. Palpitations followed immediately by a brief loss of consciousness most often means a transient drop in blood flow to the brain caused by a change in heart rhythm (an arrhythmia) or, less commonly, a reflex faint (vasovagal) or other cause. Because syncope that follows palpitations can sometimes reflect a potentially serious arrhythmia, prompt evaluation is important.

What matters now
- The 12‑lead ECG the ED did is the key first test. Certain ECG findings (ongoing rapid rhythm, wide‑complex tachycardia, high‑grade AV block, pre‑excitation/WPW, long QT, or acute ischemic changes) require urgent treatment and cardiology involvement. If the ECG is normal, you can still have an intermittent arrhythmia and will need further monitoring.
- Because you had true loss of consciousness, most providers will recommend additional testing even if the ED ECG is normal.

Likely next steps your doctors will recommend
- Review of the ED ECG (if you want, tell me the result or upload it and I can help interpret).
- Blood tests: electrolytes, cardiac enzymes (if indicated), and often thyroid function.
- Echocardiogram to look for structural heart disease if indicated.
- Ambulatory rhythm monitoring (24–48 hr Holter, 2–4 week patch, or an implantable loop recorder if events are rare) to catch intermittent arrhythmias.
- Cardiology referral (electrophysiology if an arrhythmia is suspected). Tilt‑table testing only if vasovagal syncope is suspected after cardiac causes are excluded.

Immediate precautions
- Avoid driving, climbing, or operating heavy machinery until cleared by a clinician.
- Avoid stimulants (excess caffeine, decongestants, cocaine, amphetamines) and alcohol until evaluated.
- Return to the ED immediately if you have recurrent fainting, chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or a prolonged rapid pulse.

Questions that will help clarify cause (please answer if you can)
- Did you have any warning symptoms (lightheadedness, nausea, sweating) before fainting or was it sudden?
- How long did the palpitations and unconsciousness last?
- Any family history of sudden cardiac death, unexplained fainting, or inherited heart disease?
- Any medications, supplements, or recreational drug use?
- Any prior similar episodes, chest pain, or heart murmur?

The physician conducted a further examination and found a grade III holosystolic murmur over my anterior chest wall. After my heart rate was reduced, an ECG was performed to get a better understanding of my condition. The results showed a short P-R interval along with a slow upstroke of the QRS complex. 

This experience was concerning for both me and my parents, but I was reassured that the medical team was working to determine the cause of my symptoms.",A. Pulmonic stenosis B. Tricuspid atresia C. Ebstein anomaly D. Tetralogy of Fallot E. Atrial septal defect,C,Ebstein anomaly,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome with an atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT).  

Why: the ECG description — short PR interval and a slow, slurred upstroke of the QRS (a delta wave) — is classic for pre-excitation through an accessory pathway (Bundle of Kent). That accessory pathway allows a re-entry circuit that commonly causes very fast supraventricular tachycardia (your HR ≈198). The holosystolic murmur over the anterior chest wall suggests tricuspid regurgitation, and WPW is classically associated with Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve, so an echocardiogram should be done to look for that structural abnormality.

Immediate/near-term considerations:
- Acute, stable orthodromic AVRT is often treated with vagal maneuvers and, if needed, IV adenosine (given in monitored setting).
- If the rhythm is atrial fibrillation with pre-excitation, avoid AV‑node–only blockers (e.g., beta‑blockers, CCBs, digoxin) because they can paradoxically accelerate conduction over the accessory pathway and risk ventricular fibrillation; use procainamide or perform electrical cardioversion if unstable.
- Arrange cardiology/electrophysiology follow-up; catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is frequently curative and is the preferred long‑term treatment for symptomatic WPW. Also get an echocardiogram to evaluate for Ebstein anomaly or other structural heart disease.

Transient ischemic attack,D,Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations,neutral,"Thanks — this sounds like a classic acute stroke presentation (sudden right-sided weakness and new aphasia localize to the left middle-cerebral-artery territory). I can help interpret the CT and advise about likely diagnosis and next steps, but I need either the CT images or the formal CT report (and a few clinical details) to be specific.

Brief overview and what’s most important now
- Two main possibilities in the acute setting: ischemic stroke (arterial blockage) or intracerebral hemorrhage. The non-contrast head CT’s first purpose is to exclude acute hemorrhage because that immediately changes treatment.
- If the CT shows no bleed (acute blood appears hyperdense/white), and you’re within the treatment window (generally ≤4.5 hours from symptom onset), IV thrombolysis (alteplase) can be considered if there are no contraindications. If there is a large vessel occlusion on CT angiography, mechanical thrombectomy may be indicated (up to 6–24 hours in selected patients).
- If the CT shows an acute hemorrhage, treatment is entirely different (blood-pressure lowering, reversal of any anticoagulation, neurosurgical consultation).

How the CT helps (what I’d look for)
- Acute intracerebral hemorrhage: focal hyperdense (bright/white) blood collection, often with mass effect.
- Early ischemic changes: sulcal effacement, loss of gray–white differentiation, “hyperdense MCA” sign for a clot in the MCA.
- A normal/near-normal non-contrast CT does not exclude acute ischemia early on — it’s common to be normal in the first few hours.

Important clinical details I need to advise further
- Exact time symptoms began (or last known well)?
- Are you currently on any blood thinners (warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) or taking aspirin/clopidogrel?
- Current blood pressure and heart rate, and any other vitals?
- Lab results available: platelets, INR/PT, PTT, blood glucose, creatinine, hemoglobin/hematocrit values you mentioned?
- Is the CT report available, or can you upload the CT image(s)?
- Any treatments already given in the ED?

Relevant points about your history
- Elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit raises concern for increased blood viscosity or polycythemia (which increases thrombosis risk) — this could favor an ischemic event. Polycythemia vera is one possibility (JAK2 testing, EPO level, hematology follow-up).
- Recurrent nosebleeds and prior GI bleeding suggest either an underlying bleeding tendency or prior use of anticoagulants — both are critical when considering thrombolysis. Please tell me about any current anticoagulant use.
- Family history of hemorrhagic stroke is important to note but doesn’t change the immediate imaging interpretation — it may affect long-term workup.

Immediate next steps to expect or request in the ED (if not already done)
- Get the CT images/report to confirm hemorrhage vs no hemorrhage.
- If CT shows no bleed and you’re within window: evaluate for IV alteplase eligibility (requires platelet count/INR/glucose and no recent major bleeding or contraindications).
- Obtain CT angiography (head and neck) to look for large vessel occlusion for thrombectomy eligibility.
- Labs: CBC (platelets), coagulation panel (INR/PT/PTT), glucose, creatinine.
- BP management: different targets depending on hemorrhage vs thrombolysis eligibility (tell me current BP).
- Stroke team/neurovascular consult.

If you can, please either paste the CT report text or upload the CT image(s) and give the time of symptom onset and medication list (especially any blood thinners).

136,"I am a 55-year-old man who recently went to the emergency department due to experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. I have a history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Upon arrival, my temperature was recorded at 98.6°F, and my blood pressure was quite high at 177/118 mmHg. My pulse was 127 beats per minute, and my respirations were 11 breaths per minute, while my oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.

After my initial assessment, an electrocardiogram was performed, and I was treated with aspirin and metoprolol. Following this treatment, I was transferred to the medical floor for further care. 

On the second day of my hospitalization, I began to experience abdominal pain. During this time, my serum lipase level was measured at 272 U/L, and my creatinine level was recorded at 1.6 mg/dL. The physical examination revealed notable findings, and I requested pain medication for my abdominal discomfort.",A. Cholesterol embolism B. Heart failure and reinfarction C. Medication side effect D. Pancreatitis E. Renal failure,A,Cholesterol embolism,neutral,"Likely diagnosis
- This presentation (new severe abdominal pain with an elevated serum lipase) is most consistent with acute pancreatitis. A lipase ~272 U/L is often diagnostic when it is ≥3× the lab’s upper limit of normal; if your lab’s upper limit is lower than ~90 U/L this meets that threshold. Even if it is only mildly elevated, the combination of compatible pain and lipase rise is concerning.

Important immediate actions (what your team should do now)
1. Supportive care
   - NPO (nothing by mouth) initially.
   - Early aggressive IV fluid resuscitation (usually lactated Ringer’s unless contraindicated): bolus then frequent reassessments of perfusion, respiratory status, and urine output.
   - Adequate analgesia (IV opioid pain control such as hydromorphone or fentanyl) and antiemetic therapy (ondansetron).
   - Monitor vitals, oxygenation, urine output, and labs (serial BMP/CMP, CBC).

2. Targeted testing to identify cause and assess severity
   - Right upper quadrant ultrasound to look for gallstones/sludge (most common cause).
   - Serum triglycerides (very high triglycerides can cause pancreatitis).
   - Liver tests (ALP, AST, ALT, bilirubin) — a cholestatic pattern suggests gallstone etiology.
   - Serum calcium.
   - Repeat renal function and BUN (renal impairment can both raise lipase and worsen prognosis).
   - Consider scoring severity (BISAP) and consult GI if moderate–severe features.

3. Imaging
   - If diagnosis is uncertain or pain/worsening persists despite therapy, abdominal CT (ideally without IV contrast if kidney function is impaired; use contrast cautiously if creatinine is elevated and benefits outweigh risks).
   - RUQ ultrasound first to evaluate for biliary cause.

4. Modify medications and care given comorbidities
   - Evaluate medications for potential drug-induced pancreatitis (most common offenders are diuretics, some antibiotics, ACE inhibitors, etc.; aspirin and metoprolol are not typical causes).
   - Because you recently had chest pain/possible MI, fluid resuscitation should be balanced if there is heart failure or ischemia risk — the team should coordinate with cardiology.
   - Avoid nephrotoxic contrast if creatinine 1.6 is thought to be acute or rising.

When to escalate/seek specialty input
- Transfer to higher level care or involve GI/critical care if you develop hypotension, worsening hypoxia, rising creatinine/oliguria, or signs of organ failure.
- If gallstone pancreatitis is confirmed, biliary consult/ERCP may be needed if there is ongoing cholangitis or biliary obstruction.

Prognosis and next steps
- Many cases resolve with conservative management in 3–7 days; others become severe and require longer care. Identifying and treating the underlying cause (e.g., cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis, triglyceride lowering if hypertriglyceridemia) will reduce recurrence.

Since the surgery, I have lost 15 kg, and my current BMI is 41 kg/m². I arrived at the Emergency Department experiencing profound nausea, diarrhea, and overall malaise. 

At the time of my visit, I was taking only vitamins as medication. My vital signs indicated a blood pressure of 84/40 mm Hg and a heart rate of 127 beats per minute, but I did not have a fever. During the examination, my abdomen was distended and tympanitic, with some diffuse tenderness noted. 

To further investigate my condition, an abdominal X-ray was performed without oral contrast. The results showed a diffusely dilated small bowel, but there appeared to be no obvious distal decompressed bowel or any abdominal free air.

Stricture,C,Bacterial overgrowth,neutral,"Most likely you have a small-bowel obstruction from an internal hernia (eg, Petersen or mesenteric defect) after Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass — probably a high‑grade/closed‑loop obstruction with possible strangulation.

Why:
- Timing fits: internal hernia is a well‑known complication weeks–months after RYGB as rapid weight loss reduces mesenteric fat and opens defects.  
- Symptoms (severe nausea, diarrhea, progressive abdominal distention, diffuse tenderness) and the x‑ray showing diffuse small‑bowel dilation without a decompressed distal segment fit a closed‑loop/obstructing lesion.  
- Hemodynamic instability (BP 84/40, HR 127) raises concern for strangulation, ischemia, or early sepsis.

What should happen next:
- This is urgent. If you are hemodynamically stable, an urgent contrast CT abdomen (look for a “mesenteric swirl,” transition point, bowel wall thickening/poor enhancement) is indicated.  
- If unstable or CT is unavailable/concern is high for strangulation, immediate surgical exploration is warranted.

138,"I am a 62-year-old woman and recently visited my primary care physician due to issues I have been experiencing with my legs. I find that I become easily tired when I walk, which has been quite frustrating. At times, I also experience pain and swelling in my legs, making it difficult to manage daily activities. 

My medical history includes obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a previous myocardial infarction. I have a significant smoking history, totaling 52 pack-years. I live at home with my husband, who helps me with daily tasks. Recently, I have had some episodes of falling, which has raised concerns for me. 

During my visit, my temperature was recorded at 99.5°F, and my blood pressure was notably high at 177/108 mmHg. My pulse was 90 beats per minute, and my respirations were 17 per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The exam revealed mild wheezes during the cardiopulmonary assessment and a murmur along the right sternal border. The doctor also inspected my lower extremities, which exhibited notable findings. Overall, I am seeking clarification on the best explanation for these symptoms and conditions I am facing.",A. Arterial insufficiency B. Decreased cardiac output C. Lymphatic insufficiency D. Trauma E. Venous valve dysfunction,E,Venous valve dysfunction,neutral,"Short answer: your leg symptoms most likely reflect peripheral arterial disease (PAD) — atherosclerotic narrowing of the leg arteries that causes exertional leg fatigue and pain (intermittent claudication). Your long smoking history, prior myocardial infarction, hypertension and hyperlipidemia strongly predispose to that. The leg swelling could be from chronic venous insufficiency or from heart-related fluid retention, and the new murmur plus falls/syncope raises concern for aortic-valve disease or other cardiac causes that need prompt evaluation.

Why I think this
- Intermittent leg tiredness/leg pain with walking in a patient with heavy smoking history and prior MI is classic for PAD (arterial insufficiency). PAD is part of systemic atherosclerosis.
- PAD signs on exam often include decreased/absent foot pulses, cool skin, hair loss, shiny skin, and pain that is relieved by rest.
- Leg swelling and aching that is worse at the end of the day is more typical of chronic venous insufficiency or lymphedema; pitting edema suggests venous/heart failure causes.
- A new murmur at the right sternal border and recent falls/syncope are worrying for clinically significant aortic stenosis or other cardiac dysfunction — needs echocardiography.

What to do next (recommended immediate steps)
1. Vascular testing:
   - Ankle–brachial index (ABI) to confirm PAD (quick, bedside test). If ABI is non-diagnostic (e.g., falsely high with vessel calcification), get toe pressures or arterial duplex.
   - Arterial duplex ultrasound for localization if PAD confirmed.
2. Cardiac evaluation:
   - Echocardiogram to assess the murmur and valve function (evaluate for aortic stenosis).
   - ECG and basic labs (BMP, CBC, lipid panel, BNP if concern for heart failure).
3. Rule out DVT if swelling is unilateral or acute (venous duplex).
4. Medication review and fall-risk assessment; check orthostatic vitals.

Initial treatment and risk-factor management
- Smoking cessation (most important single step to slow progression).
- Start/optimize high-intensity statin (given prior MI and PAD risk).
- Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) unless contraindicated.
- Supervised exercise therapy/walking program (improves claudication distance).
- Cilostazol can improve walking distance in PAD if no heart failure and after discussion with clinician.
- Control blood pressure and lipids; weight management and leg care.
- For leg swelling: elevation, compression stockings for venous insufficiency (only after ruling out severe arterial disease—don’t use compression if critical limb ischemia).
- Urgent cardiology referral if syncope or severe murmur.

When to seek urgent care
- New or worsening rest pain in a foot, nonhealing ulcers, skin discoloration, or signs of infection.
- Recurrent syncope, chest pain, or shortness of breath.

Talk with your PCP about ordering an ABI and an echocardiogram promptly, and getting referrals to vascular medicine/surgery and cardiology as indicated. If you want, tell me the specific lower-extremity exam findings (pulses, skin/color, ulceration, whether the swelling is pitting or unilateral) and I can be more specific.",Venous valve dysfunction,False,False,False,False,True
139,"I am a 52-year-old man who was taken to the emergency department due to severe discomfort in my upper abdomen and left-sided chest pain that radiated to my back. This pain began shortly after I woke up. Along with the pain, I experienced multiple episodes of vomiting. The day before, I had undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate ongoing epigastric pain.

I have a history of ischemic heart disease and had a coronary angioplasty three years ago. My family medical history includes my mother, who passed away from pancreatic cancer at the age of 60. At the time of my visit, I was taking several medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, ramipril, and rosuvastatin. 

I felt pale, anxious, and was sweating profusely. My vital signs showed a temperature of 37.9°C, a rapid pulse of 140 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg in my arms and 108/68 mm Hg in my legs. My oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. During the examination, the doctor noted an audible S4 heart sound and some crepitus in my chest. There was tenderness in my epigastric area. An ECG showed signs of sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T changes, and blood tests indicated a Troponin I level within the normal range.",A. Pneumothorax B. Acute pancreatitis C. Esophageal perforation D. Aortic dissection E. Acute myocardial infarction,C,Esophageal perforation,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) — a full‑thickness tear of the esophagus. This classically follows forceful vomiting and presents with sudden severe epigastric/left‑chest pain radiating to the back, subcutaneous crepitus (air in the soft tissues), fever/tachycardia and signs of developing mediastinitis. Your recent EGD and the vomiting make this the leading cause of your presentation.

Why this fits best
- Sudden pain after vomiting, chest/epigastric radiation to the back, and palpable/auscultatory crepitus are highly suggestive of esophageal rupture.
- Normal troponin and nonspecific ECG changes make an acute MI less likely.
- Aortic dissection remains a possible alternative (chest/back pain, BP differences), but the physical and historical clues (crepitus, vomiting, recent endoscopy) point more toward esophageal perforation.

Immediate steps that should be (or already be) taken in the ED
1. NPO (no oral intake).
2. Broad‑spectrum IV antibiotics that cover oral and GI flora (for example piperacillin‑tazobactam, or ceftriaxone + metronidazole; escalate to carbapenem if severe).
3. IV fluids, analgesia, and close hemodynamic monitoring; oxygen as needed.
4. Urgent thoracic surgery consultation (this frequently requires operative or endoscopic repair/drainage).
5. Urgent imaging to confirm and define the leak: CT chest and upper abdomen with oral water‑soluble contrast (and IV contrast) is preferred. If needed, a water‑soluble contrast esophagogram (gastrografin) can localize the leak; barium only if gastrografin is negative and clinical suspicion remains high.
6. If there is a pleural collection or pneumothorax, chest tube drainage may be required.
7. Discuss antiplatelet/anticoagulant management with cardiology and the surgical team before any procedures; urgent surgery may require stopping antiplatelet agents and planning for bleeding risk.

Complications to be aware of
- Rapid progression to mediastinitis, sepsis, empyema, and death if not treated promptly.

Bottom line
Your story is most consistent with an esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome), a life‑threatening emergency that requires immediate imaging, broad antibiotics, NPO status, and urgent surgical evaluation. If you are still in the ED, ask the team to prioritize CT with oral contrast and a thoracic surgery consult right away.",Acute pancreatitis,True,True,True,True,True

Viral infection from maxillary sinus,G,Bacterial infection from ethmoidal sinus,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: orbital (postseptal) cellulitis, probably secondary to sinusitis (and less likely from the recent dental work). 

Why this fits
- Proptosis, impaired vision, painful limitation of eye movements and eyelid warmth/tenderness indicate infection behind the orbital septum (orbital rather than preseptal cellulitis).  
- Fever, worsening headache and a recent two-week history of nasal congestion point to ethmoid or maxillary sinus infection spreading into the orbit.  
- Headache worse on leaning forward is typical of sinus pressure/plugging (bending increases sinus pressure and pain).

Important other possibilities (less likely): preseptal cellulitis (would not cause proptosis or painful eye movement), cavernous sinus thrombosis (can be similar but often causes cranial nerve deficits, severe systemic illness and more bilateral signs), orbital abscess (a complication of orbital cellulitis if pus collects).

What needs to happen now
- This is an emergency. You should be admitted and treated urgently.  
- Immediate steps: hospitalize, obtain ophthalmology and ENT consults, get urgent contrast CT or MRI of the orbits and sinuses to look for orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal or orbital abscess, and any intracranial extension.  
- Start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics right away (regimens cover Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, anaerobes and common gram-negatives) and adjust if culture results identify a specific bug.  
- If an abscess is present or vision is threatened, prompt surgical drainage (ENT or ophthalmic surgery) may be required.  
- Blood cultures and possibly sinus or orbital drainage cultures will guide therapy.

Why prompt treatment matters
- Orbital cellulitis can cause permanent vision loss and can spread to the cavernous sinus or brain. Rapid diagnosis and treatment greatly reduce those risks.

Why:
- You have a microcytic anemia (Hb 9.3 g/dL, MCV 71) but iron studies show iron overload (serum iron 210 µg/dL, ferritin 310 ng/mL, transferrin saturation 78%) — this pattern is classic for sideroblastic anemia (ineffective heme synthesis → iron trapped in marrow/mitochondria → high serum iron/ferritin and high transferrin saturation).
- Family history with affected males (brother and maternal uncle) strongly suggests X‑linked inheritance (ALAS2 mutation), which is the common hereditary form in adult men.
- Occasional alcohol use is a possible acquired contributor (alcohol can cause sideroblastic changes), but the family pattern points to a hereditary cause.

Recommended next steps:
- Do not start oral iron (will worsen iron overload).
- Confirm with bone marrow exam showing ring sideroblasts (Prussian blue stain) and/or genetic testing for ALAS2 mutation.
- Evaluate for reversible causes (lead, isoniazid, B6 deficiency, ongoing alcohol) and consider a trial of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) if hereditary X‑linked ALAS2 is suspected.
- Assess iron overload complications (liver, heart, endocrine) and consider hematology referral for management (chelation vs. other therapies) and family counseling/genetic testing.

What to do now (next steps)
- See a clinician promptly so they can collect a nasopharyngeal swab for Bordetella pertussis PCR and start treatment. Do not wait for test results to treat if pertussis is likely.
- Antibiotic treatment: azithromycin is first-line for a 4-year-old. Typical pediatric regimen: 10 mg/kg once on day 1, then 5 mg/kg once daily on days 2–5 (weight-based; clinician will calculate the exact dose). If macrolide allergy, an alternative is trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (if age ≥2 months).
- Household and close contacts should receive macrolide prophylaxis (including pregnant women and infants) — public-health action is important.

Infection control
- Keep the child away from school/daycare and avoid contact with infants or pregnant women until 5 days after starting appropriate antibiotics (or 21 days after cough onset if untreated).
- Pertussis is reportable; the clinician/public-health department will handle contact tracing.

Splenic abscess,E,Splenic abscess,neutral,"Most likely: infective endocarditis (IE) with septic embolization to the spleen (splenic infarct or splenic abscess).

Why this fits
- IV drug use predisposes to bloodstream infection and endocarditis.
- Fever + a new cardiac murmur strongly suggests IE.
- Left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain in the setting of IE suggests a septic embolus to the spleen causing infarct or abscess.
- Low blood pressure and tachycardia indicate sepsis/septic shock physiology — this is an emergency.

Immediate steps your team should take (what you can expect)
1. Stabilize: IV fluids and monitoring for shock; start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics promptly (do not delay if patient unstable).
2. Blood cultures: ideally obtain at least 2–3 sets from separate sites before antibiotics if you can safely wait a short time.
3. Empiric antibiotics: vancomycin is commonly started empirically to cover MRSA and typical IE organisms; regimens may be broadened based on local patterns and clinical judgment.
4. Imaging for the heart: transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is preferred to look for vegetations/valve damage (transthoracic echo first if TEE not immediately available).
5. Imaging for the abdomen: contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen (or abdominal ultrasound if CT not available) to evaluate for splenic infarct or abscess.
6. Labs: CBC, CMP, lactic acid, coagulation panel, and repeat vitals; consider admission to ICU if hemodynamically unstable.
7. Consults: Infectious diseases and cardiothoracic surgery (if large vegetations/valve dysfunction); general surgery/interventional radiology if splenic abscess requires drainage or splenectomy.

Usual causative bugs
- Staphylococcus aureus (most common in IV drug users), streptococci, enterococci. Therapy will be narrowed once cultures return.

Other possibilities (less likely given the murmur)
- Primary splenic pathology (abscess from other sources), splenic infarct from a noninfectious embolus, pancreatitis, pneumonia with referred LUQ pain — but the combination of fever + new murmur + IVDU makes IE with splenic embolus the priority diagnosis.

- Recurrent self‑harm used to regulate emotion or get care rather than to die.  
- Pattern of stormy relationships (broken up many times; “worst person in the world” then wanting care).  
- Rapid mood shifts (hours) and chronic emptiness.  
- Anger/outbursts and impulsive behavior.

Other possibilities your team will consider: bipolar disorder (usually mood episodes last days–weeks and meet criteria for mania/hypomania), major depression, PTSD, substance-related problems, or other personality patterns. The ED team and psychiatry will sort this out.

Immediate steps you can expect (and things that are important now)
- A focused suicide/safety assessment: current suicidal ideation, plan, intent, prior attempts, access to means. If there’s high imminent risk you may be admitted for safety.  
- Wound care and medical treatment for injuries.  
- If safe to discharge, removal of means (knives, pills), a written safety plan, and urgent outpatient follow-up or crisis resources. In the U.S. the 988 Lifeline can be called/texted for immediate support.

Treatment and longer‑term help
- Psychotherapy is the primary treatment. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has the strongest evidence for reducing self‑harm and emotional dysregulation. Mentalization‑based therapy, transference‑focused psychotherapy, and schema therapy are other options.  
- Medications don’t “fix” BPD itself but can help specific symptoms (e.g., SSRIs for mood/anxiety, mood stabilizers for impulsivity/affective lability, antipsychotics for severe anger or transient psychotic symptoms). These are tailored by a psychiatrist.  
- Building a crisis/safety plan, learning emotion‑regulation and interpersonal skills, and getting regular therapy can markedly improve functioning over time.

What I recommend now
- Be honest with the ED/psychiatry team about any suicidal thoughts, plans, or access to means — this helps them keep you safe.  
- If you aren’t currently safe at home or feel you might act on suicidal thoughts, request inpatient evaluation/admission.  
- Ask for an urgent referral to DBT or a clinician experienced with BPD, and for crisis resources before discharge.  
- If you want, I can help you draft questions to ask the psychiatrist/therapist or look up DBT programs in your area.

147,"I am a 9-year-old boy with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. My mother brought me to the clinic because I developed itchy vesicles on the left side of my torso about 12 hours prior to the visit. The day before the vesicles appeared, I had been complaining of a burning sensation in that same area. 

For the past month, I have been undergoing chemotherapy, which includes methotrexate, cytarabine, and cyclophosphamide. My most recent treatment was just two days ago. I have no other significant medical history and, at the time of the clinic visit, I did not have a fever, and my vital signs were normal.

During the examination, the doctor noted that the painful vesicles were localized to the left C7 skin dermatome. My symptoms and the location of the vesicles were discussed, leading to considerations about the possible cause of my skin lesions.",A. Viral infection of the skin B. Reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) due to congenital immunodeficiency C. Chickenpox D. Reactivation of VZV due to immunodeficiency caused by chemotherapy E. Bacterial infection of the skin,D,Reactivation of VZV due to immunodeficiency caused by chemotherapy,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: herpes zoster (shingles) from reactivation of varicella‑zoster virus. The burning pain followed a day later by grouped vesicles in a single dermatome (left C7) and the fact that he is immunosuppressed from recent chemotherapy strongly support this.

Why this matters
- Immunosuppression (chemotherapy) raises the risk of VZV reactivation and of more severe or widespread disease. Prompt antiviral treatment lowers the risk of complications.

Recommended next steps (what the clinic/hospital should do now)
1. Start antiviral therapy immediately — in an immunocompromised child this is typically intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours; duration usually 7–10 days, adjusted by the treating team). Discuss and confirm exact dosing with the pediatric oncology/infectious‑disease team.
2. Collect a sample from a fresh vesicle for VZV PCR (best test) to confirm the diagnosis. A Tzanck smear can show viral changes but is not specific.
3. Isolation precautions: airborne and contact precautions until lesions are crusted to prevent spread (especially to pregnant women, newborns, and other immunocompromised people).
4. Notify the oncology team immediately — they will decide whether admission, adjustment of chemo, or additional therapies are needed and will monitor for dissemination (new lesions outside the dermatome, fever, respiratory or neurologic signs).
5. Symptom control: pain management (age‑appropriate analgesics; avoid aspirin) and wound care. Discuss options for neuropathic pain if needed with specialists.
6. Watch for signs of worsening (fever, many new lesions beyond the dermatome, breathing or neurologic symptoms) — these require urgent evaluation.

Other considerations
- Differential diagnoses (less likely given the presentation) include herpes simplex or other vesicular rashes, but the dermatomal distribution and prodromal burning are classic for zoster.
- In some high‑risk patients, antiviral prophylaxis is used during chemotherapy — this would be discussed by his oncology team going forward.

148,"I am a 49-year-old man who has generally been in good health. Recently, I began experiencing worsening headaches that persisted for about a month. Alongside the headaches, I noticed an increase in my irritability. Concerned about these symptoms, I decided to visit my physician for an examination.

During the visit, the doctor conducted a thorough examination and noted bilateral papilledema in my eyes. To investigate further, I underwent an MRI of my brain. The results showed a mass located in the right temporal lobe, characterized by heterogeneous peripheral rim enhancement that crossed the midline.

Following the diagnosis, I was scheduled for a surgical resection of the mass. The surgery took place successfully, and the gross examination of the mass revealed it to be poorly demarcated, with visible areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. I am now awaiting the microscopic examination results of the mass to understand more about its nature and implications for my health.",A. Spindle cells with hypercellular and hypocellular regions B. Closely-packed capillaries and foamy stromal cells C. Pleomorphic cells forming pseudopalisades D. Cells with clear cytoplasm and central round nuclei E. Small blue cells arranged in rosettes F. Areas of lamellated calcification,C,Pleomorphic cells forming pseudopalisades,neutral,"Given your age, clinical course (rapidly progressive headaches, papilledema), imaging (right temporal, heterogeneously rim-enhancing mass that crosses the midline) and the gross description (poorly demarcated with hemorrhage and necrosis), the most likely diagnosis is glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme, WHO grade IV), most often the primary (IDH‑wildtype) form in adults.

What the pathologist will likely report microscopically
- Highly cellular, infiltrative astrocytic tumor with marked nuclear pleomorphism and atypia.  
- Frequent mitotic figures.  
- Necrosis with pseudopalisading of tumor cells around necrotic foci (a characteristic feature).  
- Microvascular proliferation / endothelial proliferation.  
- High proliferative index (Ki‑67/MIB‑1).  
- Tumor cells usually express GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), confirming glial origin.

Typical molecular tests and why they matter
- IDH1/IDH2 mutation status: most primary GBMs are IDH‑wildtype; IDH‑mutant GBMs (less common in older adults) have a better prognosis.  
- MGMT promoter methylation: predicts better response to temozolomide chemotherapy.  
- Other common alterations (often reported): EGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation, combined chromosome 7 gain/10 loss — these support the diagnosis and prognosis.

Next steps and prognosis
- Standard management after maximal safe resection is concurrent radiotherapy with temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide (Stupp protocol).  
- Prognosis is guarded; median survival for glioblastoma with current standard therapy is on the order of about 12–18 months, but individual outcomes vary and MGMT methylation/IDH status influence prognosis.  
- You should expect a formal pathology report within a few days that includes the microscopic description and molecular test results; discuss those results and adjuvant treatment options with your neurosurgeon and neuro‑oncology team.

149,"I am a 39-year-old woman with a history of migraine headaches. Recently, I experienced a sudden and severe throbbing headache that began an hour before I arrived at the emergency room. Alongside the headache, I noticed that I was also experiencing double vision. 

In the weeks leading up to this event, I had been having frequent headaches and realized that I hadn’t had my period for several months. Upon arrival at the hospital, my blood pressure was recorded at 93/61 mm Hg. During the visual field testing, it was noted that I had decreased visual acuity and a loss of peripheral vision in both eyes. 

The combination of these symptoms prompted further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.",A. Transient ischemic attack B. Pituitary apoplexy C. Sheehan syndrome D. Migraine with aura E. Subarachnoid hemorrhage F. Cluster headache,B,Pituitary apoplexy,neutral,"This presentation is most consistent with pituitary apoplexy — sudden hemorrhage or infarction of a pituitary adenoma.

Why this fits
- Acute severe (“worst”) headache and diplopia are classic for apoplexy.
- Bitemporal peripheral visual field loss = compression of the optic chiasm by an enlarging pituitary mass.
- Months of amenorrhea beforehand suggest a preexisting pituitary adenoma (eg, prolactinoma or nonfunctioning adenoma).
- Low BP can reflect acute secondary adrenal insufficiency from loss of ACTH production.

Immediate next steps (urgent)
1. Treat presumptively for adrenal crisis: IV glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone bolus 100 mg IV, then intermittent dosing or infusion) and IV fluids while workup proceeds. Do not give thyroid hormone before steroids if central adrenal insufficiency is possible.
2. Urgent MRI pituitary/sellar protocol (CT if MRI not immediately available) to confirm hemorrhage/enlargement.
3. STAT labs: serum cortisol and ACTH, TSH and free T4, prolactin, LH/FSH, basic metabolic panel (sodium), glucose.
4. Neurosurgery and endocrine consultations promptly — transsphenoidal decompression is often needed for progressive visual loss or neurologic deterioration.
5. Ophthalmology/visual field testing and ongoing hemodynamic support as needed.

Prognosis
- With rapid steroids and appropriate neurosurgical/endocrine care, vision and ophthalmoplegia often improve. Long-term pituitary hormone deficiencies are common and may require lifelong replacement.

If this is happening now or very recently, make sure ED staff know you may have pituitary apoplexy so steroids, urgent MRI, and neurosurgical consult are started immediately.",Transient ischemic attack,True,True,True,True,True
150,"I am a 12-year-old African American boy who experienced a severe and painful penile erection for about five hours. This incident occurred while I was attending class at school when my penis suddenly became erect without any obvious reason. 

After the pain became unbearable, my parents took me to the emergency room for evaluation. The medical team conducted several tests to understand what was happening. They performed a complete blood count and a cavernous blood gas analysis. 

During my time in the ER, I was in significant discomfort, and the doctors decided to use an aspiration technique to relieve the pressure and pain. They also administered an adrenergic agonist along with pain relief medication. Fortunately, this approach was effective, and I experienced rapid detumescence.

The medical staff discussed various potential causes for my condition, considering my age and the nature of the symptoms. While I was able to express my discomfort, the focus was on diagnosing the underlying issue to prevent any future occurrences. The entire experience was quite alarming, but I was relieved when the treatment began to work.",A. Sickle cell disease (SCD) B. Glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency C. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) D. Hereditary spherocytosis E. Thalassemia,A,Sickle cell disease (SCD),neutral,"What you described is called priapism — a painful, unwanted erection that doesn’t go away after a normal period. Based on how it happened and the tests/treatment you had, this was most likely ischemic (low‑flow) priapism, which is the painful kind and a medical emergency.

Why the doctors did what they did
- Cavernous blood gas: this checks the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels inside the penis. In ischemic priapism the blood is low in oxygen, high in CO2, and acidic.  
- Aspiration and irrigation: removing blood from the penis relieves pressure and pain.  
- Adrenergic agonist (most often phenylephrine): this medicine helps the blood vessels squeeze down so normal blood flow returns.  
Those steps are the standard, correct emergency treatment and it’s good that they worked quickly for you.

Common causes, especially in someone your age
- Sickle cell disease is the most common cause in boys of African descent.  
- Other causes can include blood disorders, some medicines or drugs, or rarely trauma.  
If you don’t already know your sickle cell status, your doctors will likely want to check for it (hemoglobin electrophoresis) and may do more blood tests or refer you to a hematologist.

What to expect next and follow‑up
- Because it was treated after about five hours, the chance of full recovery is good, but follow-up is important.  
- You should see a urologist and possibly a hematologist to find the cause and to make a plan to prevent recurrence.  
- If priapism lasts much longer (generally over 24 hours) there is a higher risk of permanent damage to erectile tissue; quick treatment lowers that risk.  
- If you ever have another erection that is painful and lasts more than 3–4 hours, go to the ER right away.

If you want, tell me whether you already know if you have sickle cell disease or trait, and whether the ER gave you any lab numbers (like the blood gas results).

I have a history of type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Three years ago, I was involved in a motor vehicle collision, but I haven't had any significant issues since then. My current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, enalapril, atorvastatin, and aspirin.

In terms of my sexual history, I have had seven partners throughout my life, and I have used condoms inconsistently. During my examination, I was oriented to time, place, and person, and my vital signs were within normal limits. The doctor noted that my pupils were equal and reactive to light.

When examining my upper extremities, the doctor found decreased muscle strength, absent reflexes, and a weakened hand grip, accompanied by fasciculations in both arms. Sensation to temperature and pain was absent over my chest and the upper arms, though I could still feel vibration and joint position in my upper limbs.

Subacute combined degeneration G. Syringomyelia,G,Syringomyelia,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: syringomyelia (a cervical spinal cord syrinx), probably post‑traumatic given your remote motor vehicle collision.

Why: your pattern — loss of pain and temperature over the chest/upper arms in a “cape‑like” distribution with preservation of vibration/position sense, plus progressive bilateral hand weakness, absent upper‑extremity reflexes and fasciculations — is classic for a fluid‑filled cavity in the central spinal cord. A syrinx damages the crossing spinothalamic fibers in the anterior commissure (explaining bilateral pain/temp loss) and the anterior horn cells (explaining LMN signs, atrophy, fasciculations, and weakness). Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, cervical radiculopathy, or ALS are less consistent with this exact sensory pattern and combination of signs.

Recommended next steps
- Urgent MRI of the cervical (and thoracic) spine with attention to syrinx; MRI brain if concern for Chiari malformation.  
- Neurosurgery referral if a syrinx is confirmed (treatment options include shunting or addressing an underlying lesion).  
- EMG/NCS if there is uncertainty or to document anterior horn vs peripheral nerve involvement.

Anti-nuclear antibodies E. Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies,E,Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies,neutral,"Your combination of hemoptysis, bilateral pulmonary consolidation, RBC casts on urinalysis, and oliguria (400 mL/24 h) strongly suggests a pulmonary–renal syndrome (simultaneous lung hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis). The two highest‑priority considerations are:

- Anti‑GBM (Goodpasture) disease — classically causes alveolar hemorrhage (hemoptysis) plus rapidly progressive GN with RBC casts and oliguria. Renal biopsy shows linear IgG deposition along the GBM. Anti‑GBM antibody testing is diagnostic.
- ANCA‑associated vasculitides (granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis) — can present similarly (pulmonary hemorrhage + pauci‑immune crescentic GN). Test with ANCA (c‑ANCA/PR3, p‑ANCA/MPO).

Other less likely causes: severe SLE (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage + lupus nephritis), infective endocarditis with immune complex GN, cryoglobulinemia or other vasculitides, or drug/toxin‑induced causes.

What should be done urgently
- Admit and consult nephrology and pulmonology immediately.
- Urgent labs: serum creatinine/BUN, electrolytes, CBC, coagulation profile, blood type & crossmatch, urinalysis with microscopy (already RBC casts), urine protein quantification.
- Specific serologies: anti‑GBM antibodies, ANCA (PR3, MPO), ANA/anti‑dsDNA, complement levels. Blood and sputum cultures if infection suspected.
- Imaging/diagnostics: chest CT for better lung detail; consider bronchoscopy with BAL if alveolar hemorrhage uncertain or to exclude infection.
- Renal biopsy (urgent) to establish type of GN if safe and feasible.
- Empiric, time‑sensitive treatment if clinical suspicion is high: high‑dose IV corticosteroids and prompt immunosuppression (nephrology guidance). If anti‑GBM is likely/confirmed, plasmapheresis is indicated urgently to remove circulating antibodies. For ANCA vasculitis, cyclophosphamide or rituximab plus steroids is standard.
- Avoid anticoagulation unless absolutely required and infection should be excluded before heavy immunosuppression.

Bottom line: This presentation is an emergency typical of anti‑GBM disease or ANCA‑associated pulmonary‑renal syndrome.

This tingling occurs in a glove and stocking pattern and is sometimes accompanied by a burning sensation.

Additionally, I have had 2 to 3 episodes of non-bloody diarrhea each month, which are associated with crampy abdominal pain. My past medical history is unremarkable, and I do not smoke, consume alcohol, or use illicit drugs.

A blood test revealed low hemoglobin levels and a high mean corpuscular volume, along with other notable findings. A peripheral blood smear indicated hypersegmented neutrophils. I also underwent an upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through, which showed a narrowing in the terminal ileum.

Bacterial overgrowth E. Hypothyroidism,C,Crohn's disease,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: Crohn disease with terminal-ileal involvement causing vitamin B12 malabsorption → vitamin B12 deficiency (megaloblastic anemia) and peripheral neuropathy.

Why this fits
- Macrocytic anemia with hypersegmented neutrophils = megaloblastic anemia (classically B12 or folate deficiency).  
- Neurologic symptoms (glove-and-stocking paresthesias, burning) are typical of B12 deficiency.  
- Narrowing of the terminal ileum on small-bowel study strongly suggests Crohn disease; the terminal ileum is where B12–intrinsic factor complexes are absorbed, so ileal disease causes B12 malabsorption.  
- Intermittent nonbloody diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain are common Crohn features.

Recommended next steps
1. Urgently check serum B12, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (MMA is most specific for B12 deficiency).  
2. Start B12 replacement without delay if clinically suspected (intramuscular cyanocobalamin/hydroxocobalamin is typical) to reduce risk of irreversible neurologic damage.  
3. Refer to gastroenterology for colonoscopy with ileoscopy and biopsy to confirm Crohn disease, and further workup (CRP/ESR, fecal calprotectin, stool studies as indicated).  
4. Evaluate for other nutritional deficiencies (folate, iron) and consider imaging/endoscopic therapy and Crohn-directed treatment (steroids, immunomodulators, biologics) based on severity.  
5. Consider testing for anti–intrinsic factor/parietal cell antibodies only if ileal disease is absent or if the picture remains unclear.

Duodenal peptic ulcer,B,Gallbladder cancer,neutral,"You are right to be thinking about biliary and pancreatic causes given your history of gallstones, the severe epigastric/upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea/vomiting, and a calcified mass seen near the gallbladder on CT. Key diagnoses that should be considered and actively excluded are:

Most likely / urgent to exclude
- Gallstone pancreatitis — classically causes severe epigastric pain that radiates to the back with nausea/vomiting. Check serum lipase (best test). If elevated, treat as pancreatitis (NPO, IV fluids, pain control) and evaluate for gallstone etiology.
- Acute cholecystitis (acute inflammation of the gallbladder) — may be subtle on exam; ultrasound and HIDA scan help confirm. If present, often needs early surgical treatment.
- Choledocholithiasis / ascending cholangitis — stones in the common bile duct can cause obstructive LFT pattern and, if infected, cause fever, jaundice, hypotension/altered mental status (Reynolds’ pentad). Check LFTs, bilirubin; if suspected, MRCP or ERCP may be needed.

Findings on CT to clarify
- “Calcified mass near the gallbladder” may represent a calcified gallstone or a calcified gallbladder wall (porcelain gallbladder). Porcelain gallbladder is associated with chronic cholecystitis and has a higher long-term risk of gallbladder cancer, so it is generally an indication for cholecystectomy in a reasonable surgical candidate.
- Less commonly the calcification could be a calcified lymph node, hepatic calcification, or other benign calcifications; further imaging helps characterize it.

Recommended next steps / tests
- Serum lipase (rule out pancreatitis)
- Liver tests (AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin) and CBC, CMP
- Right upper quadrant ultrasound (better for gallstones and gallbladder wall assessment)
- If ultrasound is equivocal for acute cholecystitis: HIDA scan
- If common bile duct stone is suspected or LFTs are obstructive: MRCP or ERCP (therapeutic)
- If porcelain gallbladder or concern for malignancy on imaging: surgical referral and consideration of contrast-enhanced CT or MRI and hepatobiliary surgical evaluation

Management implications
- If pancreatitis: admit, supportive care; if gallstone-related, cholecystectomy is often done during the same hospitalization or shortly after recovery.
- If acute cholecystitis: antibiotics and early cholecystectomy in most patients.
- If porcelain gallbladder seen on imaging: elective cholecystectomy is usually recommended because of malignancy risk (discuss options with a surgeon).
- If imaging suggests cancer: referral to hepatobiliary surgery/oncology for staging and management.

When to seek emergency care now
- New/worsening fever, jaundice, increasing or unremitting pain, lightheadedness, or inability to keep fluids down — go to the emergency department.

Metastatic lung disease,D,Small cell lung cancer,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung (a centrally located bronchogenic carcinoma) causing bronchial obstruction with recurrent post‑obstructive pneumonia and a malignant pleural effusion (which makes this metastatic/Stage IV disease).

Why this fits:
- Long smoking history and age increase lung cancer risk.  
- Recurrent pneumonia in the same right lower lobe suggests airway obstruction by a central tumor.  
- CT shows a hilar mass (typical location for squamous cell or small‑cell, squamous is most classically associated with smoking and post‑obstructive infection).  
- Malignant cells in pleural fluid indicate pleural involvement (M1a).

Recommended next steps:
- Obtain tissue diagnosis and histologic subtype (bronchoscopic biopsy of the hilar lesion or CT‑guided biopsy if peripheral components). Pleural biopsy can also help if pleural cytology is nondiagnostic.  
- Staging with PET‑CT and brain MRI to guide therapy.

I have a history of hypertension and have not been compliant with my medication regimen. Currently, I take methyldopa, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Upon examination, my pulse was recorded at 90 beats per minute, my respirations at 16 breaths per minute, and my blood pressure was 145 over 90. The physician noted that my abdomen was tender, and I was experiencing hypertonic contractions. There was visible blood on the vulva, around the introitus, and on the medial aspect of both thighs. 

The fetus was found to be in a breech presentation, and the fetal heart rate was elevated at 180 beats per minute, with recurrent decelerations observed. The medical team assessed my condition and the potential causes of fetal compromise based on these findings.",A. Rupture of the uterus B. Placental tissue covering the cervical os C. Rupture of aberrant fetal vessels D. Abnormal position of the fetus E. Detachment of the placenta,E,Detachment of the placenta,neutral,"Summary diagnosis — most likely placental abruption (abruptio placentae) causing uteroplacental insufficiency and acute fetal compromise.

Why this fits
- Risk factors present: untreated/poorly controlled hypertension is a major risk factor for abruption.  
- Classic findings: sudden onset abdominal pain, a tender/board‑like hypertonic uterus, and dark vaginal bleeding are typical for abruption (vs placenta previa which is usually painless, bright red bleeding).  
- Fetal signs: persistent fetal tachycardia (180 bpm) with recurrent decelerations indicates significant fetal distress from acute uteroplacental bleeding/insufficiency.  
- Concealed hemorrhage is common in abruption and can explain blood seen on the vulva/thighs while the uterus is tense and tender.

Other considerations (differential)
- Uterine rupture (higher risk because of prior cesarean): can present with severe pain, abnormal fetal heart tracings and bleeding — less classic here but must be considered, especially if sudden loss of station, cessation of contractions, or maternal instability.  
- Umbilical cord prolapse or compression can cause recurrent decelerations, particularly with malpresentation (breech), but usually occurs with membrane rupture and produces sudden profound variable decelerations; it does not explain a tense, tender uterus.  
- Infection (chorioamnionitis) can cause fetal tachycardia but usually has fever, maternal tachycardia and no acute uterine tenderness/hypertonus.

Immediate management priorities (what the team should do now)
- Call obstetrics/OR and neonatal team immediately — this is an obstetric emergency.  
- Maternal stabilization: two large‑bore IV lines, type & crossmatch, full blood count, coagulation studies, and urgent blood products available.  
- Continuous fetal monitoring and close maternal vital sign monitoring. Place patient in left lateral tilt, give oxygen if fetal distress severe, and treat severe hypertension acutely (IV labetalol or hydralazine per local protocol).  
- Prepare for urgent delivery — with prior lower segment cesarean, breech presentation and ongoing fetal compromise, emergency cesarean delivery is the usual course. If uterine rupture is suspected, immediate laparotomy.  
- Avoid tocolysis. If coagulopathy or heavy hemorrhage develops, treat with blood products and correct DIC as needed. Neonatal resuscitation team should be present at delivery.

Bottom line: the most likely cause of the fetal distress in your case is placental abruption related to poorly controlled hypertension; urgent stabilization and expedited delivery (most likely emergency cesarean) are required.

157,"I arrived at the emergency department after experiencing severe lower chest pain that had persisted for the past hour. The pain radiated to my back and was accompanied by nausea. Since the onset of the pain, I had vomited twice, though the vomit was non-bloody.

I have a medical history that includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, I have been a smoker for 30 years, consuming one pack of cigarettes daily. My alcohol intake is around five to six beers per day. At the time of my visit, I was taking enalapril and metformin as part of my treatment.

Upon examination, I was noted to have a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F), a pulse of 110 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was measured at 90/60 mm Hg. The examination revealed clear lungs, but my abdomen was distended with tenderness and guarding in the epigastric region—though there was no rebound tenderness. My bowel sounds were decreased.

The medical staff conducted several assessments, including an ECG, which indicated sinus tachycardia. I was concerned about what might be causing my symptoms and awaited further evaluation and diagnosis.",A. Acute mesenteric ischemia B. Boerhaave syndrome C. Aortic dissection D. Peptic ulcer disease E. Pericarditis F. Myocardial infarction G. Acute pancreatitis,G,Acute pancreatitis,neutral,"What this most likely is
- Your story (sudden severe epigastric/lower chest pain radiating to the back, nausea/vomiting, alcohol use, fever, abdominal distention/tenderness with decreased bowel sounds, hypotension and tachycardia) is most consistent with acute pancreatitis — very likely alcohol-related. The classic features are severe epigastric pain radiating to the back plus vomiting and abdominal tenderness. The fever, low blood pressure and tachycardia are concerning for a severe attack and systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) or evolving shock.

Why it isn’t certain yet
- Confirmation requires testing (see below). Other causes to consider and exclude early are myocardial ischemia, perforated viscus, pulmonary embolus or aortic pathology, so the team will usually check troponin, chest X‑ray/ECG (you had ECG), and other tests as indicated.

What I’d expect the ED to do next (immediate priorities)
1. Diagnostic tests
   - Serum lipase (and/or amylase) — lipase >3× upper limit strongly supports pancreatitis.
   - Basic labs: CBC, electrolytes, BUN/creatinine, glucose, liver tests, calcium, serum triglycerides, lactate.
   - Cardiac troponin (to exclude myocardial ischemia given chest pain and hypotension).
   - Blood cultures only if febrile and suspected infection.
   - Abdominal ultrasound (RUQ) to look for gallstones/biliary obstruction.
   - Contrast CT abdomen only if diagnosis is uncertain or to assess severity/complications.

2. Supportive treatment (start immediately)
   - NPO (nothing by mouth).
   - Aggressive IV fluids (isotonic crystalloid). Initial bolus then frequent reassessment — patients with hypotension often need prompt resuscitation and ICU-level monitoring.
   - Analgesia (IV opioids as needed).
   - Antiemetics for nausea/vomiting.
   - Oxygen if hypoxic; monitor urine output and vital signs frequently.
   - Hold metformin while hypotensive/if renal function is impaired (risk of lactic acidosis).
   - Temporarily hold ACE inhibitor if hypotension persists; address blood pressure once fluids given.

3. Disposition and escalation
   - Because of hypotension and tachycardia plus fever, the ED may transfer you to an ICU or high-dependency unit for close monitoring, aggressive fluids, and possible vasopressors if blood pressure does not respond.
   - If gallstone pancreatitis with signs of cholangitis or biliary obstruction, urgent ERCP may be required.
   - If triglycerides are very high (>1000 mg/dL), specific therapy (insulin/plasmapheresis) may be needed.
   - Antibiotics are not given routinely for acute pancreatitis unless there is documented infected necrosis or another clear source of infection.

Potential complications to watch for
- Pancreatic necrosis/infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, shock, pseudocyst formation, and persistent organ failure.

What you should know now
- The ED should be working on the blood tests and imaging now and treating you with fluids, pain control, and monitoring. The final diagnosis will depend largely on the lipase level and imaging. Given your alcohol history and the exam, pancreatitis is the leading possibility and needs prompt, aggressive management.

For the past week, I have been experiencing nausea and occasional vomiting. Additionally, I have had a fever and left-sided headaches for the past two weeks, along with increasing tooth pain over the last three weeks. 

When I got to the hospital, I was in moderate distress. The medical staff noted that my temperature was high, and my heart rate was elevated. I was confused and could only recognize people, not where I was. They observed that my pupils reacted slowly to light. During the examination, they found signs of swelling in my optic nerves. Although my eye movements were normal, they noticed that bending my neck caused flexion in my hips. The doctors were trying to determine what was causing these symptoms and what my diagnosis might be.",A. Viral meningitis B. Medulloblastoma C. Subarachnoid hemorrhage D. HSV encephalitis E. Pyogenic brain abscess F. Cavernous sinus thrombosis,E,Pyogenic brain abscess,neutral,"Most likely you have a brain abscess (a pocket of infection in the brain) that developed from your infected tooth. The story fits: weeks of tooth pain followed by left-sided headache, fever and nausea for days to weeks, then sudden worsening with severe headache and confusion. The swollen optic nerves (papilledema) mean raised pressure inside your head, and bending your neck causing your hips to flex is a sign of meningeal irritation (like meningitis can cause) — both can occur when an abscess or other infection spreads in the skull.

Why this is most likely:
- Dental infections can spread directly or through the blood to the brain.
- A brain abscess often causes a gradually worsening headache, fever, vomiting, altered mental status and signs of raised intracranial pressure.
- Eye movements being preserved makes a cavernous sinus thrombosis less likely, while the positive meningeal sign and papilledema point to an intracranial space‑occupying infection.

What should happen next (urgent steps):
- Immediate brain imaging (contrast CT or MRI) to look for an abscess or subdural empyema.
- Do NOT have a lumbar puncture until imaging shows it is safe (because high intracranial pressure can make LP dangerous).
- Start broad‑spectrum IV antibiotics that cover oral bacteria and anaerobes (and add MRSA coverage if needed) and get neurosurgery involved for possible drainage.

A physical examination revealed diffuse petechiae and bruising on my skin.",A. Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection B. Hepatitis B infection C. Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency D. Vitamin D deficiency E. Vitamin K deficiency,E,Vitamin K deficiency,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Vitamin K–deficiency bleeding (hemorrhagic disease of the newborn), most consistent with late VKDB (age 2–12 weeks) from lack of prophylactic vitamin K after a home birth.

Why
- Newborns have low vitamin K stores and breast milk contains little vitamin K. Without prophylaxis at birth they are at risk for bleeding from deficiency of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X). Presentation can include poor feeding, lethargy, hypotension and widespread bleeding/bruising; intracranial hemorrhage is common in late VKDB.

Key diagnostic clues and labs
- Prolonged PT/INR (often the earliest abnormality, because factor VII has the shortest half‑life). PTT may be prolonged later. Platelet count and fibrinogen are usually normal (helps distinguish from DIC or thrombocytopenic causes of petechiae). Administering vitamin K corrects the coagulopathy over hours.

Immediate management
1. Stabilize (airway, breathing, circulation).  
2. Obtain labs: CBC, PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, blood type/crossmatch; consider blood cultures if sepsis possible.  
3. Give vitamin K (phytonadione) promptly (neonatal treatment dose commonly 1–2 mg; route depends on situation — IV slow or IM).  
4. For severe bleeding/shock or intracranial hemorrhage: give blood products (FFP or prothrombin-complex concentrate) to correct clotting factors immediately while vitamin K takes effect, and consider neurosurgical/neuroradiologic evaluation (head CT/MRI).  
5. If platelet count is low, give platelets as indicated.

As part of the evaluation, I underwent an HIV screening test, which returned positive. Following this, further laboratory studies revealed that my CD4+ count was 650/mm3. Based on this information, my healthcare provider discussed my condition with me, indicating that I am likely in an early stage of HIV infection. 

I appreciate the thoroughness of the examination and the clarity during our discussion about my health.",A. Latent HIV infection B. Chronic HIV infection C. AIDS D. Acute HIV infection E. Asymptomatic HIV infection,D,Acute HIV infection,neutral,"Thanks — and good that you sought care early. Briefly, here’s what your results likely mean and the usual next steps.

What this means
- A positive screening test needs confirmatory testing (most clinics do a 4th‑generation antigen/antibody test followed by an HIV‑1/HIV‑2 differentiation assay and, if needed, an HIV RNA test).  
- A CD4+ count of 650 cells/mm3 is within the normal/near‑normal range (normal roughly 500–1,500), so you are not immunosuppressed and do not have AIDS. Your symptoms are consistent with acute (early) HIV infection, which commonly causes fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy and diarrhea a few weeks after exposure.

Important next steps your clinic will likely do or discuss
- Confirmatory testing (if not already done).  
- Baseline labs: HIV viral load (RNA), genotype/resistance testing, CBC, CMP, fasting lipids/glucose, hepatitis B and C serologies, syphilis and other STI screening, and TB screening.  
- Tests that guide treatment choice: HLA‑B*5701 (if abacavir may be considered) and pregnancy test if relevant.  
- Start antiretroviral therapy (ART). Current guidelines recommend offering ART immediately regardless of CD4 count because it protects your immune system and rapidly reduces infectiousness (U=U: undetectable = untransmittable). Many clinics use a same‑day “test and treat” approach.  
- Counseling about transmission: avoid condomless sex or needle sharing until your viral load is suppressed; notify partners so they can be tested (health departments can assist with partner services). Consider PrEP for HIV‑negative partners.  
- Vaccinations as appropriate (influenza, Tdap, HPV if indicated, hepatitis B vaccine if susceptible, etc.).

What to expect on treatment
- Viral load usually falls quickly and is typically undetectable by ~3 months for most people on effective ART. Your provider will recheck viral load and CD4 at about 4–8 weeks after starting ART and then every 3–6 months until stable.  
- With early diagnosis and consistent treatment, long‑term prognosis is excellent and life expectancy approaches that of people without HIV.

If you want, I can:
- Help you draft questions to ask your provider about ART options and side effects.  
- Explain common first‑line ART regimens and what to expect.

I have a history of hypertension, which I have managed for 25 years, and I have been living with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 30 years. Additionally, I have been a smoker for 45 years, consuming 30 to 40 cigarettes daily. 

During the examination, the medical staff noted that the pulses in my femoral, popliteal, and dorsalis pedis arteries were diminished but still detectable on both sides. This examination helped the healthcare team assess my condition more thoroughly.",A. Critical limb ischemia B. Venous ulcer C. Raynaud’s phenomenon D. Pseudogout E. Cellulitis,A,Critical limb ischemia,neutral,"Your history and exam are most consistent with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with ischemic rest pain — in other words, chronic limb ischemia that may be progressing to critical limb ischemia.

Why:
- Rest pain that worsens with walking and improves when the foot is dangled (dependent) is a classic arterial/ischemic pattern (arterial pain is worse with elevation, better when limb is dependent).
- Longstanding diabetes, long heavy smoking history and long hypertension are strong risk factors for PAD.
- Diminished femoral, popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses on exam support an arterial blood‑flow problem.

Why this matters:
- Ischemic rest pain often indicates advanced disease and puts the limb at risk of nonhealing ulcers, infection and ultimately amputation unless revascularization or other treatment is undertaken.

Recommended next steps (urgent):
1. Urgent referral to a vascular specialist (vascular surgery or interventional radiology/angiology). This is time‑sensitive.
2. Objective testing:
   - Ankle‑brachial index (ABI) and arterial duplex ultrasound as initial noninvasive tests.
   - Cross‑sectional arterial imaging (CT angiography or MR angiography, or invasive angiography) for treatment planning.
3. If critical limb ischemia is suspected, hospital admission and expedited revascularization (endovascular angioplasty/stenting or surgical bypass) is often needed.
4. Medical management to start now:
   - Begin antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) if not already taking it (confirm with your doctor).
   - Start a high‑intensity statin (if not already on one).
   - Tight glycemic and blood‑pressure control.
   - Strongly and immediately stop smoking (cessation greatly affects outcomes).
   - Pain control and careful foot care; avoid walking on painful limb if advised.
5. Monitor for complications: new or worsening ulcers, gangrene, signs of infection, loss of sensation — seek immediate care if these occur.

During transportation to the hospital, I suffered a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which was treated with intravenous diazepam. My blood pressure was high, and they managed this with nitroglycerin. Once at the hospital, the medical team inserted a nasogastric tube for gastric lavage, and I was administered activated charcoal.

The situation was critical, but the medical team responded effectively to my condition.",A. Cocaine B. MPTP C. PCP D. Opioid E. Marijuana,A,Cocaine,neutral,"Based on the signs you describe, the picture is most consistent with an acute sympathomimetic stimulant intoxication (for example cocaine, amphetamines/MDMA). Reasoning in brief:
- Dilated pupils, high blood pressure and fever fit a sympathomimetic toxidrome.
- A generalized tonic‑clonic seizure and prolonged muscle activity explain the markedly raised creatine kinase (rhabdomyolysis).
- Low serum bicarbonate reflects metabolic acidosis from seizure-related lactic acid and from muscle breakdown.
- GCS 3 indicates a very depressed level of consciousness (postictal coma or central nervous system depression after overdose), and the emergency treatments you received (IV benzodiazepine for seizure, gastric decontamination/charcoal, BP control) were appropriate initial measures.

Important consequences they would watch for and typical next steps
- Monitor serial CK, creatinine and electrolytes; aggressive IV fluids to prevent/treat acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis.
- Continuous cardiac monitoring and ECG (stimulants can cause arrhythmias).
- Cooling and supportive measures for hyperthermia; monitor for coagulopathy, compartment syndrome, and respiratory complications (aspiration pneumonia).
- Toxicology testing (blood/urine) to identify the agent; repeated neurologic assessments.

Further discussions with my physician revealed I was experiencing some cognitive difficulties.

Acute myelogenous leukemia C. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia D. Chronic myelogenous leukemia E. Hairy cell leukemia,D,Chronic myelogenous leukemia,neutral,"The findings are most consistent with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative neoplasm driven by the Philadelphia chromosome (t[9;22] → BCR-ABL fusion).

Why this fits
- Philadelphia chromosome/BCR-ABL is the molecular hallmark of CML (it can also appear in some ALL cases but the clinical picture here favors CML).  
- Marked leukocytosis, elevated LDH and uric acid fit high cell turnover/proliferation.  
- Elevated B12 is common in myeloproliferative disorders because of increased binding proteins and marrow activity.  
- Constitutional symptoms (weight loss, cognitive symptoms, pallor) and hypoxia/low O2 saturation can occur with high WBC counts or disease progression.

What should happen next
- Urgent hematology/oncology evaluation.  
- Confirmation and staging: peripheral blood smear, quantitative BCR‑ABL PCR, bone marrow biopsy/cytogenetics.  
- Immediate management decisions depend on severity: if there is hyperleukocytosis with leukostasis (severe dyspnea, hypoxia, neurologic symptoms), emergent cytoreduction (hydroxyurea and/or leukapheresis) may be needed.  
- Definitive therapy is with BCR‑ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, etc.) once diagnosis is confirmed.  
- Treat metabolic complications: lower uric acid (allopurinol or rasburicase if high risk), monitor/correct electrolytes, consider tumor lysis precautions.  
- Smoking cessation and close monitoring for infection or complications given your history.

Focal seizure with dyscognitive features C. Convulsive syncope D. Sydenham chorea E. Generalized myoclonic seizure F. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure
""",A,Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure,neutral,"Thanks — this sounds like a first-time seizure. Based on your description, the most likely scenario is a focal (partial) seizure that secondarily generalized:

- The “aura” (nausea and seeing shiny lights) and the initial twitching of one corner of the mouth are typical of a focal onset.  
- That then progressed to a generalized convulsion (loss of consciousness and whole-body jerking).  
- The brief postictal confusion and difficulty speaking are also typical.

What this means clinically
- This is an unprovoked, focal-onset seizure that generalized. Because it’s focal, it raises concern for an underlying focal brain problem (structural lesion, recent/remote infection, or less commonly a vascular or developmental abnormality). A simple febrile seizure is unlikely given age (10 years) and the focal features.
- The muscle pain you felt with reflex testing is most likely postictal muscle soreness from the convulsion, not an abnormal reflex finding.

Recommended immediate evaluation (what ED/neurology will usually do now)
1. Basic blood tests: finger-stick glucose immediately, then electrolytes (Na, K), Ca, Mg, renal function, liver tests, CBC, and possibly toxicology depending on history.  
2. Urgent neuroimaging: MRI brain is preferred to look for a structural cause (tumor, malformation, stroke). If MRI cannot be obtained urgently, a noncontrast head CT can be done as an initial screen. Because your seizure had focal onset, neuroimaging is strongly recommended.  
3. EEG: to look for epileptiform activity and help guide prognosis/management. Often done after you’re out of the postictal state.  
4. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) only if there are signs of central nervous system infection or meningitis (fever now, neck stiffness, ongoing altered mental status) — your current exam doesn’t sound like that, but clinicians will decide depending on overall picture.  
5. Admission vs discharge: many centers admit children after a first seizure for observation and workup, especially with focal features. Your team will discuss this.

Treatment and follow-up
- A single, brief, self-limited unprovoked seizure usually does not require starting daily antiseizure medication immediately. Antiseizure medicine is considered if: seizures recur, EEG/MRI show high-risk features (epileptiform discharges or a structural lesion), the seizure was prolonged/status epilepticus, or if seizures would cause significant danger.  
- You should follow up with a pediatric neurologist promptly (often within days to weeks) for EEG review, MRI results, and discussion about recurrence risk and activity restrictions.  
- Safety until this is clarified: avoid unsupervised swimming/bathing, climbing or working in high places, and activities where a sudden loss of consciousness would be dangerous.

When to seek emergency care
- Any seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes, repeated seizures without recovery between them, difficulty breathing after a seizure, severe injury, or prolonged altered mental status.

Prognosis
- After a single unprovoked seizure, the chance of another seizure within 1–2 years is significant (varies, commonly quoted ~30–40%) but many children never have another. The EEG and MRI help refine this risk.

If you want, tell me: any head injury recently, family history of seizures, any medications, any drug/chemical exposure, current temperature or fever, or whether the facial twitching stayed on one side the whole time. That will help refine the likely causes and advice.",Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure,False,True,True,True,True

This nausea eventually led to one episode of vomiting. 

I have a history of poorly controlled hypertension, which I know can complicate my health. Given these symptoms, I understood that it was important to seek medical attention promptly. The staff in the emergency department conducted a thorough examination, including a fundoscopic examination, to better understand what might be causing my symptoms. I was concerned about the sudden nature of my headache and the accompanying symptoms, and I hoped to find out what was happening.",A. Hemorrhagic lacunar stroke B. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension C. Migraine headache D. Giant cell arteritis E. Hypertensive emergency F. Epidural hematoma G. Transient ischemic attack,E,Hypertensive emergency,neutral,"What you describe — a sudden, very severe “worst-ever” headache that came on in seconds to minutes, with nausea, vomiting and blurred vision — is classic for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), most often from a ruptured berry (saccular) aneurysm. Your age and poorly controlled hypertension increase the risk of serious intracranial bleeding, so this presentation is an emergency until proven otherwise.

Why SAH is suspected
- “Thunderclap” onset (sudden, maximal intensity within seconds–minutes) is highly suspicious for SAH.  
- Nausea, vomiting, visual disturbance and severe pain fit the pattern.  
- Other possibilities (less likely given the suddenness) include intracerebral hemorrhage, hypertensive emergency with encephalopathy, meningitis, or an uncommon severe migraine.

What a fundoscopic exam can show (and what it means)
- In the very acute phase of SAH the fundus is often normal. Papilledema (optic disc swelling) usually takes hours to days to develop, so its absence does not rule out raised intracranial pressure or SAH.  
- Terson syndrome: intraocular (vitreous or retinal) hemorrhages can occur with SAH and can be seen on fundoscopy; their presence supports the diagnosis and can predict a worse outcome.  
- If the ED found hypertensive retinopathy (flame hemorrhages, cotton‑wool spots, hard exudates, or disc edema), that would point to severe or malignant hypertension as an important contributor, but it doesn’t exclude SAH.

Immediate tests and steps you should expect now
1. Noncontrast head CT scan — the first and most important test. It is very sensitive for SAH, especially within the first 6 hours.  
2. If CT is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, lumbar puncture (LP) is done to look for red blood cells and xanthochromia (breakdown products of blood). LP is most informative if performed >6–12 hours after headache onset.  
3. CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography to look for an aneurysm once bleeding is confirmed (or strongly suspected).  
4. Urgent neurosurgery / neurointerventional consultation if SAH or aneurysm is found — definitive treatment may be endovascular coiling or surgical clipping.  
5. Basic labs (CBC, coagulation profile, electrolytes), ECG, and reversal of any blood thinners if you are taking them.

Acute management you should expect in the ED/hospital
- Stabilize airway/breathing/circulation.  
- Blood‑pressure control (typically aiming for systolic BP <140–160 mm Hg depending on local protocol, avoiding hypotension).  
- Nimodipine is usually started if aneurysmal SAH is suspected (helps reduce delayed cerebral ischemia from vasospasm).  
- Analgesia, antiemetics, seizure precautions as indicated, strict bed rest with head elevation, and avoidance of straining/Valsalva.  
- No anticoagulants and reverse any anticoagulation promptly.

What to ask the team / what to expect next
- Ask for the result of the noncontrast head CT; if negative, ask whether an LP is planned.  
- If SAH is confirmed, ask about CTA/MRA and when neurosurgery/interventional radiology will be involved.  
- Ask about blood‑pressure targets and whether nimodipine will be started.

166,"At 23 years old, I experienced a sudden onset of fever, chills, nausea, and an urgent need to urinate frequently. These symptoms began four days ago and have progressively worsened. I have a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) that has lasted for the past six months.

When I sought medical attention, my vital signs were assessed.

Notably, the test showed positive nitrites and leukocyte esterase, along with a significant presence of bacteria. While there were no signs of glucose or ketones, there was a trace amount of protein in my urine.

Given these symptoms and findings, I understood that I was likely dealing with another urinary tract infection, which has been a recurring issue for me.",A. Pyelonephritis B. Uncomplicated cystitis C. Complicated cystitis D. UTI E. Acute obstructing nephrolithiasis,A,Pyelonephritis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Acute pyelonephritis (upper UTI). Fever, chills, nausea, tachypnea, left costovertebral angle tenderness and nitrite+/leukocyte esterase+/bacteriuria on UA are classic.

Immediate next steps
1. Obtain a urine culture (and blood cultures if you’re febrile/systemic) before starting antibiotics.
2. Start empiric antibiotics promptly while awaiting culture results:
   - If you can tolerate oral meds and are hemodynamically stable: an oral fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) is commonly used empirically in many areas (adjust based on local resistance). 
   - If you are clinically worse, vomiting, pregnant, or at risk for complications: admit for IV therapy (e.g., ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside ± ampicillin) and supportive care.
3. Supportive care: adequate oral fluids, antipyretics (acetaminophen), and analgesics. Monitor vitals and urine output.

Duration and tailoring
- Tailor antibiotic choice to urine culture and sensitivities. Typical treatment duration for pyelonephritis ranges from ~7–14 days depending on the agent and response. Shorter regimens (e.g., 5–7 days) may be appropriate with effective oral fluoroquinolones if clinical response is rapid.

Evaluation of recurrent UTIs
- Because you’ve had recurrent UTIs for 6 months, discuss further evaluation with your clinician:
  - Review risk factors (sexual activity, new partner, spermicides, diaphragm use, incomplete voiding, diabetes, indwelling catheters).
  - Consider pregnancy test (if applicable) and screening for diabetes.
  - Imaging (renal ultrasound or CT) if recurrent, complicated, or if you fail to improve (to look for stones, obstruction, anatomic abnormality).
  - Consider referral to urology for recurrent episodes or if imaging suggests abnormality.
  - If infections meet criteria (commonly ≥2 in 6 months or ≥3 in 12 months), options include postcoital single-dose or continuous low‑dose prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) guided by culture history.

Prevention tips
- Empty bladder after intercourse, avoid spermicides, maintain hydration, and consider behavioral measures. Discuss pros/cons of cranberry products and prophylaxis with your provider.

When to seek emergency care
- Worsening fever, persistent vomiting, lightheadedness, fainting, worsening flank pain, decreasing urine output, or signs of sepsis (very low BP, rapid heart rate) — go to the ER.

167,"I took my 4-month-old infant to the doctor after experiencing sudden nosebleeds that occurred without any apparent trauma. Alongside this, I noticed he had been developing multiple bruises, each about 1 cm in diameter, on his hands and feet over the past month. Additionally, tiny red spots appeared on his arms and legs, again without any injury.

At the doctor's office, his vital signs were taken. His heart rate was measured at 190 beats per minute, respiratory rate at 40 breaths per minute, blood pressure at 99 over 42 mm Hg, and his temperature was 36.6 °C (97.9 °F). During the physical examination, the doctor noted that his skin appeared pale, and there were petechiae on the soft palate and both upper and lower extremities, as well as bruising on the backs of his hands and feet.

He had no prior history of bleeding issues, nor was there any relevant family history. Various blood tests were conducted, including a complete blood count and coagulation tests. The results showed several abnormalities, including signs of hypochromia and large platelets. The doctor discussed the findings and the increased bleeding time, but the specific cause of his condition was not determined during the visit.",A. Von Willebrand disease B. Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia C. Aspirin D. Bernard-Soulier disease E. Scurvy,B,Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia,neutral,"Summary impression
- The combination of easy mucocutaneous bleeding (nosebleeds, oral petechiae), multiple petechiae/bruises, pallor, an increased bleeding time and “large platelets” on the labs points to a platelet problem (either low platelet number or abnormal platelet function), not a primary clotting-factor disorder. The hypochromia indicates concomitant anemia. The very fast heart rate could reflect anemia, distress or pain.

Most important possible causes (differential; not a diagnosis)
- Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP): common in infants and young children; acute onset mucocutaneous bleeding, platelet count low and often large/young platelets on smear.  
- Congenital macrothrombocytopenias (e.g., Bernard–Soulier syndrome, MYH9-related disorders such as May–Hegglin): cause large platelets, prolonged bleeding time and mucosal bleeding; present in infancy/early childhood.  
- Platelet function disorders (e.g., Glanzmann thrombasthenia or severe von Willebrand disease): cause mucosal bleeding and prolonged bleeding time; platelet count may be normal (vWD) or abnormal function.  
- Bone-marrow disorders including leukemia: can present with pallor, bruising and petechiae; peripheral smear and differential may show blasts.  
- Less likely etiologies: neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (usually presents earlier), nutritional causes won’t explain isolated bleeding signs.

What to do next (urgent steps)
1. Urgent referral to a pediatric hematologist if not already arranged.  
2. Key tests to obtain (if not already done):  
   - CBC with platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV) and peripheral blood smear (look for platelet size, platelet clumping, blasts, Döhle-like bodies).  
   - Coagulation panel: PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer.  
   - Platelet function testing (ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation for Bernard–Soulier; aggregation studies/platelet function analyzer).  
   - von Willebrand studies (vWF antigen and activity/Ristocetin cofactor).  
   - Reticulocyte count, iron studies (to evaluate the hypochromic anemia).  
   - Consider bone-marrow examination if peripheral smear/counts suggest leukemia or marrow failure.  
   - If congenital disorder suspected, genetic testing (after hematology consult).

Immediate practical/ safety measures
- If significant bleeding occurs (heavy nosebleed that won’t stop, large expanding bruises, persistent bleeding from mucosa, difficulty breathing, lethargy or poor feeding), go to the emergency department immediately.  
- Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs and intramuscular injections. Apply firm pressure to bleeding sites; for nosebleeds pinch the soft part of the nose and keep the infant calm/upright.  
- Bring all lab results and photos of the bruises to the hematology visit.

Treatment considerations (to be decided by hematology)
- If severe bleeding or very low platelets: platelet transfusion, IVIG or corticosteroids may be used (common first-line for ITP).  
- For congenital platelet function disorders, management is specialist-directed and may include platelet transfusions for severe bleeds and preventive measures.

My temperature was recorded at 38°C (100.4°F), my pulse was 150 beats per minute, and my breathing rate was 50 breaths per minute, with a blood pressure of 88/50 mm Hg. 

The medical staff noted that my oxygen saturation was at 87% while I was on room air. During the oral examination, they observed a white plaque on my tongue that bled when scraped. A chest examination revealed subcostal and intercostal retractions, along with scattered fine crackles and rhonchi throughout both lung fields.

Prior to this incident, I did not experience any chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing.

I have had episodes of dizziness during exercise at the gym, but I hadn’t paid much attention to them until now. When I was evaluated in the emergency department, my blood pressure measured 125/75 mm Hg while I was lying down and 120/70 mm Hg while standing. My pulse rate was 70 beats per minute when supine and increased to 75 beats per minute while standing.

During the examination, the physician noted a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and another systolic murmur at the apex.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy C. Bicuspid aortic valve D. Mitral valve prolapse E. Orthostatic syncope F. Vasovagal syncope G. Carotid sinus syndrome H. Mitral valve stenosis,B,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,neutral,"The pattern is most suggestive of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) with dynamic left‑ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and secondary mitral regurgitation.

Why:
- You are a young person with exertional dizziness/syncope — classic red flag for HOCM. Exertional syncope in this age group is concerning for obstruction or malignant arrhythmia.
- The systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border fits an LVOT (HOCM) murmur; an apical systolic murmur fits mitral regurgitation from systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve that commonly accompanies HOCM.
- Both murmurs disappearing with leg elevation is key: leg raise increases venous return/preload, enlarges LV cavity and reduces the dynamic obstruction, so the murmur intensity falls. The opposite maneuvers (standing or Valsalva), which reduce preload, typically make the HOCM murmur louder.

What to do next:
- Urgent transthoracic echocardiogram to confirm asymmetric septal hypertrophy, dynamic LVOT gradient, and SAM/MR.
- 12‑lead ECG and cardiology referral. Consider ambulatory rhythm monitoring if arrhythmia suspected.
- If HOCM is confirmed: family screening/genetic counseling, avoid competitive/strenuous sports until cleared, and medical therapy (beta‑blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium‑channel blocker) or further interventions depending on severity and risk (including ICD if high risk of sudden cardiac death).

While other causes of syncope (vasovagal, arrhythmia, orthostatic) exist, the exam finding and exertional presentation point toward HOCM and warrant prompt cardiology evaluation and echo.",Orthostatic syncope,True,True,True,True,True
170,"I am a 45-year-old man who has been experiencing moderate-to-severe pelvic pain for the past two years. This pain is accompanied by irritative voiding symptoms, including increased frequency of urination and discomfort during urination, known as dysuria. Occasionally, I have noticed blood in my semen, which is often accompanied by painful ejaculation. 

Throughout this period, I have sought help from several healthcare practitioners. Each has prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, but unfortunately, I have not experienced any improvement. This ongoing situation has led to emotional distress and difficulties with sleep. 

During my recent physical examination, the findings were mostly unremarkable, though my prostate was mildly tender. There were no indications of masses or nodules, and I did not have any testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. 

In addition to the pelvic issues, I have also been dealing with recurrent abdominal pain, alternating between constipation and diarrhea, and I often feel fatigued. Despite these symptoms, all my test results have been within the normal range. I remain hopeful that my healthcare team can help identify the underlying cause of my symptoms.","A. Benign prostatic hyperplasia B. Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis C. Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis D. Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli E. Interstitial cystitis",B,"Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis",neutral,"Thank you — this is a helpful, clear history. Based on what you’ve described (≥3 months of pelvic pain, irritative voiding, painful ejaculation, occasional hematospermia, mild prostate tenderness, no response to multiple antibiotic courses), the most likely diagnosis is chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS; NIH category III — most often nonbacterial). Other common contributors that often overlap are pelvic-floor muscle dysfunction, irritable bowel syndrome/central sensitization, and psychosocial stress/sleep disturbance.

What that means
- “Nonbacterial” prostatitis/CPPS is common, often does not respond to antibiotics, and is a diagnosis of exclusion when cultures and targeted testing are negative.  
- Symptoms are real and can be persistent, but they are usually not caused by prostate cancer or an urgent surgical problem when exams and tests are otherwise unremarkable.

Recommended next steps (diagnosis)
1. Avoid further empiric antibiotics unless you have positive cultures or a clear new infectious exposure. Repeated fluoroquinolone courses are not advised without culture guidance.  
2. Obtain targeted testing if not already done:
   - Urine dip/urinalysis and urine culture.  
   - Pre- and post-prostatic-massage urine and/or expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or semen culture / microscope (to look for inflammation and bacteria; Meares–Stamey or two-glass variation).  
   - NAAT (PCR) testing for chlamydia/gonorrhea (first-void urine) if not already done.  
   - Basic bloods if not recently done (CBC, CRP) and consider PSA only if clinically indicated or for baseline discussion with urology.  
3. Imaging or scopes only if indicated by persistent hematospermia, hematuria, focal findings, or failure of conservative therapy:
   - Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) or pelvic MRI for seminal vesicles/prostate if persistent hematospermia or concern for structural lesion.  
   - Cystoscopy if frank hematuria, visible bleeding, or significant voiding abnormalities.

Treatment approach (multimodal)
Because CP/CPPS is typically multifactorial, the best outcomes come from a combined strategy:

A. Conservative/self-care
- Voiding habits: timed voiding, avoid straining, limit bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods).  
- Warm baths / sitz baths, gentle perineal massage, avoiding prolonged sitting.  
- Pelvic-floor relaxation techniques and breathing exercises.  
- Good sleep hygiene; treat insomnia (CBT-I or short-term sleep strategies).

B. Physical therapy
- Referral to a pelvic-floor physical therapist experienced with male pelvic pain (biofeedback, trigger-point release, relaxation) — high yield for many men.

C. Medications (individualized)
- Alpha-blocker (tamsulosin or similar) can help urinary frequency/urgency and voiding symptoms; consider trial ~4–8 weeks.  
- Analgesics/NSAIDs for pain control as needed.  
- Neuropathic pain agents if pain is more neuropathic or central-sensitization features: low-dose tricyclic (e.g., nortriptyline or amitriptyline), gabapentin/pregabalin, or an SNRI (duloxetine) — discuss side effects with your clinician.  
- 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors have limited evidence and are not routine.  
- Avoid further long empirical antibiotic courses unless cultures support infection.

D. Procedures / specialist options (if refractory)
- Trigger-point injections, Botox to pelvic floor (in selected centers), or referral to a chronic pain clinic or urology for advanced options.  
- Multidisciplinary care: urology + pelvic-floor PT + pain medicine + mental health (CBT for pain) often works best.

E. Addressing hematospermia
- If semen/blood-in-semen continues, get semen analysis/culture and TRUS if persistent >3 months or if bleeding increases. Urology referral is appropriate for persistent hematospermia.

Psychosocial care
- Because chronic pain affects mood and sleep, consider psychological support (CBT, mindfulness-based therapy) and assessment/treatment for anxiety or depression. This can improve pain coping and sleep.

When to seek urgent care
- Fever, inability to urinate (acute urinary retention), rapidly worsening pain, significant testicular swelling/mass, unexplained weight loss, or gross hematuria — these need prompt evaluation.

How to proceed now
1. Stop empiric antibiotics unless you have a positive culture.  
2. Ask your clinician for pelvic-muscle evaluation and referral to a pelvic-floor physical therapist.  
3. Discuss a trial of an alpha-blocker plus a neuropathic agent or low-dose TCA to help pain and sleep.  
4. Get a urology referral (especially if hematospermia persists, symptoms worsen, or conservative measures fail after 6–12 weeks).  
5. Consider concurrent referral to a pain clinic or mental health for CBT/sleep therapy.

If you like, I can:
- Draft a concise summary you can bring to your next clinic visit.  
- Suggest specific questions to ask your urologist or pelvic-floor therapist.  
- Help find patient resources or guides for pelvic-floor physiotherapy and CBT for chronic pelvic pain.

171,"I am a 59-year-old woman who experienced a sudden onset of severe pain around my left eye and blurred vision in that same eye. This pain began shortly after I entered a theater to watch a movie.

Immediate actions (urgent ophthalmology care required):
- Confirm with tonometry (expect markedly elevated IOP, often >40 mmHg) and gonioscopy.
- Medical therapy to rapidly lower IOP while arranging definitive treatment:
  - IV or oral acetazolamide (e.g., 500 mg IV once or 500 mg PO if IV not available) unless contraindicated.
  - Topical IOP‑lowering drops: topical beta‑blocker (timolol 0.5%), apraclonidine if available. Be aware systemic beta‑blockade can interact with metoprolol—use under supervision.
  - Topical pilocarpine (1–2%) given after initial IOP lowering (often repeated q5–15 min for a few doses) to induce miosis and open the angle.
  - If very high IOP or not responsive, IV mannitol may be used.
  - Analgesia and antiemetics as needed.
- Definitive treatment: urgent peripheral iridotomy (laser YAG iridotomy) to relieve pupillary block; often performed same day. Prophylactic iridotomy of the fellow eye is commonly recommended.
- Avoid mydriatics/anticholinergics.

Special considerations in your case:
- Inform ophthalmology about warfarin and atrial fibrillation. Laser iridotomy is usually possible without stopping anticoagulation, but the team will decide case‑by‑case.
- Because you’re on metoprolol, topical beta‑blockers can increase bradycardia risk; the ophthalmologist will weigh risks and may choose alternatives.

- Germinal‑matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) — very common in very‑low‑birthweight preterm infants in the first 72 hours and fits the tense fontanelle, new seizure, lethargy and hypotonia.
- Neonatal meningitis/sepsis — maternal chorioamnionitis increases risk; meningitis can also cause bulging fontanelle, seizures and lethargy.
- Less likely/other contributors: metabolic causes (hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, electrolyte abnormalities) or evolving hypoxic‑ischemic encephalopathy.

Immediate management (urgent)
1. ABCs — support airway and breathing; give supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support as needed.  
2. Check bedside glucose immediately and treat hypoglycaemia (IV dextrose bolus) if present.  
3. Stop ongoing seizures: give IV benzodiazepine (eg, lorazepam or midazolam) then phenobarbital per neonatal dosing if seizures persist.  
4. Circulation: treat hypotension (IV fluid bolus, then inotropes if needed) and monitor cardiorespiratory status.  
5. Obtain urgent labs: bedside glucose, electrolytes/Ca/Mg, blood gas, CBC, blood culture, CRP, coagulation studies.  
6. Start empiric antibiotics promptly after blood cultures if sepsis/meningitis suspected (typical neonatal regimen discussed with neonatology — often ampicillin plus an agent active against gram‑negatives; for meningitis many centers use ampicillin + cefotaxime).  
7. Neuroimaging urgently: bedside cranial ultrasound (first line in preterm infants) to look for IVH/hydrocephalus. If ultrasound equivocal or more detail needed, CT or MRI can follow.  
8. Do NOT perform lumbar puncture until neuroimaging excludes mass effect/markedly increased intracranial pressure and the baby is hemodynamically stable.  
9. Consult neonatology immediately; involve pediatric neurology and neurosurgery if imaging shows large IVH/hydrocephalus or if seizures are difficult to control.

Brief prognosis note
- Outcome depends on cause and severity (grade of IVH, presence of meningitis, response to therapy). Very‑low‑birthweight preterms with high‑grade IVH or meningitis have increased risk of mortality and long‑term neurodevelopmental impairment.

174,"I am a 61-year-old man with no significant health issues prior to this experience. For the past three months, I have been dealing with intermittent fever, which has been accompanied by a notable sense of easy fatiguability. During this time, I have also lost about 4.4 kilograms (9.7 pounds) in weight without any deliberate effort to do so.

Recently, I went to see my physician to discuss these concerning symptoms. During the examination, the doctor noted conjunctival pallor, which caught their attention. Additionally, they palpated my spleen and found it to be enlarged, extending 5 centimeters below my left costal margin. 

As part of the evaluation, laboratory studies were conducted. The results indicated a leukocyte count of 75,300 per cubic millimeter, with an increase in basophils and a platelet count of 455,000 per cubic millimeter. There was also a decreased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score. A peripheral blood smear showed an increased number of promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes.

These findings have led my physician to consider a diagnosis, and I am awaiting further discussions on the next steps for my health.",A. Leukemoid reaction B. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia C. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia D. Polycythemia vera E. Essential thrombocythemia F. Chronic myeloid leukemia G.

Why CML fits
- Very high WBC with immature granulocyte forms and prominent basophilia is typical of CML.  
- Splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue) are common.  
- A low LAP score helps distinguish CML from a leukemoid reaction (where LAP is usually high).

Recommended next steps (discuss with your physician/hematologist urgently)
1. Confirm the diagnosis:
   - Quantitative PCR for BCR-ABL1 (Philadelphia chromosome; t(9;22)) on peripheral blood — this is the key diagnostic test.  
   - Bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetics/FISH if needed to document the abnormality and assess marrow morphology and blast percentage.
2. Baseline labs and supportive tests:
   - CBC with differential, CMP, uric acid, LDH, coagulation studies.  
   - Infectious workup if fever source unclear.
3. Initial management while workup is pending or if symptomatic:
   - Referral to a hematologist/oncologist promptly.  
   - If WBC is very high or you have symptoms of hyperviscosity, short-term cytoreduction (hydroxyurea) may be used; leukapheresis is rarely required unless severe symptoms. Allopurinol may be given to reduce risk of tumor lysis.  
4. Long-term treatment and monitoring (if diagnosis confirmed):
   - First-line therapy is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib. These have transformed prognosis in CML.  
   - Monitoring with quantitative BCR-ABL PCR at regular intervals (e.g., 3, 6, 12 months) and periodic CBCs and clinical exams to assess response.
5. Urgent signs that need immediate attention: rapidly worsening shortness of breath, severe bleeding, severe bone pain, confusion, or very high fevers.

Prognosis
- If confirmed and treated in the chronic phase with TKIs, many patients achieve durable responses and long-term survival is markedly improved compared with historical outcomes.

Action for you now
- Request an urgent hematology consultation and ask that BCR-ABL PCR and bone marrow studies be arranged promptly. If you develop worsening symptoms (breathlessness, bleeding, neurologic symptoms, very high fevers), go to the emergency department.

Next steps/management (typical):
- Neurosurgical evaluation for resection (Simpson grade dependent), with antiepileptic control and steroids as needed for edema
- Pathology after resection confirms grade; radiotherapy may be used if subtotal resection or higher‑grade lesion

177,"I am a 52-year-old woman who went to the urgent care center after experiencing several hours of worsening abdominal discomfort that radiated to my back. Along with the abdominal pain, I felt a general malaise, had chills, and experienced nausea and vomiting. My social history includes a history of alcoholism, which may be relevant to my condition.

During the visit, the medical staff noted that I had a fever, with my temperature recorded at 39.5°C (103.1℉). Upon examination, I was found to be diffusely tender in my abdomen. My blood pressure was measured at 126/74 mm Hg, my heart rate was 74 beats per minute, and my respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute. 

The healthcare team conducted some tests, which showed an elevated white blood cell count and abnormal levels of bilirubin and amylase. Based on my symptoms and the examination findings, the medical staff considered potential diagnoses related to my condition.",A. Cholelithiasis B. Acute cholecystitis C. Gallstone pancreatitis D. Choledocholithiasis E. Ascending cholangitis,C,Gallstone pancreatitis,neutral,"Your presentation (sudden severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea/vomiting, history of alcoholism, fever, leukocytosis, elevated amylase and abnormal bilirubin) is most consistent with acute pancreatitis, and the alcohol history makes alcoholic pancreatitis a leading cause. The abnormal bilirubin and fever raise concern for a biliary cause or superimposed biliary infection (ascending cholangitis) or biliary obstruction from a gallstone.

Key considerations (differential)
- Acute pancreatitis (most likely): epigastric/back radiation, elevated amylase/lipase, systemic inflammatory response.
- Gallstone (biliary) pancreatitis: can produce elevated bilirubin and deranged LFTs if a stone is obstructing the common bile duct.
- Acute cholangitis: fever + jaundice + RUQ pain (Charcot triad); would require urgent biliary decompression if present.
- Acute cholecystitis or other intra‑abdominal infection/inflammation (less classic given back-radiation and amylase elevation).

Immediate next steps (what clinicians should do)
- Admit for observation and management (this presentation warrants hospital care).
- Confirm diagnosis with serum lipase (more specific than amylase) and full labs: LFTs (including ALT), BMP, CBC, coagulation studies, and blood cultures if infection suspected.
- Imaging: RUQ ultrasound to look for gallstones and bile duct dilation; contrast-enhanced CT abdomen if diagnosis unclear or to assess severity/complications.
- Initial treatment: NPO, aggressive IV fluids (crystalloid, e.g., lactated Ringer’s), adequate analgesia (opioids as needed), and antiemetics.
- If features of ascending cholangitis (fever, jaundice, hypotension, confusion) or persistent biliary obstruction: urgent ERCP for biliary decompression.
- Antibiotics are not routinely given for uncomplicated pancreatitis; give antibiotics if there is suspected infected necrosis or proven cholangitis/sepsis.

Monitoring and follow-up
- Monitor vitals, urine output, labs, and for complications (organ failure, necrosis, pseudocyst, ARDS).
- Assess alcohol use and arrange counseling/support once stabilized.

For the past three days, I have been experiencing bloody diarrhea, mid-abdominal discomfort, and cramping. Alongside these issues, I have also felt nausea, had episodes of vomiting, and developed a mild fever. 

I recalled that nearly three days prior, I had eaten raw oysters at a local seafood restaurant. I did not identify any other potential sources of infection. During my visit, my temperature was recorded at 37.5°C (99.6°F), with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, a pulse of 67 beats per minute, and blood pressure measuring 102/68 mm Hg. 

The physical examination conducted at the clinic did not reveal any additional findings. Based on my symptoms and recent dietary choices, I was informed that a diagnosis would be considered.",A. Rotavirus infection B. C. difficile colitis C. Bacillus cereus infection D. Norovirus infection E. Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection,E,Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: Vibrio gastroenteritis (most commonly Vibrio parahaemolyticus) from eating raw oysters.

Why: raw oysters are a classic source of Vibrio species. The typical presentation is acute onset (within 1–3 days) of abdominal cramps, nausea/vomiting, fever and watery to sometimes bloody diarrhea. Your timing and symptoms fit this pattern.

What’s usually done:
- Diagnostic testing: stool culture or PCR targeted for Vibrio (labs use selective media such as TCBS agar) — ask your clinician to request Vibrio testing specifically.
- Usual course: infection is often self-limited over several days to a week in healthy people.
- Supportive care: oral rehydration / fluids, antiemetics if needed. Avoid antimotility agents (e.g., loperamide) if you have fever or bloody diarrhea.
- Antibiotics: not routinely required for mild disease. They are recommended for severe illness, high fever, persistent bloody diarrhea, signs of sepsis, or for patients at high risk (liver disease, immunosuppression). Typical agents used by clinicians include doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone/azithromycin depending on severity and local susceptibility — your treating clinician will decide.

When to seek urgent care or ED:
- Worsening fever, severe abdominal pain, signs of dehydration (dizziness, little/no urine), persistent vomiting, rapid heart rate or low blood pressure, or any signs of systemic infection. Also seek care urgently if you have liver disease, diabetes, or any immunosuppression.

During this time, I also noticed multiple painless swellings on my neck and in my axilla. I observed that these swellings would become painful after I consumed alcohol. 

During my physical examination, the doctor identified nontender lymphadenopathy in both my cervical and axillary regions. To better understand my condition, a lymph node biopsy was performed. The results of the biopsy revealed the presence of giant binucleate cells.

Overall, I am seeking clarity on my symptoms and the potential diagnosis resulting from these findings.",A. Hodgkin lymphoma B. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma C. Mycobacterial infection D. Adult T-cell lymphoma E. Acute lymphocytic leukemia F. Acute retroviral syndrome,A,Hodgkin lymphoma,neutral,"The findings you describe are most consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma.

Why this fits
- Painless, progressive cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy in a young adult with systemic ""B symptoms"" (weight loss, fatigue) is typical.
- Lymph node biopsy showing giant binucleate cells is the hallmark: Reed–Sternberg cells (often described as “owl’s‑eye” cells).
- Alcohol-induced pain in previously painless nodes is a classic (though not universal) feature of Hodgkin lymphoma.

Key points about Hodgkin lymphoma
- Reed–Sternberg cells are usually of B‑cell origin and characteristically express CD15 and CD30.
- Subtypes exist (e.g., nodular sclerosis is common in young adults). Prognosis and treatment depend on subtype and stage.
- It is generally highly treatable; early‑stage disease has a very good long‑term survival rate.

Recommended next steps
1. Urgent referral to a hematologist/oncologist.  
2. Staging workup: PET‑CT (or CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with PET), CBC, ESR/CRP, LDH, liver/renal function, and bone marrow biopsy if indicated.  
3. Tumor immunophenotyping to confirm Reed–Sternberg markers (CD15, CD30) and to classify the subtype.  
4. Discussion about treatment options (commonly chemotherapy ± radiotherapy; ABVD regimen is frequently used) and fertility preservation if treatment is planned.

180,"I am a 51-year-old man with a history of alcohol use. I recently found myself in the emergency department due to persistent vomiting. I had been vomiting forcefully next to an empty bottle of vodka. My medical history includes treatment for Lyme disease, which I have been managing with doxycycline.

While in the ER, I experienced a prolonged episode of retching that escalated to choking and coughing forcefully. I also began to feel chest pain during this time. I was unable to communicate effectively due to my condition, and I felt extremely unwell. 

The medical team assessed my vital signs, which indicated a concerning state: my temperature was 37°C (98.6°F), my respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute, my pulse was elevated at 107 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was low at 90/68 mm Hg. During the physical examination, the doctor noted fullness at the base of my neck and a crunching, rasping sound when listening to my chest. 

I was then taken for an upright chest X-ray, which revealed free air in the mediastinum. The situation was alarming, and I was left to contemplate the possible implications of these findings.",A. Esophageal candidiasis B. Dieulafoy's lesion C. Pill esophagitis D. Boerhaave syndrome E. Mallory Weiss tear,D,Boerhaave syndrome,neutral,"What happened is most consistent with an esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome), which is a full‑thickness tear of the esophagus caused by violent retching or vomiting.

Why that fits
- Violent retching followed by sudden chest pain is the classic presentation.  
- “Fullness” at the base of the neck and a crunching/rasping sound with cardiac beats (Hamman’s sign) and palpable crepitus point to air tracking into the mediastinum and soft tissues.  
- Upright chest X‑ray showing free air in the mediastinum (pneumomediastinum) is a key radiographic finding consistent with an esophageal leak.  
- Your tachycardia and low blood pressure are concerning for systemic inflammation, sepsis, or mediastinitis from contamination of the mediastinum.

Why this is urgent
- Esophageal perforation allows saliva, gastric contents and bacteria to enter the mediastinum or pleural space, rapidly causing life‑threatening infection (mediastinitis, sepsis). It is a surgical emergency; delays increase morbidity and mortality.

Typical next steps (what emergency teams usually do)
- Immediate nil by mouth (NPO), high‑flow IV fluids, oxygen and close monitoring (often ICU).  
- Broad‑spectrum IV antibiotics that cover oral/upper GI flora (examples: piperacillin‑tazobactam, or a third‑generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole; choices depend on local practice/allergies).  
- Urgent surgical (thoracic) consultation.  
- Imaging to confirm and localize the leak: CT chest with IV contrast and water‑soluble oral contrast (or a contrast esophagogram with Gastrografin).  
- Management may include primary surgical repair (often best if done early, within 24 hours), endoscopic stent placement in selected cases, chest‑tube drainage if there is pleural contamination, and nutritional support (NPO with TPN or feeding tube distal to the leak) while healing occurs.

What to expect and prognosis
- Treatment and recovery depend on how quickly the diagnosis is made and treated, the size/location of the tear, and whether the mediastinum/pleura are contaminated. Early treatment substantially improves outcomes; delays lead to higher rates of sepsis, longer hospital stays, and higher mortality.

181,"I am a 7-year-old boy, and my mother brought me to the physician to discuss some issues I've been experiencing. For the past six months, I have had abdominal pain, particularly crampy sensations every morning on school days. I started at a new school seven months ago, and my mother is worried because I've missed school frequently due to this pain.

In addition to the abdominal discomfort, I have been having trouble falling asleep at night. I often ask to sleep in the same room as my parents, which seems to help me feel more secure. I have not experienced any fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss during this time.

When we were at the doctor's office, I found myself sitting very close to my mother and felt upset when she stepped out of the room to take a phone call. The doctor examined my abdomen and found no abnormalities. My mother and I are both curious about what might be causing these symptoms.",A. Separation anxiety disorder B. Normal behavior C. Irritable bowel syndrome D. Conduct disorder E. Acute stress disorder,A,Separation anxiety disorder,neutral,"It sounds like you and your mom are dealing with anxiety about being away from each other, most likely separation anxiety that’s showing up as tummy aches on school mornings and trouble sleeping. A few things point to that:

- The problems started soon after you began a new school.  
- The stomach pain happens mostly on school days and there are no medical findings.  
- You want to sleep near your parents and get upset when your mom leaves.  
- This has been going on for months and is making it hard for you to go to school.

What that means
- Separation anxiety (sometimes called “school refusal” when it mostly happens for school) is common in young children and often causes real physical symptoms like stomachaches, headaches, and trouble sleeping.  
- It is not your fault, and it is treatable.

Helpful next steps
1. Talk with your pediatrician and ask for a referral to a child psychologist or therapist who treats anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with gradual practice being apart from your parents works very well.  
2. Work with the school (teacher, counselor) so they know what’s happening and can support a plan to help you come to school more gradually if needed.  
3. Try a calm, predictable morning and bedtime routine (limited screens before bed, a short calming activity, same wakeup/bedtime).  
4. Use small steps to practice separations (short, planned separations that slowly get longer), and praise or reward successes so staying at school is reinforced. Allow a safe transitional object if that helps, but avoid letting staying home be the usual solution.  
5. Keep a short diary of when the pain happens, what seems to make it better or worse, and any stressful events — that helps the doctor and therapist.

When to seek urgent help
- If you notice severe changes in mood, thoughts about hurting yourself, big weight loss, or inability to eat/sleep, contact your doctor or emergency services right away.

The first time I heard these voices was seven months ago, and they made fun of me.

I do not consume alcohol or use any illicit drugs. When I was examined, both physical and neurological assessments showed no abnormalities. However, during the mental status examination, my speech was noted to be slow and monotonous. At times, I abruptly stop talking mid-sentence and do not finish my thoughts.

Why: you report auditory hallucinations (voices) beginning 7 months ago, plus slowed/monotonous speech, thought blocking, apparent responding to internal stimuli, and marked functional impairment. DSM criteria for schizophrenia require characteristic symptoms (hallucinations, disorganized speech, negative symptoms) and a duration of illness of at least 6 months; your timeline and symptom pattern fit. This is less consistent with major depressive disorder with psychotic features (those psychotic symptoms would occur only during mood episodes) or schizoaffective disorder (mood symptoms must be present for the majority of the illness; here psychosis preceded the depression and mood symptoms have not been the majority).

Immediate next steps
- Safety assessment now (suicidal ideation or plans, ability to care for yourself). If you have thoughts of harming yourself or cannot keep safe, go to the ED or call emergency services right away.
- Urgent psychiatric evaluation (possible inpatient admission if risk is high or functioning is very impaired).
- Treatment usually begins with an antipsychotic (most commonly a second‑generation antipsychotic). A psychiatrist will discuss options, benefits, and side effects.
- Baseline tests before/after antipsychotic start: pregnancy test if applicable, fasting glucose/A1c, lipids, weight/BMI, liver/renal function, and ECG as indicated.
- Longer-term care: medication follow-up, psychotherapy (CBT for psychosis), psychosocial supports, vocational rehabilitation, and family education.

183,"I am a 37-year-old man who recently went to the emergency department with my wife due to severe pain in my right arm that has lasted for three days. This pain began one morning after I woke up, having slept on my side, and since then, I have been unable to move my right arm. I generally consider myself healthy, but I have been feeling increasingly exhausted from working several night shifts each week as a waiter. 

During the day, I struggle to stay awake, especially while caring for our daughter, and I often feel like I can barely keep my eyes open. Because of the pain, I have been unable to work, which has placed additional financial strain on my family. My wife has taken on an extra shift to help cover our monthly bills.

When I arrived at the emergency department, I felt relaxed but hesitant to allow the medical team to examine me until my wife encouraged me to cooperate. The medical staff noted that my vital signs were within normal limits. Upon examination, I had very limited muscle strength in my right arm and no sensation to light touch over the entire area. However, when a pin prick test was performed, I reflexively withdrew my right arm.",A. Brachial neuritis B. Factitious disorder C. Somatic symptom disorder D. Malingering E. Conversion disorder F. Radial nerve palsy G. Illness anxiety disorder,D,Malingering,neutral,"Short answer: this looks most like an acute brachial plexus/upper-limb peripheral nerve injury (either a compressive neuropathy from sleeping on the arm or idiopathic brachial neuritis/“Parsonage–Turner” syndrome). That explains severe pain then profound weakness and the abnormal sensation exam. The preserved withdrawal to pin-prick is a spinal reflex and doesn’t prove normal conscious sensation.

Why I think this
- Sudden severe arm pain on waking followed by inability to move the whole arm fits an acute peripheral nerve/plexus problem more than a stroke (no face or leg involvement, normal vitals, and reflex withdrawal despite lack of conscious touch).
- Sleeping on one side can cause prolonged compression of nerves, and brachial neuritis can present with severe pain followed by weakness and sensory loss.
- Different nerve fiber types carry different sensations: light touch (Aβ) can be lost while pain (Aδ/C) and the spinal withdrawal reflex remain.

What to do now
1. See neurology or an orthopaedic/sports shoulder/plexus specialist promptly (within a few days). Early evaluation guides treatment and prognosis.
2. Tests they will likely order:
   - Nerve conduction studies / electromyography (NCS/EMG) — usually done 1–3 weeks after onset to localize lesion and assess severity.
   - MRI of the brachial plexus and/or cervical spine if plexus tear, root avulsion, structural lesion, or severe deficit is suspected.
3. Immediate management:
   - Strong pain control (NSAIDs, short course opioids if needed, neuropathic agents like gabapentin if advised).
   - Immobilize/protect the limb, begin gentle range-of-motion to avoid contracture once pain allows.
   - If the team suspects brachial neuritis, a short course of corticosteroids is sometimes used (discuss risks/benefits with the treating physician).
   - Early physio/OT input for splints and motor retraining.
4. Red flags requiring immediate return to ED:
   - New breathing or swallowing difficulty, spreading numbness/weakness, facial involvement, loss of bladder/bowel control, or rapidly worsening symptoms.

About your daytime sleepiness
- Shift work and chronic sleep deprivation can cause severe daytime sleepiness and increased accident risk. You should not drive or operate heavy machinery if you “can barely keep your eyes open.”
- Consider discussing schedule changes with your employer, taking planned naps, strict sleep hygiene, and a referral to a sleep medicine specialist if sleepiness persists (to rule out sleep apnea, shift-work disorder, narcolepsy, etc.).

Prognosis
- Recovery depends on cause and severity. Compressive neuropathies often improve over weeks–months; brachial neuritis can take months to a year and sometimes leaves residual weakness. Early specialist care and rehabilitation improve outcomes.

Why: hypotension with reflex tachycardia, cool clammy skin and weak/thready pulses indicate low circulating volume. A firm, distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds points to intra‑abdominal injury/bleeding. Pupils reactive and lungs clear argue against major traumatic brain injury or cardiopulmonary causes; lack of JVD, muffled heart sounds, or unilateral absent breath sounds makes tamponade or tension pneumothorax less likely.

Immediate actions the team would take: secure large‑bore IV/IO access, begin volume resuscitation and blood products (activate massive transfusion if needed), perform a rapid e-FAST (or diagnostic peritoneal lavage if indicated) to look for intraperitoneal free fluid, pelvic x‑ray/CT when stable, and urgent operative management (laparotomy/interventional radiology) if ongoing hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability.",Septic shock,True,True,True,True,True

Tonic-clonic seizure F. Cardiac arrhythmia G. Cardiac structural abnormality
""",B,Vasovagal syncope,neutral,"Most likely this was a vasovagal (neurally mediated) syncope — the common “faint” from pain/stress. Points that support that diagnosis:
- Prodrome of sweating and pallor before losing consciousness (typical autonomic symptoms).
- It happened while sitting for a painful stimulus (tattoo/needle), a well-known situational trigger.
- Brief loss of consciousness with brief jerky limb movements (convulsive-looking myoclonic jerks are common in syncope).
- Rapid full recovery within 30 seconds and no post‑ictal confusion or focal deficits.
- Normal exam and stable vitals. An isolated incomplete right bundle branch block on ECG in a young person is usually benign.

What still needs to be done / when to worry
- Basic tests to exclude other causes: orthostatic vital signs, point-of-care glucose, routine bloodwork as indicated, pregnancy test if relevant. You already had an ECG; if there are any palpitations, exertional syncope, abnormal ECG, or family history of sudden death, further cardiac workup (echocardiogram, ambulatory rhythm monitor, or cardiology referral) would be needed.
- Consider neurological evaluation (EEG/neuroimaging) only if there are features suggestive of seizure: prolonged convulsion, prolonged confusion, tongue biting (especially lateral), urinary incontinence, or recurrent unexplained events.

Immediate self-care and prevention
- Stay hydrated, avoid prolonged standing, and try to recognize the prodrome (if you feel lightheaded, sit/lie down and put your head between your knees or lie flat).
- Counterpressure maneuvers (leg crossing and tensing, handgrip) can abort an impending faint.
- Avoid triggers (if needle/pain provokes you, tell providers so they can use distraction, local anesthetic, or lie you down).

When to seek urgent attention
- Any recurrent episodes, syncope during exertion, chest pain, shortness of breath, persistent neurologic deficits after an episode, or new concerning ECG findings.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia D. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia E. Asymptomatic multiple myeloma,D,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (or the node‑predominant form, small lymphocytic lymphoma).

Why this fits
- Typical presentation for CLL: older adult, often asymptomatic and discovered on routine labs/physical (generalized adenopathy).  
- Blood findings match: marked lymphocytosis made up of small, mature-appearing lymphocytes on smear (CLL characteristically shows small lymphocytes and often “smudge” cells).  
- Mild anemia with normal platelets is consistent with early/mid CLL; thrombocytopenia usually appears later if marrow is heavily involved.

How it is confirmed
- Flow cytometry on peripheral blood to demonstrate a monoclonal B‑cell population with the typical immunophenotype: CD19+, CD20 (dim), CD5+, CD23+, and light‑chain restriction (kappa or lambda).  
- Additional tests for staging/prognosis: FISH for del(13q), del(11q), del(17p)/TP53, trisomy 12; beta-2 microglobulin; baseline CMP. Bone‑marrow biopsy is not always required up front if flow cytometry is diagnostic.

Next steps and management overview
- Arrange prompt hematology/oncology referral for confirmation and staging (Rai or Binet).  
- If confirmed and you are asymptomatic with early-stage disease, the standard approach is careful observation (“watchful waiting”) rather than immediate treatment.  
- Treatment is indicated for symptomatic disease, progressive cytopenias, bulky lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly, or high‑risk genetic features; modern therapies include BTK inhibitors (e.g., ibrutinib), BCL2 inhibitors (venetoclax), and anti‑CD20 antibodies (rituximab/obinutuzumab).  
- Because CLL impairs immune function, vaccination review and infection monitoring are important; discuss immunoglobulin testing if recurrent infections.

When to seek urgent care
- New fevers, rapidly enlarging nodes, night sweats/weight loss, marked bleeding, or rapidly dropping blood counts.

- Initial pancreatitis care: aggressive IV fluids, bowel rest (NPO), pain control, monitor/support organ function and treat underlying cause (look for gallstones, alcohol, hypertriglyceridemia, drugs).  
- For the pseudocyst: small and asymptomatic → observation and repeat imaging; symptomatic, enlarging, infected, or persistent (>6 weeks or >6 cm often) → drainage. Preferred drainage options include endoscopic cystogastrostomy with stenting, percutaneous drainage, or surgical drainage depending on anatomy and expertise.  
- If you haven’t already, follow up with a gastroenterologist/hepatopancreatobiliary service and get evaluation for the cause of your pancreatitis and for appropriate timing/route of pseudocyst management.

If you want, tell me timing of the CT (how long after your hospitalization) and whether lab tests (amylase/lipase), ultrasound/ERCP results, or symptoms (fever, growing mass, persistent pain) were present — I can give more specific recommendations.",Pancreatic pseudocyst,False,True,True,True,True

My blood pressure was low at 90/59 mm Hg.

During my treatment, I received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. Shortly after the transfusion began, specifically around 5 to 10 minutes later, I started to feel chills and experienced pain in my lower back. I also noticed a decrease in my urine output. My vital signs changed; my pulse increased to 118 beats per minute, my respiratory rate decreased slightly to 19 breaths per minute, and my temperature rose to 38°C (100.4°F). My blood pressure dropped further to 60/40 mm Hg.

These symptoms prompted further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of my condition.",A. Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction B. Anaphylactic transfusion reaction C. Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction D. Transfusion-associated sepsis E. Transfusion-related acute lung injury,A,Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: acute (intravascular) hemolytic transfusion reaction due to ABO incompatibility.

Why: the reaction began within minutes of starting RBCs and produced classic signs of massive intravascular hemolysis — fever/chills, new hypotension and tachycardia, back/flank pain (renal/ureteral/hemoglobinuria pain), decreased urine output — all consistent with rapid complement‑mediated RBC destruction with hemoglobinuria and possible acute tubular injury/DIC.

Key pathophysiology: recipient IgM (or IgG activating complement) against donor RBC antigens → complement activation → intravascular hemolysis → free hemoglobin in plasma/urine, hemoglobinuria → acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, DIC, shock.

Important immediate actions (do these now if still ongoing)
- Stop the transfusion immediately; keep IV line open with normal saline.
- Notify the blood bank and your clinical team.
- Return blood bag and tubing to blood bank per protocol.
- Send patient blood samples for type & cross, direct antiglobulin test (DAT/Coombs), CBC, CMP (creatinine, K+), bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobin, coagulation studies, and urinalysis/urine hemoglobin.
- Aggressive IV fluids to preserve renal perfusion/urine output; give vasopressors if hypotension persists.
- Monitor urine output; consider diuretics (or mannitol) to maintain urine and urgent dialysis if severe AKI or hyperkalemia develops.
- Treat DIC/supportive care as indicated; admit to ICU.

Along with this pain, I have had several episodes of diarrhea, the most recent of which was bloody. These symptoms began to appear gradually but have worsened recently. As a result of these ongoing issues, I have noticed significant weight loss.

Additionally, I have a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which has been challenging to manage. During my recent check-up, my vital signs were recorded, showing a blood pressure of 100/70 mm Hg, a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8 °F), and a pulse rate of 95 beats per minute.

Given the combination of my symptoms and medical history, I am seeking clarification on the most likely diagnosis for my condition.",A. Gastroenteritis B. Ischemic bowel disease C. Ulcerative colitis D. Small bowel obstruction E. Acute pancreatitis,B,Ischemic bowel disease,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: chronic mesenteric ischemia (intestinal angina) — likely from mesenteric vascular compromise (atherosclerotic disease or SLE-associated vasculitis/thrombosis) with ischemic colitis.

Why this fits:
- Classic pattern of post‑prandial, diffuse abdominal pain that causes food‑fear and marked weight loss.
- “Severe pain out of proportion to exam” with only mild abdominal tenderness is characteristic of intestinal ischemia.
- Episodes of bloody diarrhea can reflect ischemic injury to bowel (ischemic colitis).
- Your history of poorly controlled SLE increases risk of vasculitis and thrombotic events affecting mesenteric vessels.

Immediate next steps (urgent):
- Obtain CT angiography (CTA) of the abdomen (mesenteric vessels) — best initial imaging to look for arterial stenosis/occlusion.
- Labs: CBC, metabolic panel, serum lactate, coagulation studies; stool studies if infectious cause suspected.
- Vascular surgery or interventional radiology consult (mesenteric angiography and possible revascularization) if imaging suggests ischemia.
- If acute ischemia is suspected or lactate is rising/clinical status worsens, urgent management (anticoagulation if thrombosis, possible embolectomy/revascularization, or surgery for infarcted bowel) is required.

Differential diagnoses include inflammatory bowel disease and infectious colitis, but the post‑prandial pain, weight loss, and pain severity relative to exam strongly point to mesenteric ischemia.

191,"I am a 51-year-old woman who recently visited the emergency department due to an aggressive cough that has persisted for about 11 years. This cough often produces copious amounts of thick, foamy, yellow-green sputum. I have experienced exacerbations similar to this one over the years, and I notice that the cough tends to worsen in the morning.

Throughout this time, I have sought medical attention multiple times for recurrent bouts of bronchitis, which have required antibiotic treatment. I do not smoke. During my examination, my blood pressure was recorded at 125/78 mm Hg, my pulse rate was 80 beats per minute, my respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and my temperature was 36.7°C (98.0°F). 

The doctor listened to my chest and noted crackles and wheezing in the right middle lobe, while the rest of the physical examination results appeared normal. A chest X-ray was performed, revealing irregular opacities in the right middle lobe and diffuse airway thickening. These findings, combined with my medical history, have led to further discussions regarding a potential diagnosis.",A. Tuberculosis B. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency C. Bronchiectasis D. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease E. Chronic bronchitis,C,Bronchiectasis,neutral,"Your history (11 years of daily, copious purulent sputum; recurrent “bronchitis” requiring antibiotics; worse in the morning; focal crackles/wheeze in the right middle lobe; chest x‑ray with RML opacities and diffuse airway thickening) is most suggestive of bronchiectasis, particularly localized bronchiectasis of the right middle lobe. Bronchiectasis is characterized by permanently dilated airways that trap mucus and lead to recurrent infections and large-volume purulent sputum.

What to do next (reasonable and commonly recommended steps)
- Get a high-resolution chest CT (HRCT). This is the diagnostic test: it will show bronchial dilation, airway wall thickening, and loss of normal bronchial tapering.
- Obtain sputum for Gram stain, routine culture (and sensitivity), and mycobacterial culture (NTM) before giving antibiotics if possible.
- Pulmonary function testing to assess airflow obstruction and baseline lung function.
- Basic workup for underlying causes if CT confirms bronchiectasis: serum immunoglobulins, testing for cystic fibrosis if clinically indicated, alpha‑1 antitrypsin level, and testing for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (total IgE, Aspergillus IgE) as appropriate.
- Refer to a pulmonologist and consider ENT evaluation if chronic sinus disease is present.

Initial management measures
- Airway clearance techniques (chest physiotherapy, devices, or pulmonary rehab) to help clear sputum.
- Treat acute exacerbations with culture-directed antibiotics; if frequent exacerbations, long‑term macrolide therapy (e.g., azithromycin) may be considered by a specialist.
- Inhaled bronchodilators if there is reversible obstruction; inhaled hypertonic saline or mucolytics for sputum mobilization in select patients.
- Routine vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcal).

When to consider surgery
- If bronchiectasis is truly localized to the right middle lobe and you have repeated, refractory infections despite optimal medical therapy, surgical resection can be considered by a thoracic surgeon/pulmonologist.

192,"I am a 35-year-old man who experienced shortness of breath while playing football with friends. This episode began about an hour into the game. I have had similar instances in the past that required emergency care. 

Upon arriving at the emergency room, my body temperature was recorded at 37.2°C, with a pulse rate of 100 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. My blood pressure was measured at 110/60 mm Hg. The examination revealed decreased breath sounds on both sides. My peak expiratory flow rate was 200 L/min, and my oxygen saturation was at 89% while breathing room air.

The medical team initiated treatment with nebulization using a short-acting β-agonist. I was also given oxygen via a mask. After oxygen administration, my oxygen levels improved, with a recorded partial pressure of oxygen increasing to 75 mm Hg. 

I am aware that my condition often leads to hospital visits, and I am seeking to understand the underlying cause of these episodes of shortness of breath.",A. Asthma attack B. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning C. Atelectasis D. Neuromuscular disease E. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),A,Asthma attack,neutral,"Most likely you have bronchial asthma — specifically exercise‑induced bronchospasm on a background of recurrent asthma. The key clues are:
- Recurrent, activity‑triggered shortness of breath
- Decreased breath sounds and a low peak expiratory flow (200 L/min, well below expected for an adult male)
- Hypoxaemia (SpO2 89%) that improved with bronchodilator nebulisation and oxygen
- Good acute response to a short‑acting β2‑agonist (typical for reversible airway obstruction)

What’s happening: asthma causes chronic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. On trigger (exercise, allergen, viral illness), airways constrict, mucus increases and airflow is limited — producing wheeze, reduced peak flow and low oxygen levels. The reversibility with a bronchodilator supports the diagnosis.

Suggested next steps:
- Arrange outpatient spirometry with bronchodilator testing to confirm diagnosis and measure severity.
- Start or optimize controller therapy (inhaled corticosteroid ± long‑acting bronchodilator) if asthma is confirmed, and continue a short‑acting β2‑agonist for rescue.
- Consider allergy testing and asthma action plan (including peak flow targets) to reduce future ER visits.
- Seek urgent care if you develop severe breathlessness, worsening hypoxaemia, difficulty speaking, confusion, or signs of exhaustion despite treatment.

Acute myeloid leukemia B. Aplastic anemia C. Chronic myelogenous leukemia D. Hairy cell leukemia E. Primary myelofibrosis,A,Acute myeloid leukemia,neutral,"Thank you — this sounds concerning and warranting prompt hematology evaluation. Based on your history and exam, here are the most likely explanations, what should be done next, and what to watch for.

Most likely causes (in order of likelihood)
- Progression of your myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with worsening bone‑marrow failure causing anemia and thrombocytopenia. This explains the pallor and petechiae.
- Transformation of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) — MDS can evolve to AML and that often presents with fatigue, weight loss, new lymphadenopathy, and cytopenias.
- Less likely: a new lymphoproliferative disorder (lymphoma or leukemia) or bone‑marrow infiltration by another malignancy or severe viral infection. Aspirin can worsen bleeding/bruising but would not explain anemia or new lymphadenopathy.

Why these fit your findings
- Pale conjunctivae = anemia. Severe fatigue over weeks is typical of significant anemia.
- Petechiae on the palate and lower extremities suggests a low platelet count (often very low, e.g. <20–30 ×10^9/L).
- New, bilateral painless cervical lymphadenopathy is more typical of hematologic malignancy than of simple iron deficiency or medication effects.
- Your prior diagnosis of MDS increases the risk that the marrow function has worsened or transformed.

Key tests you should get urgently
- Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count (urgent).
- Peripheral blood smear (looking for blasts, abnormal cells, platelet number/appearance).
- Reticulocyte count, iron studies, B12/folate if anemia is present.
- Basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, LDH, uric acid (baseline and to assess tumor burden).
- Coagulation tests (PT/INR, aPTT) if there is active bleeding.
- Viral testing as clinically indicated (HIV, EBV, CMV).
- Most important: bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics/molecular testing to determine whether MDS has progressed or transformed to AML or another marrow disorder.
- Imaging (CT neck/chest/abdomen ± PET) to evaluate the lymph nodes and look for splenomegaly or other disease sites if lymphoma/lymphadenopathy is prominent.

Immediate practical steps
- Stop aspirin until platelet count is known and you’ve discussed with your physician (aspirin increases bleeding risk).
- Avoid NSAIDs, invasive procedures, or activities with bleeding risk until platelet status is clarified.
- Arrange urgent hematology referral (same day or within 24–48 hours depending on local practice) — if blood counts are very abnormal you should be seen urgently.
- Transfusion support (red cells or platelets) may be needed if you are symptomatic or counts are dangerously low — hematology will advise.

When to seek emergency care now
- New or worsening bleeding (especially oral bleeding, large bruises, black/tarry stools, vomit with blood)
- New shortness of breath, chest pain, collapse, high fever, or sudden marked weakness
If any of these occur go to the ER immediately.

194,"I am an 8-year-old boy, and I was taken to the emergency department about three hours after experiencing a concerning episode at school. While I was in class, I had a two-minute incident where my right arm moved violently and jerkily. During this time, I was sweating a lot, but I did not lose consciousness. Before the episode began, I felt a chill run down my spine.

After the jerking stopped, I noticed that my right arm felt weak, and I couldn't lift it above my head for about two hours. A few weeks prior to this incident, I had a sore throat, which went away after I took some over-the-counter medicine.

I was born at term, and my mom recalls that I had a similar episode of jerky movements when I was a toddler and had a high fever. There is no significant family history of illnesses, although my father passed away in a car accident about a year ago.

Focal seizure,E,Focal seizure,neutral,"Thanks for describing exactly what happened — that helps a lot. Based on your story, the most likely thing is:

Probable diagnosis
- A focal (partial) seizure affecting the part of the brain controlling your right arm. The jerking of the right arm for about two minutes, the chill down your spine beforehand (an “aura”), staying awake during the event, and the temporary weakness in the same arm afterward all fit this pattern.
- The arm weakness that lasted a couple of hours is very likely Todd’s paralysis — a temporary weakness that can follow a focal seizure and usually gets better on its own (often within hours, sometimes up to 48 hours).

Why this fits
- The seizure only involved one arm and you did not lose consciousness: that points to a focal seizure.
- Normal physical exam and blood tests are reassuring and make things like a metabolic cause less likely.
- Having had a febrile seizure as a toddler doesn’t necessarily mean you have epilepsy now; many children with one febrile seizure do fine long-term.

Next steps (what your parents and doctors will likely do)
- See a pediatric neurologist for evaluation.
- Have an EEG (brain electrical activity test) to look for seizure activity or an area that’s likely to produce seizures.
- Have a brain MRI to rule out any structural cause (for example, a small scar, malformation, or other lesion) that might explain a focal seizure.
- Whether you start seizure medicine depends on the EEG/MRI results and on whether another seizure happens. Many kids do not start daily medicine after a single unprovoked seizure.

Safety and what to do if it happens again
- Seizure first aid: stay calm, protect the head, put something soft under the head, turn the person on their side if possible, don’t put anything in their mouth, don’t hold them down.
- Call for emergency help if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, if breathing is very hard or stops, if another seizure starts right away, or if the child is injured or doesn’t wake up normally afterwards.
- Avoid swimming or bathing alone, climbing unsupervised, and let school staff know so they can act safely if another event happens.

About the sore throat and history
- A sore throat weeks ago is unlikely to be the cause. Sydenham chorea (a rare movement problem after strep throat) looks different (random, dance-like movements) and is not the same as a focal seizure.
- The childhood febrile seizure is common and doesn’t necessarily mean you will have epilepsy, though it slightly increases the chance compared with children who never had a febrile seizure.

Sigmoid tumor,E,Sigmoid tumor,neutral,"Most likely you have an acute large‑bowel obstruction (LBO), probably due to a colonic lesion (classically a sigmoid carcinoma given your month‑long change in stool caliber). The upright and supine abdominal radiographs are used to distinguish small‑bowel from large‑bowel obstruction and to look for free air (perforation).

What those films would typically show if this is an LBO
- Marked, peripheral dilation of the colon (usually >6 cm in the colon; cecum at highest risk if >9 cm).  
- Haustral markings that do not cross the entire lumen (contrast with valvulae conniventes of small bowel).  
- An abrupt cutoff of colonic gas at the site of obstruction (often seen as transition point).  
- On the upright film: few air‑fluid levels in the colon; on the supine film: diffuse gas‑filled, dilated colon with little or no gas distal to the obstruction.  
- Upright film will also be used to look for free intraperitoneal air under the diaphragm (if perforation), which you do not have clinically at present.

How that differs from small‑bowel obstruction (for comparison)
- SBO: centrally located, multiple dilated small‑bowel loops with valvulae conniventes crossing the lumen and multiple stacked air‑fluid levels on upright film. Prior surgery (appendectomy) can cause adhesions and SBO, but your progressive change in stool caliber favors a colonic lesion.

Recommended next steps
- Urgent CT abdomen/pelvis with IV (and oral if feasible) contrast to confirm level and cause, and to evaluate bowel viability.  
- NPO, IV fluids, electrolyte correction, nasogastric decompression if vomiting, and immediate surgical (or gastroenterology) consultation.  
- Definitive management will depend on CT findings (endoscopic decompression or urgent surgery if complete obstruction or ischemia).

- A new desquamative rash that began after starting trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP‑SMX) is most consistent with a drug eruption. Sulfonamides commonly cause morbilliform rashes and, less commonly, more serious reactions (fixed drug eruption, erythema multiforme, DRESS, Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis).

Immediate actions (do these now)
1. Stop TMP‑SMX immediately and do not take any more doses.
2. If you have any of the following go to the emergency department right away:
   - New or worsening blisters, widespread peeling/sloughing of skin, or mucous membrane involvement (mouth, eyes, genitals)
   - Fever, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, dizziness, or other systemic illness
   These are red flags for SJS/TEN or other severe drug reactions.

Information that will help make the diagnosis (please answer or bring to clinician)
- When did the rash start relative to the first TMP‑SMX dose?
- Is the rash itchy, painful, or spreading? Any blisters?
- Any mouth, eye, or genital lesions?
- Any fever, chills, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, facial swelling, or breathing problems?
- Any prior reactions to sulfa drugs or other antibiotics? Any HIV, autoimmune disease, or other new medications?

What the urgent care / clinician will likely do next
- Stop the suspected drug.
- Perform or review labs: CBC with differential, basic metabolic panel (kidney function), liver tests; possibly CRP/ESR, and eosinophil count if DRESS is suspected.
- Photograph the rash and consider dermatology referral and/or skin biopsy if uncertain or severe.
- Manage symptoms: topical emollients and topical steroids for localized rash; oral antihistamines for itching.
- If there is concern for SJS/TEN, transfer to hospital (often burn unit or ICU) for supportive care; specialized therapies may be considered.

Short-term symptomatic care if symptoms are mild and no red flags
- Keep skin moisturized, avoid irritants and tight clothing.
- Oral antihistamines (e.g., cetirizine or diphenhydramine at night) for itch.
- Short course of topical low-to-mid potency steroid for inflamed areas if advised by clinician.

Longer-term
- Do not take sulfonamide antibiotics in the future until the reaction is evaluated and classified by a clinician/dermatologist. Document the allergy in your medical record.

- Diagnostic test of choice: contrast esophagography with a water‑soluble contrast agent (Gastrografin swallow). If that is negative but suspicion remains high, follow with a thin barium study or chest CT.
- Contrast-enhanced chest CT is also highly sensitive and often done in the ED to evaluate mediastinal air and guide management.

200,"I am a 47-year-old man who recently visited the emergency department due to experiencing urinary and fecal incontinence for the past six hours. Earlier that day, I had fallen at my construction site and sustained injuries to my back and thighs, but I did not seek medical attention at that time. To manage my lower back pain, I took ibuprofen.

Upon arriving at the emergency department, my vital signs were taken, and I was found to have a temperature of 36.9°C, a pulse of 80 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 132/84 mm Hg. During the examination, the doctor noted tenderness over my lumbar spine and weakness in both lower extremities. They observed absent ankle jerk reflexes, while my patellar reflexes were still present. Additionally, I had decreased rectal tone, and an ultrasound of my bladder indicated that it was full.

Given these findings, the medical team began to consider potential diagnoses related to my condition.","A. Spinal epidural abscess B. Cerebellar stroke C. Cauda equina syndrome D. Conus medullaris syndrome E. Anterior spinal cord syndrome F. Brown-Sequard syndrome
""",D,Conus medullaris syndrome,neutral,"The presentation is highly suspicious for cauda equina syndrome (CES), an emergency caused by compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots.

Why CES fits:
- Acute urinary retention (full bladder on scan) and fecal incontinence with decreased rectal tone indicate S2–S4 nerve root involvement.
- Bilateral lower‑extremity weakness and absent ankle reflexes (S1) with preserved patellar reflexes (L3–L4) localize the problem to the cauda equina rather than a more rostral spinal cord lesion.
- Recent traumatic fall with lumbar tenderness provides a plausible cause (large central disc herniation, fracture with retropulsion, or hematoma).

Key immediate actions (urgent):
- Emergency MRI of the lumbar spine now (or CT myelogram if MRI unavailable) to identify the site/cause of compression.
- Immediate neurosurgery/spine consult — surgical decompression (eg, laminectomy/discectomy) is typically required urgently; outcomes are much better if decompression occurs promptly (ideally within 24–48 hours).
- Urinary catheterization to decompress bladder and measure post‑void residual.
- Document thorough neurologic exam (saddle anesthesia, motor/sensory levels) and times of symptom onset.
- Basic labs and perioperative clearance as indicated; analgesia and immobilization as needed.

Differential to consider:
- Conus medullaris syndrome (more symmetrical, early sphincter loss, often mixed upper and lower motor signs) — less likely given the preserved knee reflexes and absent ankle jerks.
- Traumatic vertebral fracture with nerve root compression.
- Less likely: peripheral neuropathy alone, spinal cord transection (would usually give upper motor neuron signs), or noncompressive causes.

Bottom line: This is potentially cauda equina syndrome and requires immediate MRI and neurosurgical evaluation. If you haven’t already, tell the ED team that you’re concerned about CES and ask for urgent spine imaging and surgical review. If you want, tell me what the MRI shows and I can help interpret it.",Conus medullaris syndrome,False,False,False,False,False
201,"I am a 22-year-old female software analyst who visited a medical clinic to evaluate some symptoms I had been experiencing. For the past two months, I noticed tingling and numbness in both of my hands. These sensations tend to worsen by the end of my workday, but I typically do not feel them on my days off.

I have been living with type I diabetes for the past two years, and I manage my condition with insulin. During my visit, I mentioned that I have been sexually active, but I have also been experiencing irregular periods for the last three months. To address the possibility of pregnancy, a urine pregnancy test was conducted, and the result came back negative.

I am seeking to understand what might be causing the tingling and numbness in my hands, especially considering my diabetes and the other health factors I described.",A. Hypothyroidism B. Acute intermittent porphyria C. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis D. Diabetic neuropathy E. Multiple sclerosis,A,Hypothyroidism,neutral,"Most likely cause: carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve compression).
- Why: your symptoms are bilateral, worse by the end of a workday doing repetitive hand/wrist tasks (software/keyboard use), which is classic for carpal tunnel. Typical CTS causes numbness/tingling in the thumb, index, middle and radial half of the ring finger, and may be worse with sustained wrist flexion/extension or at night.

Other possibilities
- Diabetic peripheral neuropathy: possible but less likely as an isolated early-hand symptom. Diabetic neuropathy usually starts in the feet and is symmetric and persistent, not strongly linked to activity during the day. It becomes more likely with longer duration/poor glucose control.
- Cervical radiculopathy or brachial plexus problems: can cause arm/hand numbness but usually has neck pain or a different sensory pattern.
- Vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, uremic neuropathy, or other systemic causes — less likely but worth checking if exam or history suggests them.
- Less likely causes: thoracic outlet syndrome, inflammatory neuropathies, compressive lesions.

What to do next
1. Clinic exam: provider will check the sensory distribution (median nerve territory), muscle strength (thenar muscles), reflexes, and perform Phalen’s and Tinel’s tests. This can often distinguish CTS from generalized neuropathy or radiculopathy.
2. Basic tests to consider:
   - HbA1c (to assess diabetes control)
   - Bloodwork if indicated: TSH, vitamin B12, renal function/electrolytes
3. If exam is consistent with CTS or if diagnosis is uncertain: referral for nerve conduction studies/EMG to confirm and grade severity.
4. Initial conservative measures you can start now:
   - Neutral wrist splinting at night (and during work if helpful)
   - Frequent short breaks, ergonomic keyboard/mouse setup, keep wrists neutral
   - Avoid prolonged wrist flexion; do gentle nerve/gliding stretches as advised by a therapist
   - Over-the-counter NSAIDs for pain (if appropriate)
5. If conservative care fails or there is progressive weakness/thenar atrophy: refer to hand surgery for steroid injection or surgical release.

Red flags — seek prompt care if you develop progressive hand weakness, difficulty buttoning/typing, muscle wasting in the thumb area, or spreading numbness.

If you’d like, tell me whether the numbness is concentrated in the thumb/index/middle fingers or more diffuse, whether you wake at night from numbness, and how your blood sugars/HbA1c have been — that will help narrow the likelihood of carpal tunnel versus diabetic neuropathy.",Hypothyroidism,False,False,False,False,False

Based on what you’ve told me, the most likely possibilities for a week of progressive unilateral eye pain without motility problems or major systemic illness are:

- Herpes simplex keratitis — classically causes unilateral pain, photophobia, and a dendritic corneal ulcer on fluorescein exam. Corneal sensation may be reduced.  
- Bacterial (contact-lens–associated) keratitis — severe pain, focal corneal infiltrate/ulcer and often purulent discharge; progresses quickly. (Important only if you wear contacts.)  
- Gonococcal acute conjunctivitis/keratitis — copious purulent discharge and rapid corneal involvement; consider given unprotected sex.  
- Noninfectious causes less likely given progressive pain (corneal abrasion, uveitis/iritis — typically with ciliary flush and photophobia; angle-closure glaucoma would usually have vision changes and a mid-dilated pupil).

What I need from you now
- Please upload the figure or describe what the clinicians documented (fluorescein staining/dendritic pattern, corneal opacity, discharge, eyelid swelling, pupil size/reactivity, visual acuity).  
- Tell me whether you wear contact lenses, have photophobia, eye discharge (and its character), any previous cold sores or genital herpes, or recent skin lesions.

Immediate advice
- If you have any sudden vision loss, worsening pain, marked redness, or a lot of purulent drainage, seek ophthalmology/ED care now.  
- Don’t put steroid eye drops in the affected eye unless prescribed by an ophthalmologist (can worsen HSV and bacterial infections).  
- If you haven’t already been evaluated with slit-lamp/fluorescein exam, you should be seen by eye care urgently.

203,"I am a 17-year-old rugby player, and I recently experienced an injury during a game. While running, I rolled my ankle, which caused me to limp into the emergency room for evaluation. The medical staff assessed my injury and noted that the mechanism of injury involved both ankle plantar flexion and inversion. 

During the examination, they checked for point tenderness around the medial and lateral malleolus, but there was none present. They performed an anterior drawer test on my ankle, which returned a positive result, indicating some instability. However, the talar tilt test was negative, suggesting that certain ligamentous structures were intact. 

Based on these findings, the medical team concluded that I likely sustained a specific type of ankle injury, although the exact nature of the injury was not detailed in the conversation. Overall, the experience left me concerned about my recovery and the impact this injury might have on my ability to play rugby in the future.",A. Anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) sprain B. Calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) sprain C. Deltoid ligament sprain D. Tibia fracture E. Fibula fracture,A,Anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) sprain,neutral,"What this most likely is
- Your mechanism (plantarflexion + inversion) plus a positive anterior drawer and a negative talar tilt pretty much point to an acute lateral ankle sprain — specifically damage to the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL).  
- A positive anterior drawer test = ATFL laxity/partial tear; a negative talar tilt suggests the calcaneofibular ligament is intact. No point tenderness over the malleoli lowers the likelihood of an ankle fracture (Ottawa rules).

What that means for recovery
- Most isolated ATFL sprains in young athletes do well with non‑operative treatment. Expect roughly:
  - Mild (sprain/stretch): days–2 weeks
  - Moderate (partial tear): ~2–6 weeks
  - Severe (complete tear with instability): 6+ weeks, sometimes longer and possibly surgery if instability persists
- Given your exam (positive drawer, intact talar tilt) you likely sit in the mild–moderate (grade II) range — full recovery and return to rugby is very common with proper rehab.

Immediate steps and short-term care
- Protect and reduce swelling (first 48–72 hours): relative rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE). Avoid prolonged immobilization.
- Use a supportive brace or lace-up boot for a short period (days–2 weeks) if painful or unstable.
- Begin pain‑guided range of motion and then progressive strengthening ASAP — early controlled mobility speeds recovery.

Rehabilitation and return to play
- Start physiotherapy early for:
  - ROM, progressive strengthening (peroneals, calf), proprioception/balance, and sport‑specific agility drills.
- Return-to-play criteria (typical):
  - Pain-free running and cutting, symmetric ankle ROM and strength (near 90–100% vs uninjured side), ability to do sport-specific drills and pass single‑leg hop tests without instability or apprehension.
- Use external support (taping or brace) for your first games back and during a season if you’ve had prior sprains — this reduces reinjury risk.

When to get further testing or specialist input
- If you can’t bear weight immediately, have persistent swelling/pain, numbness, or bony tenderness over the malleoli → get x‑rays.  
- If instability or pain persists despite good rehab (weeks–months), see sports medicine/orthopedics; MRI can assess ligament extent and look for cartilage or other injuries. Surgical repair (e.g., Broström) is considered for chronic mechanical instability.

Practical reassurance
- At 17 and with proper supervised rehab, prognosis for returning to rugby is very good. Follow your physio plan, be cautious with early return, and use a brace/taping early on to lower the chance of recurrence.

Why: maternal virilization during pregnancy + a 46,XX infant with ambiguous/virilized external genitalia at birth is classic for fetal placental aromatase deficiency (placenta can’t convert androgens to estrogens). Lack of estrogen explains absent breast development (Tanner I), tall stature and recurrent low‑trauma fractures (failure of epiphyseal closure and low bone mass). Ovarian cysts/polycystic appearance result from excess gonadotropin stimulation of androgen‑producing ovaries; peripheral/high androgen levels account for acne and clitoromegaly.

Key next steps
- Labs: karyotype to confirm 46,XX, serum estradiol (low), testosterone and androstenedione (high), DHEA‑S, LH/FSH.  
- Genetic testing for CYP19A1 (aromatase) mutation.  
- Bone density (DEXA) to assess osteoporosis.  
- Refer to pediatric/endocrine specialists, gynecology and genetics.

Treatment principles
- Start estrogen replacement (pubertal induction with physiologic estrogen dosing) to develop breasts, close epiphyses appropriately, reduce gonadotropin drive and protect bone. Treatment should be supervised by a pediatric/endocrine team.  
- Surgical options for genital appearance can be discussed with gynecology/urology if desired.  
- Continue contraception counseling (isotretinoin is teratogenic — strict pregnancy prevention program if retained).

Migraine headache E. Hypertensive emergency F. Transient ischemic attack G. Giant cell arteritis
""",E,Hypertensive emergency,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Hypertensive emergency (malignant hypertension) with acute target‑organ injury — evidence: very high BP (185/110) plus acute headache, visual disturbance and bilateral papilledema. The nausea/vomiting and visual symptoms can reflect hypertensive encephalopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).

Why this matters
- Papilledema indicates raised intracranial pressure/acute end‑organ damage and makes this an emergency that requires urgent, controlled BP lowering and inpatient management.

Immediate management (what I would expect the ED/ICU team to do right away)
1. Admit to monitored setting (ED resuscitation area or ICU) with continuous BP and neurological monitoring.
2. Start controlled IV antihypertensive therapy (do not give rapid‑acting oral nifedipine). Typical first‑line options:
   - IV nicardipine infusion (easy titration) or
   - IV labetalol (bolus ± infusion).
   - Sodium nitroprusside or fenoldopam are alternatives if needed.
3. BP targets: reduce mean arterial pressure by no more than ~25% in the first hour, then aim for ~160/100–110 mm Hg over the next 2–6 hours (unless a different target is indicated by stroke/MI protocols).
4. Urgent neuroimaging: noncontrast head CT to exclude intracranial hemorrhage; MRI (with FLAIR) if PRES is suspected.
5. Obtain/monitor labs: repeat basic metabolic panel (creatinine), urinalysis (quantify protein, look for hematuria), ECG and troponin, CBC, consider urine albumin/creatinine ratio. Monitor urine output and electrolytes while treating.
6. Consult neurology and ophthalmology (for papilledema/visual loss) and involve nephrology if renal injury or heavy proteinuria is confirmed.
7. Avoid overly rapid BP lowering (risk of cerebral/renal ischemia). Reassess neuro status frequently.

Longer‑term considerations
- After stabilization, reassess antihypertensive regimen and adherence; escalate chronic BP control with oral agents once stabilized.
- Evaluate for secondary causes of severe HTN if clinically indicated.
- Smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, glucose control, and routine follow-up with primary care/cardiology.

Ulcerative colitis G. Diverticulitis,G,Diverticulitis,neutral,"Thanks — this presentation most strongly suggests acute left‑sided colonic pathology, with the leading diagnosis being acute sigmoid diverticulitis. Reasoning:
- Localized constant LLQ pain, fever, nausea/vomiting, and recent diarrhea in a patient with intermittent constipation fit typical diverticulitis.
- Absence of guarding/rebound and relatively short symptom duration favor an uncomplicated process, but fever and significant pain could still justify urgent workup.

Other important differentials
- Infectious gastroenteritis
- Ischemic colitis (risk increased by HTN/DM)
- Inflammatory bowel disease flare
- Ovarian/testicular or gynecologic pathology (if applicable)
- Ureteral stone with referred pain
- Constipation with colonic obstruction / sigmoid volvulus (given constipation history)

Recommended next steps in the ED
- Targeted tests:
  - CBC with differential (look for leukocytosis)
  - Basic metabolic panel (for hydration/renal function)
  - CRP (if available) and lactate if concerned for ischemia or sepsis
  - Urinalysis (to exclude urinary source)
  - Pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential
  - Blood cultures if febrile and systemically ill
- Imaging:
  - CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast (and oral/rectal contrast per local protocol) — best test to confirm diverticulitis and to look for complications (abscess, perforation, fistula, obstruction).
- Initial treatment while workup is pending:
  - IV fluids if dehydrated or vomiting
  - Analgesia (e.g., IV acetaminophen and/or opioids as needed)
  - Antiemetic for nausea
  - NPO until imaging if severe pain or concern for complication
  - Antibiotics: if CT confirms uncomplicated diverticulitis and the patient is low risk, recent evidence allows selective nonuse of antibiotics; however, given fever, moderate pain, diabetes, and ED presentation, many clinicians would start empiric broad‑spectrum IV antibiotics and admit or observe until imaging results (e.g., a beta‑lactam/beta‑lactamase inhibitor or ciprofloxacin + metronidazole per local guidelines).
- Consult surgery if CT shows complications (abscess, perforation, peritonitis, obstruction) or if clinical deterioration.

Disposition guidance
- Uncomplicated diverticulitis, stable, tolerating oral intake, adequate social support: possible outpatient management with close follow‑up (some clinicians prescribe oral antibiotics; others do not).
- Admit for IV antibiotics, observation, or surgery if: peritonitis, high fever/marked leukocytosis, immunosuppression (diabetes increases risk), inability to tolerate oral intake, severe pain, or CT evidence of complication.

Red flags that warrant immediate re-evaluation or admission
- Worsening or diffuse abdominal pain, rigors, persistent high fever, inability to tolerate oral intake, syncope/dizziness, signs of sepsis, bloody stools, or peritoneal signs on exam.

- Any prior episodes of similar pain or known diverticulosis
- Bowel movement pattern immediately prior to ED visit (obstructive symptoms)
- Current medications beyond those listed (steroids, immunosuppressants)
- Recent weight loss, change in bowel habits, or rectal bleeding

Retinal vein occlusion B. Retinal detachment C. Acute angle closure glaucoma D. CMV retinitis E. HSV retinitis,D,CMV retinitis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. In people with AIDS and CD4 counts <50, CMV is the most common cause of painless progressive loss of central and peripheral vision. Fundoscopic findings classically include fluffy, yellow-white retinal lesions with hemorrhage (“pizza‑pie” or “brushfire” appearance).

Why this is most likely
- Your CD4 count of 42 and painless, progressive visual loss fit CMV retinitis. Other possibilities (HSV/VZV necrotizing retinitis, toxoplasma chorioretinitis, HIV retinopathy) are less likely but can look similar; an urgent ophthalmology exam helps differentiate.

What needs to happen now
1. Urgent ophthalmology referral (same day or within 24–48 hours). CMV retinitis is an ophthalmic emergency.
2. Start antiviral therapy promptly if CMV retinitis is confirmed or strongly suspected:
   - Oral valganciclovir is commonly used (induction 900 mg twice daily for ~21 days, then maintenance 900 mg daily), adjusted for renal function.
   - IV ganciclovir (e.g., 5 mg/kg IV q12h) or intravitreal ganciclovir injections may be used for severe or sight‑threatening disease. Foscarnet or cidofovir are alternatives for ganciclovir-resistant disease.
3. Reassess and optimize HIV care (restart/adjust antiretroviral therapy) in coordination with ID/HIV and ophthalmology — immune recovery reduces recurrent CMV but timing should be coordinated because of possible IRIS.
4. Baseline and monitoring labs: CBC (ganciclovir can cause neutropenia), renal function (dose adjustments; foscarnet nephrotoxic), and CMV PCR or ocular sampling if needed. Repeat CD4 and HIV viral load.

Prognosis and prevention
- Without treatment CMV retinitis often causes progressive visual loss and blindness. With prompt antiviral therapy vision can often be stabilized, though scarring may be permanent. Recurrence is common until CD4 counts recover (generally >100) on effective ART.

What’s true medically
- A reducible inguinal hernia that was easily pushed back and judged non‑urgent usually has a low short‑term risk of strangulation, which is why surgery was scheduled electively.
- Nonetheless there is always a small risk over time, so elective repair is reasonable.
- Urgent care is required if the hernia becomes incarcerated/strangulated (see red flags below).

Clear red flags that do require immediate ED care
Go to the ED right away if you have any of:
- A bulge that you cannot push back in (irreducible/incarcerated hernia)
- Severe, constant pain at the hernia site
- Nausea and vomiting
- Inability to pass gas or stool (bowel obstruction)
- Fever or increasing redness, warmth, or dark discoloration of the skin over the lump

How to reduce your anxiety and unnecessary visits
1. Create a “safety plan” with your surgeon/PCP
   - Ask for a single named contact (nurse/clinic phone) and an estimated timeline for surgery. Get written instructions about red flags and when to call/come in.
   - Request a preoperative phone check to confirm you’re on the list and what could change scheduling.

2. Limit reassurance‑seeking
   - Agree with yourself to call the clinic first (not ED) for non‑urgent questions, and only visit ED for red-flag symptoms above.
   - Keep a log when urges to go to ED arise (what you were thinking/feeling) — this helps reduce the urge over time.

3. Practical self-care for abdominal symptoms
   - Regular meals, fiber and hydration, exercise, and sleep hygiene often help bowel consistency and reduce sensations that trigger worry.
   - Track symptoms in a simple diary (time, foods, bowel movement, pain) to show your PCP — patterns often emerge.

4. Psychological treatments that work
   - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for health anxiety is the best-evidenced treatment: it teaches exposure to feared sensations, reduces checking and reassurance-seeking, and changes unhelpful thoughts.
   - Mindfulness, acceptance strategies, and behavioral experiments are also helpful.
   - If anxiety is severe or persistent, SSRIs (e.g., sertraline, fluoxetine) can be effective; discuss medication with your PCP or a psychiatrist.

5. Short-term coping techniques
   - Grounding/breathing: slow 4‑4‑6 breaths (inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 6s) for several minutes.
   - 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, etc.).
   - Distract with a planned activity for 30–60 minutes when worry spikes.

What you might do next
- Ask your surgeon/clinic for a written safety plan, estimated wait time, and a named contact.
- Book a referral for CBT (look for therapists experienced with health anxiety/illness anxiety or somatic symptom disorder).
- Talk with your PCP about whether a short trial of an SSRI or referral to psychiatry is appropriate.
- If you want, I can help you draft a short script to use when you call the clinic or ED, or a checklist of red flags and coping steps to carry with you.

You’re not “overreacting” — this is understandable given the physical symptom plus anxiety. With a concrete plan and targeted treatment (CBT ± medication), most people get much better and stop needing frequent reassurance.

211,"I am a 72-year-old man who was involved in a traffic collision. After the accident, I was transported to the emergency room by ambulance. Upon arrival, I was in shock and comatose. The medical team examined me and noted a heart rate of 60 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 70 over 40 mm Hg. Despite their resuscitative efforts, I did not survive.

Following my death, an autopsy was performed, which revealed multiple internal hemorrhages and signs of ischemic damage in my lungs, kidneys, and brain. The examination of my heart showed significant anomalies. The medical staff suggested that acute hypovolemia was likely the cause of the ischemic changes observed in my organs. However, they were also interested in understanding the underlying reason for the gross anomaly found in my heart.",A. Aortic valve regurgitation B. Mitral valve stenosis C. Senile calcific aortic stenosis D. Accumulation of amyloid in the myocardium E. Genetic mutation,C,Senile calcific aortic stenosis,neutral,"Most likely the gross cardiac finding was concentric left‑ventricular hypertrophy. The usual underlying reason for that appearance in an older person is long‑standing pressure overload — most commonly chronic systemic hypertension (or less commonly aortic stenosis). 

Pathophysiology in brief: persistent elevated afterload causes cardiomyocytes to add sarcomeres in parallel, producing a thickened ventricular wall with a smaller chamber and increased interstitial fibrosis. Microscopically you’d see enlarged myocytes with boxcar nuclei and fibrosis. Functionally this produces decreased ventricular compliance (diastolic dysfunction) and greater susceptibility to ischemia under stress (such as acute hypovolemia).",Senile calcific aortic stenosis,False,False,False,False,True
212,"I am a 45-year-old man who was brought to the emergency room by my wife due to confusion that had developed over the past day. Upon arrival, I was found to have a fever, with an oral temperature of 103.6 degrees Fahrenheit. My vital signs were otherwise stable. During the physical examination, the doctor noted some unusual lesions on my skin that I had never seen before. Additionally, I experienced subtle weakness on the right side of my body, which affected both my upper and lower extremities.

While in the emergency room, I underwent various tests. The healthcare team informed me that my blood counts were concerning, particularly my hemoglobin level, which was significantly low. They mentioned that both my PT/INR and PTT results were normal, which offered some reassurance. I was not aware of any previous health issues that could have led to my current state, and it was alarming to find myself experiencing these symptoms. The medical team was focused on determining the underlying cause of my condition, and I was waiting for further assessment and diagnosis.",A. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation C. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura D. Hemolytic uremic syndrome E. Evan's syndrome,C,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,neutral,"The combination of high fever, new confusion and a new focal neurologic deficit (right‑sided weakness), plus new unexplained skin lesions, strongly raises concern for a bloodstream infection with septic embolization—most classically infective endocarditis. In that scenario vegetations on a heart valve seed bacteria into the blood (causing fever and skin lesions such as Janeway lesions or splinter hemorrhages) and can embolize to the brain (causing focal deficits). Your normal PT/INR and PTT make disseminated intravascular coagulation less likely, but the low hemoglobin is important to evaluate (it may be chronic, due to inflammation or hemolysis, or less commonly related to acute blood loss).

What the team will or should do urgently
- Obtain blood cultures (ideally 3 sets from separate sites) before giving antibiotics.  
- Start empiric IV antibiotics promptly if sepsis/endocarditis is suspected (choices guided by local antibiogram and risk factors; infectious disease will direct this).  
- Urgent neuroimaging (noncontrast head CT initially, and MRI brain when feasible) to look for ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, or brain abscess.  
- Echocardiography: transthoracic (TTE) first, and transesophageal (TEE) if TTE is nondiagnostic or suspicion remains high. TEE is more sensitive for vegetations.  
- Blood tests: repeat CBC with differential and platelet count, blood chemistry, liver tests, inflammatory markers, blood bank type and crossmatch if transfusion may be needed. Evaluate hemolysis if suspected (reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, direct Coombs).  
- Urgent consultations: neurology (for focal deficit/stroke management) and infectious disease/cardiology (for endocarditis management and possible surgical evaluation).  
- If the skin lesions can be sampled (swab/biopsy), culture/histology may help identify the organism.

Other conditions to consider (less likely but important)
- Meningococcemia can cause fever, confusion and a petechial/purpuric rash, but often causes abnormal coagulation and very rapid deterioration.  
- Brain abscess/encephalitis from other sources can cause fever and focal deficits; the diagnostic steps above (imaging, cultures, LP only if safe) will help distinguish these.

Immediate priorities for you now
- Ensure blood cultures were drawn before antibiotics.  
- Make sure urgent CT/MRI and an echocardiogram are arranged.  
- Ask that neurology and infectious disease be involved.  
- If you have risk factors (recent dental work, IV drug use, prosthetic valves, indwelling catheters), tell the team—this influences likely organisms and treatment.

Tell your team about any prior anemia, recent procedures, dental infections or injections, and any medications (especially immunosuppressants).

213,"I am a 60-year-old woman who recently went to the emergency department because I had been experiencing progressive shortness of breath and a dry cough for the past week. I noticed that my symptoms worsened with physical activity but improved when I rested. 

Two years ago, I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, and I had just started regular dialysis treatment. When I arrived at the emergency department, my pulse rate was measured at 105 beats per minute, my blood pressure was 110 over 70 mm Hg, my respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, and my temperature was 37.8°C (100.0°F). 

During the respiratory examination, the doctor noted dullness on percussion, decreased vocal tactile fremitus, and decreased breath sounds over the base of my right lung. The remainder of the physical exam was normal. 

I am uncertain about the exact cause of my symptoms, but I am here seeking help for my condition.",A. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) B. Pleural effusion C. Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) D. Pneumonia E. Acute bronchitis,B,Pleural effusion,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: pleural effusion of the right lower hemithorax.

Why: the classic physical findings you describe—dullness to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus, and decreased breath sounds over the right base—are typical for fluid in the pleural space. Your progressive dyspnea and tachypnea also fit. In a patient on dialysis several causes are possible (see below).

Most important immediate next steps
- Get a chest x‑ray (upright with lateral decubitus if needed) or bedside thoracic ultrasound to confirm and estimate the size of the effusion. Ultrasound is most sensitive at the bedside.
- Because this is a new, unilateral effusion and you have fever and respiratory symptoms, diagnostic thoracentesis (removal of a sample of pleural fluid) is indicated unless the effusion is tiny and clearly due to volume overload. Fluid should be sent for cell count, Gram stain/culture, protein, LDH, glucose, pH and cytology so it can be classified by Light’s criteria and checked for infection or malignancy.
- If you are in respiratory distress or the effusion is large, therapeutic thoracentesis (removing larger volume to relieve symptoms) should be done urgently.

Likely causes to consider (given your history of chronic kidney disease on dialysis)
- Volume overload/transudative effusion from fluid retention (more often bilateral but can be asymmetric) — treat by intensifying dialysis/ultrafiltration and salt/water restriction.
- Parapneumonic effusion or empyema (exudate) associated with pneumonia — more likely when fever and cough are present; requires antibiotics and often drainage if complicated.
- Uremic pleuritis (exudative) — can occur in advanced CKD; diagnosed by pleural-fluid analysis and clinical context.
- Less likely but possible: pulmonary embolism, malignancy, or other inflammatory causes.

How results will guide treatment
- Transudate → treat underlying cause (optimize dialysis/volume status, treat heart failure).
- Exudate → evaluate for infection, malignancy, or inflammation. If infected or complicated parapneumonic effusion (low pH, low glucose, positive culture, or frank pus) you will need chest-tube drainage plus antibiotics.

Red flags — seek immediate care if you develop:
- Worsening shortness of breath, rapid breathing, lightheadedness, or blue lips/fingertips
- High fevers, severe chest pain, or coughing up blood

I recommend you have the chest x‑ray/ultrasound and a prompt thoracentesis arranged and follow up with the ED/pulmonology team so they can analyze the fluid and start the appropriate treatment.",Pneumonia,True,True,True,True,True
214,"I was taken to the physician for a follow-up examination after experiencing recurrent asthma attacks. My mother mentioned that I had been having mild abdominal pain for the past two weeks. At the time of the visit, I was using daily inhaled fluticasone and inhaled albuterol as needed for my asthma.

During the examination, the physician noted that I appeared well. My temperature was measured at 37°C, my pulse was 100 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was recorded at 130/85 mm Hg. The doctor listened to my lungs and found them clear, with no signs of murmurs, rubs, or gallops in my heart. 

When it came to my abdomen, the doctor found a smooth, nontender mass on the left side that did not cross the midline. The rest of the examination showed no abnormalities. The physician also reviewed some lab results, which indicated that my complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine were all within the reference range. 

Overall, I felt comfortable during the visit, but the physician was concerned about the abdominal mass and the ongoing mild pain.","A. Polycystic kidney disease B. Lymphoma C. Acute leukemia D. Wilms' tumor E. Neuroblastoma F. Renal cell carcinoma G. Ovarian cyst
""",D,Wilms' tumor,neutral,"A smooth, nontender, left-sided abdominal mass that doesn’t cross the midline is most consistent with an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) or a splenic lesion. Other possibilities (less likely given the exam) include a mass of the left kidney, tail-of-pancreas lesion, or an ovarian/colonic mass depending on sex and exact location — but the exam description strongly favors splenic involvement.

Recommended next steps
- Abdominal ultrasound as the initial imaging test to confirm spleen enlargement and characterize the mass (cystic vs solid) — fast, noninvasive, and widely available.  
- Basic targeted labs: peripheral smear (look for hemolysis or abnormal cells), reticulocyte count, bilirubin/haptoglobin/LDH if hemolysis is suspected, liver tests, and viral serologies (EBV/CMV) if infectious mononucleosis is a consideration. You already have a normal CBC and renal panel, which is helpful but not definitive.  
- Consider CT abdomen with contrast if ultrasound is inconclusive or suggests a solid mass/possible malignancy.  
- Referral to gastroenterology or hematology if splenomegaly is confirmed or if imaging shows a suspicious lesion.

Precautions
- Avoid contact sports or activities with high risk of abdominal trauma until the spleen is evaluated (risk of splenic rupture).  
- Seek urgent care if you develop sudden severe abdominal pain, lightheadedness, fainting, fevers, or signs of bleeding.

Left circumflex artery occlusion D. Left anterior descending artery occlusion E. Right main coronary artery occlusion,E,Right main coronary artery occlusion,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: acute myocardial infarction (an acute coronary syndrome due to ischemic myocardial injury from coronary atherosclerotic plaque rupture with thrombus). The elevated troponin plus classic ischemic chest pain (substernal pain radiating to neck/left arm) and known coronary disease strongly point to MI. Whether it is a STEMI or NSTEMI depends on the 12‑lead ECG:

- If the ECG shows new ST‑segment elevations in a coronary distribution → STEMI: requires immediate reperfusion (primary PCI ideally within 90 minutes, or fibrinolysis if PCI is not available promptly).  
- If the ECG shows no ST elevation but other ischemic changes (ST depression, T‑wave changes) → NSTEMI: treat with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy and risk‑stratify for early invasive angiography.

Typical immediate management (what ED/PCI teams will consider)
- Give chewable aspirin immediately (unless contraindicated). Start a P2Y12 inhibitor and anticoagulation as indicated.  
- Give high‑intensity statin (continue existing statin).  
- Give sublingual nitroglycerin for pain if not hypotensive, and consider beta‑blocker if no contraindication.  
- Oxygen only if hypoxic (SpO2 < 90%).  
- Repeat ECGs and serial troponins, obtain bedside echocardiogram if needed, and prepare for urgent cardiology evaluation/angiography.

Gallbladder cancer,B,Pancreatitis,neutral,"Thanks — based on what you described, the most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis, most often from alcohol in someone with a long history of heavy drinking. The classic features you gave are: sudden severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, repeated vomiting, fever, tachycardia and borderline blood pressure.

What the ED was likely checking and what they might find
- Serum lipase (most specific) and amylase — pancreatitis is likely if lipase (or amylase) is >3× the upper limit of normal.  
- CBC — may show leukocytosis.  
- Basic metabolic panel — check BUN/creatinine, electrolytes (hypocalcemia can occur), glucose.  
- Hematocrit — hemoconcentration (high Hct) suggests more severe disease/need for aggressive fluids.  
- Liver tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin) and alkaline phosphatase — to look for gallstone cause.  
- CRP — rises with inflammation (peaks later, helps gauge severity).  
- Blood gas if worried about respiratory function or acid/base.  
- Blood cultures only if you suspect infection (fever doesn’t always mean infected pancreas).  
- Imaging: RUQ ultrasound to look for gallstones; contrast CT abdomen usually performed if diagnosis is uncertain or to assess severity/complications (often done 48–72 hours after onset unless clinically necessary earlier).

Why fever doesn’t necessarily mean infection
- High fever and SIRS can occur early from inflammation. Infected pancreatic necrosis is typically a later complication (usually >1 week). Antibiotics are not given routinely unless infection is proven or strongly suspected.

Initial treatment you should expect in the ED/hospital
- Aggressive IV fluids (crystalloids, often lactated Ringer’s) to maintain BP and perfusion.  
- IV pain control (opioids are commonly used).  
- Antiemetics and NPO (no oral intake) initially.  
- Monitor vitals, urine output, and labs closely; transfer to ICU if hypotension, respiratory failure, renal failure or other organ dysfunction.  
- Treat alcohol withdrawal risk: thiamine and appropriate meds (benzodiazepines) if needed.  
- If gallstone pancreatitis is suspected, surgical/gastroenterology consultation for possible ERCP or cholecystectomy may be needed.

How severity is assessed
- Several scores exist (BISAP, Ranson, APACHE II). Important clinical markers of severe disease: persistent hypotension, organ failure (respiratory, renal, cardiovascular), rising hematocrit or BUN, and imaging evidence of necrosis or complications.

When to get urgent help
- Worsening shortness of breath, dropping blood pressure, decreasing urine output, worsening mental status, or continuing severe uncontrolled pain are red flags and require immediate escalation.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,E,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,neutral,"Thanks — this picture is worrying for a “pulmonary–renal syndrome” (simultaneous lung bleeding/ inflammation and kidney involvement). The two most likely causes here are:

- ANCA-associated vasculitis (most likely granulomatosis with polyangiitis/GPA given the recurrent lung problems and spontaneous epistaxis)  
- Anti–glomerular basement membrane (anti‑GBM, Goodpasture) disease

Why I suspect this
- Hemoptysis + recurrent hematuria (and prior episodes of blood in the urine) = involvement of lung and kidney.  
- Epistaxis and prior recurrent lung infections fit with upper–airway and pulmonary involvement seen in GPA.  
- Chest x‑ray showing a resolving opacity could reflect an inflammatory nodule/cavitary lesion or prior pulmonary hemorrhage rather than simple infection.

What needs to be done urgently
1. Hospital admission and immediate specialist involvement: nephrology and rheumatology (and ENT/pulmonology if active bleeding).  
2. Important tests now:
   - Urinalysis with microscopy (look for dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts) and urine protein.  
   - Serum creatinine, BUN, electrolytes, CBC, coagulation studies.  
   - ANCA panel (c‑ANCA/PR3 and p‑ANCA/MPO) and anti‑GBM antibodies.  
   - Chest CT (better defines lung lesions) and consider bronchoscopy if active pulmonary hemorrhage.  
   - Blood and urine cultures if infection is a concern.  
   - If kidney involvement is confirmed or labs deteriorate, a renal biopsy (often diagnostic: crescentic glomerulonephritis).

3. Immediate management considerations
   - Supportive care (airway protection, oxygen, transfuse if needed, stop any anticoagulants).  
   - If a life‑threatening pulmonary hemorrhage or rapidly progressive renal failure is present, treatment is urgent and often started before all results return: high‑dose intravenous corticosteroids plus disease‑specific therapy — plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide (or rituximab) are commonly used depending on whether anti‑GBM or ANCA disease is responsible. Decisions will be made by nephrology/rheumatology.

What to watch for (seek emergency care)
- Increasing shortness of breath, ongoing or worsening hemoptysis, dizziness or fainting, decreased urine output, swelling, or sudden worsening of labs.

Bottom line: This pattern requires urgent inpatient evaluation for ANCA‑associated vasculitis or anti‑GBM disease.

Reactive arthritis,D,Acute gout,neutral,"You have an acute gout attack (acute monoarticular gouty arthritis) of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The synovial fluid findings—cloudy yellow fluid with a very high WBC count and negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals—are diagnostic for monosodium urate crystal arthritis (gout). (By contrast, calcium pyrophosphate crystals in pseudogout are rhomboid-shaped and positively birefringent.)

What this means now
- The painful, swollen, red, warm joint and low-grade fever are typical of an acute gout flare.  
- Because septic arthritis can sometimes coexist, synovial fluid should also be sent for Gram stain and culture (and empiric antibiotics started only if infection is suspected or confirmed).

Immediate treatment options (choose based on your other medical problems)
- First-line: NSAIDs if no contraindication (e.g., indomethacin 50 mg TID or naproxen 500 mg BID) until the attack settles (usually several days).  
- Alternative: Colchicine (low-dose regimen: 1.2 mg once, then 0.6 mg one hour later, then 0.6 mg once or twice daily as tolerated) — start early in the attack and adjust for renal function.  
- If NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated or ineffective: oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 30–50 mg daily for 3–5 days or a short taper) or an intra-articular steroid injection if the single joint is accessible.

Important cautions
- Do not start long-term urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol, febuxostat) during an acute flare; start only after the flare has resolved (and consider prophylaxis if you start therapy).  
- Check baseline labs: serum uric acid, renal function, liver tests, and send synovial fluid for Gram stain/culture to exclude infection.  
- Adjust medication choices if you have kidney disease, peptic ulcer disease, or other contraindications.

Lifestyle and follow-up
- Reduce alcohol (beer and spirits raise gout risk), limit red meat and shellfish, maintain hydration, and lose weight if overweight.  
- After recovery, see your primary doctor or a rheumatologist to discuss prevention if you have recurrent attacks, to evaluate for secondary causes, and to decide on urate-lowering therapy (indications include frequent flares, tophi, or urate nephrolithiasis).

The corkscrew/fragile hair and easy bruising strongly suggest vitamin C deficiency (scurvy). The triad of confusion, ataxia and nystagmus suggests concomitant thiamine deficiency/Wernicke encephalopathy (common in malnourished, demented patients living alone). Both can coexist.

Immediate actions (what I would do now)
- Treat empirically for thiamine deficiency (don’t wait for labs): give IV thiamine immediately (typical ED dosing 100–500 mg IV once, then repeat daily per local protocol; many centers use 200–500 mg IV daily for a few days for suspected Wernicke). Give before any dextrose.
- Start vitamin C replacement: e.g. 100–250 mg PO/IV daily (severe cases often treated with up to 300–500 mg/day until recovery, then 100 mg daily for 1 month).
- Continue IV fluids, monitor vitals and mental status, fall precautions, admit.

Diagnostic and supportive workup
- Trauma evaluation: noncontrast head CT (given fall and new confusion), chest x‑ray and rib series to assess rib fractures/pneumothorax, consider CT chest if concern for occult injury.
- Basic labs: CBC (look for anemia), CMP (electrolytes, renal/hepatic), coagulation, glucose, B12/folate, TSH, ESR/CRP, blood cultures/urinalysis if infection suspected.
- Specific tests: serum thiamine and vitamin C levels if available (do not delay treatment awaiting results).
- Cardiac evaluation as indicated (ECG, troponin) given systolic murmur and crackles.
- Consults: geriatrics/nutrition, neurology if persistent focal deficits, social work / case management for home safety and long‑term support.

Disposition
- Admit for observation, treatment of deficiencies, trauma management, and workup of delirium. Arrange nutrition support and social services to address inadequate dietary intake and prevent recurrence.

222,"I am a 73-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department due to a fever and a productive cough that had persisted for two days. Over the past two weeks, I experienced increasing fatigue and shortness of breath, during which I also lost about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). A year ago, I underwent chemotherapy for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and have since been receiving supportive treatment and regular blood transfusions. I do not smoke or consume alcohol.

Upon arrival at the hospital, my vital signs were recorded: I had a temperature of 38.5℃ (101.3℉), a pulse of 93 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a blood pressure reading of 110/65 mm Hg. The examination revealed petechiae on my lower extremities and purpura on my trunk and limbs. Additionally, several enlarged lymph nodes were noted in both my axillary and cervical regions. When my lungs were auscultated, crackles were detected in the left lower lobe.

A physical examination of my heart and abdomen showed no abnormalities. The medical team conducted laboratory studies, although I do not have the results to discuss. Based on the clinical findings, the healthcare providers evaluated my condition further.",A. Acute myeloid leukemia B. Burkitt lymphoma C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation D. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema E. Small cell lung cancer,A,Acute myeloid leukemia,neutral,"Thanks — this is a concerning picture. I’ll summarize the most likely problems, what the team is probably worried about, and the immediate tests and treatments that are typically done next. If you have your lab results (CBC with differential, platelet count, chest x‑ray, blood cultures) I can be more specific.

What your presentation suggests
- Active lower‑respiratory infection (fever, productive cough, crackles in left lower lobe) — pneumonia is very likely.
- Bleeding signs (petechiae, purpura) strongly suggest thrombocytopenia (common in MDS and after chemotherapy). This raises bleeding risk.
- General symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, new lymphadenopathy) raise concern for transformation of MDS to an acute leukemia (therapy‑related AML) or another hematologic/malignant process, or else systemic infection/immune reaction.
- Because of prior chemotherapy and ongoing transfusions you are immunocompromised and at higher risk for severe infection, atypical organisms, and hematologic relapse.

Immediate/urgent evaluations the team should do now
- CBC with differential and peripheral blood smear (look for neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, circulating blasts).
- Platelet count and hemoglobin (to guide transfusions).
- Blood cultures (before antibiotics, if possible) and sputum culture/Gram stain; consider viral testing (influenza, RSV, SARS‑CoV‑2) and Pneumocystis/other opportunists if indicated.
- Chest x‑ray (or chest CT if abnormal or concern for complications).
- Coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, D‑dimer) if bleeding or DIC suspected.
- Basic metabolic panel, liver tests, lactate (sepsis markers), urinalysis.
- If peripheral smear shows blasts or WBC is abnormal: urgent hematology consult and bone marrow aspiration/biopsy with cytogenetics/flow cytometry.
- If significant lymphadenopathy persists or is isolated, consider node biopsy.

Immediate management steps commonly taken
- Hospitalize and start empiric intravenous antibiotics promptly (given fever and possible neutropenia). For neutropenic fever or immunocompromised patients, an anti‑pseudomonal beta‑lactam (eg, cefepime, piperacillin‑tazobactam, meropenem) is standard until cultures return. Add agents based on local practice and allergy history.
- Supportive transfusions:
  - Platelet transfusion if platelets are critically low or if active bleeding (typical thresholds: <10 × 10^9/L for prophylaxis; <50 × 10^9/L if active bleeding or invasive procedure).
  - Red cell transfusion if symptomatic anemia or Hb below institutional threshold.
- If there is neutropenia with fever, follow neutropenic fever protocols (isolation, broad empiric coverage, antifungals if prolonged).
- If peripheral WBC is extremely high with respiratory or neurologic symptoms (leukostasis), urgent leukapheresis/ cytoreduction may be needed.
- Admit to a monitored bed, give oxygen if hypoxic, IV fluids and sepsis management if hemodynamically unstable.
- Early involvement of hematology/oncology (for possible MDS→AML transformation) and infectious disease as needed.

What this could mean long term
- If bone marrow shows progression to acute leukemia, treatment options depend on the exact diagnosis, cytogenetics, your functional status and goals of care; options range from supportive care to chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents, sometimes transplant in selected patients (less likely at age 73).
- If it’s primarily pneumonia with stable hematology, treatment and recovery are possible, but your marrow disease increases risks and may prolong recovery.

223,"I am a 45-year-old man who recently visited an urgent care clinic due to a concerning symptom. This morning, I coughed up blood for the first time, despite having a persistent cough for the past three weeks. I also noticed that my voice has been hoarse for the last few months, which I initially attributed to the cough.

I have a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day since I was 20, and I drink wine every night before bed. I have no significant past medical history or family history that I am aware of. 

During my visit, the healthcare provider noted my vital signs, which included a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, a temperature of 36.5°C (97.8°F), and a blood pressure of 140/88 mm Hg. They performed an indirect laryngoscopy, during which they found a rough vegetating lesion on the free border of my right vocal cord. 

I left the clinic with a lot of questions about what could be causing these symptoms and what the next steps would be for diagnosis and treatment.",A. Acute laryngitis B. Leukoplakia C. Polypoid corditis D. Vocal cord nodule E. Laryngeal carcinoma,E,Laryngeal carcinoma,neutral,"Thank you for the clear history — this is an important finding and reasonably concerning given your risk factors.

What your findings may mean
- A “rough vegetating lesion” on the free edge of a vocal cord in a long-time smoker with months of hoarseness is suspicious for a laryngeal malignancy (most commonly squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis).  
- Other possibilities (less likely but not excluded) include benign lesions such as papilloma (HPV-related), granuloma, vocal cord polyp/nodule, or chronic laryngitis/trauma with reactive changes.  
- Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) can come from an irritated/bleeding vocal cord lesion, but in a smoker it also raises concern for a lung source (bronchitis, bronchiectasis or lung cancer). Because of the hemoptysis, the evaluation should include both the larynx and the chest.

What should happen next (urgent steps)
1. Urgent ENT (head & neck) referral for direct examination and biopsy. The definitive diagnosis requires tissue (microlaryngoscopy with biopsy under anesthesia or office-based biopsy if feasible).  
2. Imaging: at minimum a chest x‑ray to assess the lungs; often a contrast CT scan of the neck and chest is done for staging if cancer is found.  
3. If bleeding becomes heavy, you have breathing difficulty, or significant ongoing hemoptysis, go to the emergency department immediately.  
4. Stop smoking now and avoid alcohol; both increase cancer risk and interfere with healing/treatment. Seek smoking-cessation support (counseling, nicotine replacement, medications).  
5. Voice rest and avoid throat irritation until ENT evaluates you.

What to expect at the ENT visit and afterward
- ENT will likely perform flexible laryngoscopy and then plan microlaryngoscopy with biopsy. They may do stroboscopy to assess vocal cord motion.  
- If biopsy shows cancer, treatment depends on stage: early glottic cancers are often curable with radiation therapy or transoral laser excision; more advanced disease may require surgery (partial or total laryngectomy) with or without radiation/chemotherapy. Prognosis for early glottic cancer is generally good.  
- If biopsy shows a benign lesion or inflammatory/reactive change, treatment will be tailored (surgical excision for papilloma/polyp; reflux treatment and voice therapy for granuloma/laryngitis).

Immediate practical advice
- Make an ENT appointment for biopsy within days to 1–2 weeks (sooner if your hemoptysis continues).  
- Get a chest x‑ray promptly.  
- Stop smoking and cut alcohol.  
- Seek emergency care for heavy bleeding, breathing trouble, or swallowing difficulty.

224,"I recently visited the physician for a well-child examination, as I had some concerns about my weight. At 17 years old, I often find myself at buffet restaurants, but I usually feel guilty about my eating choices afterward. I also have a history of burning my extremities with cigarettes, which I know is not a healthy behavior. 

My last menstrual period occurred three weeks ago. I am currently in high school and play field hockey on the school team, which keeps me active. During the examination, the doctor noted that I am in the 25th percentile for height, the 12th percentile for weight, and the 17th percentile for BMI. 

During the physical exam, the doctor observed bilateral enlargement of my parotid glands. They also examined my mouth and found signs of perimolysis. Fortunately, the rest of the examination did not reveal any other abnormalities. After discussing my symptoms and concerns, the physician considered my situation and indicated that there are potential diagnoses that could explain my symptoms.","A. Major depressive disorder B. Kleine-Levin syndrome C. Binge eating disorder D. Bulimia nervosa E. Obsessive compulsive disorder F. Borderline personality disorder G. Body dysmorphic disorder H. Anorexia nervosa
""",D,Bulimia nervosa,neutral,"The constellation of symptoms and signs is most consistent with bulimia nervosa.

Why: 
- You describe episodes of large-amount eating at buffets followed by guilt (suggesting binge eating).  
- The physician found bilateral parotid enlargement and perimolysis (dental enamel erosion) — classic physical findings from recurrent self‑induced vomiting.  
- Your BMI percentile is lowish but not severely low and you are still menstruating, which makes anorexia nervosa (restricting type) less likely; binge‑eating disorder would usually be associated with overweight/obesity and lacks compensatory purging.

Other possibilities to consider (less likely given the findings): anorexia nervosa, other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED) if full DSM criteria aren’t met, recurrent vomiting from a medical cause (mumps/parotitis, gastroesophageal reflux, medication/substance), or rumination disorder (rare at your age).

What to do next:
- Be asked directly about frequency, amount, and compensatory behaviors (vomiting, laxatives/diuretics, excessive exercise) and about self‑harm or suicidal thoughts.  
- Screening tools (e.g., SCOFF) and a comprehensive psychiatric assessment.  
- Medical workup: electrolytes (K+, Na+, Mg2+, phosphate), renal function, serum/urine pregnancy test if indicated, serum amylase, and an ECG (risk of arrhythmia with electrolyte disturbances).  
- Dental evaluation and treatment for enamel erosion; treat salivary/gland issues if infected or painful.  
- Treatment: referral to an eating‑disorder specialist and mental health professional for evidence‑based therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy for bulimia is first‑line). Pharmacotherapy (fluoxetine) can help in bulimia but should be prescribed and monitored by a clinician.  
- Address self‑injury and cigarette burns directly; if there is any current suicidal intent or unsafe behavior, urgent mental health care is required.

- give a short list of questions you should expect/ask your provider,  
- provide wording for how to tell your parents or school counselor, or  
- point you to resources for adolescent eating disorders and crisis help.",Kleine-Levin syndrome,True,True,True,True,True
225,"I am 57 years old and recently experienced two days of severe, generalized abdominal pain that worsened after meals. Along with the pain, I felt nauseated and noticed that I had occasional diarrhea, which was mixed with blood. My medical history is mostly unremarkable, aside from having essential hypertension. 

During this time, my vital signs were taken: my temperature was 36.9°C (98.4°F), my blood pressure was measured at 145/92 mm Hg, and my pulse was irregular, at 105 beats per minute. When examined physically, the doctor noted mild tenderness around my belly button. The combination of these symptoms raised concerns, and I was informed that further evaluation was necessary to determine the cause of my condition.",A. Acute pancreatitis B. Crohn's disease C. Acute mesenteric ischemia D. Diverticular disease E. Gastroenteritis,C,Acute mesenteric ischemia,neutral,"Most likely cause: acute mesenteric ischemia — classically an embolic or thrombotic occlusion of a mesenteric artery (usually the superior mesenteric artery). Your picture fits because:
- Severe, generalized abdominal pain that can be “out of proportion” to the mild exam findings (you note only mild periumbilical tenderness).
- Pain worse after eating (post‑prandial pain is a common feature of mesenteric ischemia/intestinal angina).
- Bloody diarrhea can occur when bowel becomes ischemic/necrotic.
- An irregular, rapid pulse suggests atrial fibrillation — a common source of arterial emboli to the mesenteric circulation.
- Age and hypertension increase vascular risk.

Other possibilities (less likely given the presentation) include ischemic colitis, severe infectious colitis, small‑bowel obstruction, or pancreatitis, but the combination of sudden severe pain, bloody stool and an irregular tachyarrhythmia strongly points to mesenteric ischemia.

What should be done now (urgent):
- Go to the emergency department immediately if you are not already there. Mesenteric ischemia is a vascular emergency; bowel infarction can develop quickly.
- Tests likely to be done urgently: EKG (to confirm atrial fibrillation), serum lactate, CBC, electrolytes, coagulation panel, blood cultures, and contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the abdomen/pelvis (CTA) to look for mesenteric vessel occlusion. Plain lactate and acid–base disturbances support ischemia if elevated.
- Initial management: NPO, IV fluids, broad supportive care, IV analgesia; if clinical suspicion is high, systemic anticoagulation with IV heparin is commonly started (unless contraindicated) while arranging definitive therapy.
- Definitive therapy: urgent vascular or surgical intervention — endovascular thrombectomy/angioplasty/stenting or open embolectomy/ bowel resection if infarction present. Surgical consult (vascular and general surgery) immediately.

- The combination of months of progressive abdominal pain, early satiety, weight loss and new-onset postmenopausal bleeding/spotting is highly concerning for an intra‑abdominal malignancy — most commonly an ovarian epithelial cancer in a woman of this age. Ovarian cancer classically causes vague abdominal pain, bloating/early satiety and weight loss. Any postmenopausal bleeding is also worrisome for a gynecologic cancer (endometrial or cervical) and must be evaluated.

Important immediate issue
- Hematemesis (vomiting blood) is an acute problem that needs prompt assessment and stabilization and may be unrelated to the pelvic process (eg, peptic ulcer or gastric malignancy). It should be managed right away.

Recommended next steps (priorities)
1. Stabilize and assess for active bleeding
   - Check CBC (hemoglobin/hematocrit), platelets, INR/PT, BMP; IV access and fluid resuscitation as needed; type and cross if transfusion may be required.
   - Arrange urgent upper endoscopy (EGD) to identify and treat the source of hematemesis.

2. Concurrent gynecologic evaluation for postmenopausal bleeding and pelvic symptoms
   - Pelvic exam with speculum to inspect cervix for lesions.
   - Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound to assess the uterus and adnexa (ovaries) for masses or endometrial thickening.
   - Endometrial sampling (endometrial biopsy) — indicated for any postmenopausal bleeding to rule out endometrial cancer.
   - Pap test/HPV testing if not up to date and as clinically indicated.

3. Cross‑sectional imaging and tumor markers
   - CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (or pelvic MRI when appropriate) to look for ovarian masses, ascites, and other intra‑abdominal pathology. If EGD suggests a gastric source, consider CT chest/abdomen/pelvis to stage or look for primary gastric cancer/metastases.
   - CA‑125 blood test (useful adjunct for ovarian cancer evaluation in postmenopausal women, not diagnostic alone).

4. Specialist referrals
   - Urgent referral to gynecology/gynecologic oncology for evaluation and planning (biopsy, possible surgical management).
   - Gastroenterology for management of the hematemesis and EGD findings.

Why this plan
- Postmenopausal bleeding must be investigated promptly (endometrial cancer until proven otherwise).
- Early satiety, persistent abdominal pain and weight loss in a postmenopausal woman raise strong concern for ovarian cancer or another intra‑abdominal malignancy; imaging and CA‑125 help guide next steps.
- Hematemesis needs immediate evaluation because it can be life‑threatening and may represent a separate or related malignancy (eg, gastric cancer with metastasis).

227,"I am a 28-year-old man who has been experiencing chronic back pain for the past year. This pain began after I started working at a logistics company, and I do not recall any specific injury that could have caused it. I have seen two other physicians about my back pain, but neither was able to provide a diagnosis. 

In addition to the back pain, I began to notice abdominal bloating and a feeling of constipation that started about three weeks ago. After researching my symptoms online, I became concerned that these issues might be related to pancreatic cancer, prompting me to request a CT scan of my abdomen for reassurance. 

I also have a history of episodic chest pain, which I discussed with another healthcare provider, but tests at that time did not indicate any problems. I do not smoke or drink alcohol, but I do feel significant pressure from my superiors at work due to frequent performance evaluations. For my overall health, I take daily multivitamins and glucosamine to help prevent arthritis. 

During my examination, my vital signs were normal, and my abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended. There was mild tenderness in my paraspinal muscles, but the rest of the examination, including a neurological assessment, showed no abnormalities. An x-ray of my spine also revealed no issues.",A. Adjustment disorder B. Malignant neoplasm C. Illness anxiety disorder D. Atypical depression E. Irritable bowel syndrome F. Conversion disorder G. Somatic symptom disorder H. Acute stress disorder,G,Somatic symptom disorder,neutral,"Short answer: pancreatic cancer is very unlikely in a healthy 28‑year‑old with a normal abdominal exam, no weight loss or jaundice, and only recent mild bloating/constipation. Your symptoms are far more likely to be mechanical/back‑muscle pain and common causes of bloating/constipation (diet, low fiber, stress, or functional bowel disorder).

Why pancreatic cancer is unlikely here
- Typical red flags for pancreatic cancer include older age (usually >50), unexplained weight loss, jaundice (yellow skin/eyes), fatty pale stools, new‑onset diabetes, or a persistent severe epigastric pain radiating to the back. You don’t have these.
- At 28, without risk factors (smoking, heavy alcohol use, family history) or concerning signs on exam, the chance is extremely low. A CT abdomen is usually not needed for reassurance alone.

More likely explanations
- Chronic mechanical low back pain / paraspinal muscle strain or myofascial pain (consistent with mild paraspinal tenderness and normal x‑ray/neurologic exam).
- Bloating/constipation from diet (low fiber), dehydration, reduced activity, stress, or functional bowel conditions (eg, IBS).
- Stress and workplace pressure can worsen both pain perception and bowel habits.

Practical next steps
1. Back pain (first-line)
   - Stay active, avoid prolonged sitting; begin a graded exercise program and core strengthening. Consider physical therapy or a guided exercise plan.
   - Use heat, simple analgesics (ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you can tolerate them), and topical analgesics as needed.
   - Ergonomic review at work (chair, lifting technique, frequent breaks).
   - If symptoms worsen, develop neurological signs (numbness/weakness, leg‑sciatica, saddle anesthesia), or don’t improve after ~6 weeks, see your doctor for further testing (MRI of the spine).

2. Bloating/constipation
   - Increase dietary fiber gradually (fruits, vegetables, whole grains), drink more water, and increase daily physical activity.
   - Try an osmotic laxative such as polyethylene glycol (eg, Miralax) once daily for a short trial if constipation is bothersome.
   - Avoid excessive caffeine/alcohol and identify foods that trigger bloating (dairy, beans, certain carbs).
   - If you develop severe abdominal pain, blood in stool, unintentional weight loss, or persistent change in bowel habits for >6–8 weeks, return for evaluation.

3. Tests to consider (with your PCP)
   - Basic labs: CBC and CMP (including liver tests and bilirubin), lipase if you have upper abdominal pain, fasting glucose (new diabetes can be a clue).
   - Imaging: not routinely needed now. CT abdomen with contrast is useful to evaluate the pancreas but is reserved for those with red flags or abnormal labs. MRI spine is appropriate if there are neurological signs.

When to seek urgent care
- New or worsening leg weakness, numbness, loss of bladder/bowel control (possible spinal cord compression).
- Severe progressive abdominal pain, jaundice, high fever, or rapid unintentional weight loss.
- New or concerning chest pain — seek immediate care.

Other notes
- Your supplements (multivitamins, glucosamine) are unlikely causes.
- Addressing workplace stress (counseling, occupational health, discussing workload) may help symptoms.

If you’d like, I can help you:
- Draft a brief note/request to your doctor for the specific labs/imaging or physical therapy referral; or
- Provide a simple home exercise/stretching plan for back pain; or

Over the past few weeks, I noticed that I felt unusually tired and thought I appeared more pale than usual. During my appointment, my physician conducted a thorough evaluation and ordered a complete blood count to better understand my symptoms.

The results indicated that my hemoglobin level was low, and I had a significantly reduced white blood cell and platelet count. Given these findings, my physician referred me for a bone marrow biopsy to investigate further. I underwent the biopsy procedure, which was necessary to determine the underlying cause of my symptoms and blood count abnormalities. I am currently awaiting the results to understand my diagnosis and the next steps in my care.",A. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia B. Acute myelogenous leukemia C. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia D. Chronic myelogenous leukemia E. Multiple myeloma,B,Acute myelogenous leukemia,neutral,"Thanks — that’s a helpful summary. Low hemoglobin plus low white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia) means the bone marrow isn’t making enough of all three cell lines or is being replaced/affected. A bone marrow biopsy is the right next step because it shows marrow cellularity and composition and lets your hematologist run tests that usually give a clear diagnosis.

What the biopsy is looking for and what the results can show
- The pathologist will examine the aspirate and core biopsy for overall cellularity (hyper‑, normo‑, or hypocellular), presence of abnormal immature cells (blasts), dysplastic changes, fibrosis, or infiltration by cancer (metastatic tumor or lymphoma).  
- They will usually send material for flow cytometry, cytogenetics (karyotype), FISH and molecular testing — these identify leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and specific mutations that guide therapy. Some results (morphology, flow) often come back in days; cytogenetics and molecular reports can take 1–2 weeks or longer.

Common diagnostic categories your doctor is considering
- The main possibilities include bone marrow failure from aplastic anemia or drug/toxin effects, marrow disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes or acute leukemia, marrow infiltration by cancer, and less commonly severe nutritional deficiencies or infections that suppress marrow. Which of these is true for you will determine treatment.

Immediate precautions while you wait
- Because low platelets raise bleeding risk and low neutrophils raise infection risk, avoid NSAIDs and aspirin, avoid contact sports or heavy exertion, and be gentle with dental care (soft toothbrush). Watch for any new fevers (even 100.4°F/38°C), sudden heavy bleeding, increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, or confusion — report those to your doctor or go to the ER immediately. If you develop a fever with severe neutropenia you may need urgent antibiotics or admission.

Common next steps/treatments depending on results
- If transfusions are needed for symptomatic anemia or bleeding risk from low platelets, your team can arrange red cell or platelet transfusions. If severe infection risk exists, growth factors (G‑CSF) or prophylactic antibiotics may be used. Specific definitive treatments vary widely: immunosuppressive therapy or stem cell transplant for aplastic anemia, chemotherapy for acute leukemia, hypomethylating agents or transplant for some myelodysplastic syndromes, or targeted therapy if a specific mutation is found.

Questions to ask your hematologist
- What did the biopsy show? Which additional tests were sent and when will results be back? Do I need transfusions or antibiotics now? Are there medications or exposures we should stop? What is the likely timeframe for a treatment plan? Are there fertility or vaccine considerations?

If you’d like, tell me the biopsy results (or paste them here) when you get them and I can help explain what they mean and what treatment options might be. In the meantime, if you have specific symptoms (fever, bleeding, fainting) tell your doctor right away.",Acute myelogenous leukemia,False,True,False,False,True

Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis C. HIV encephalopathy D. Primary CNS lymphoma E. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,E,Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,neutral,"Thanks — this clinical picture is concerning for an opportunistic central nervous system (CNS) process in a patient with HIV who has been off therapy. The combination of months of progressive cognitive decline and a more recent focal right‑leg weakness/falls, somnolence/confusion, behavioral change, and generalized lymphadenopathy narrows the most likely causes and the next urgent steps.

Most likely diagnoses (prioritized)
- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML, JC virus) — subacute progressive focal neurologic deficits and cognitive decline; MRI: non‑enhancing confluent white‑matter demyelinating lesions without much mass effect. Common in advanced immunosuppression.
- Cerebral toxoplasmosis — common in advanced AIDS (usually CD4 <100). Presents with focal deficits, headache, confusion; MRI: multiple ring‑enhancing lesions with surrounding edema (often basal ganglia/corticomedullary junction).
- Primary CNS lymphoma — can present similarly (focal deficits, cognitive change); MRI: solitary or few periventricular lesions, often homogeneously enhancing; frequently EBV+ in CSF. Systemic lymphadenopathy could point toward systemic lymphoma.
- HIV‑associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) — more diffuse, subcortical cognitive slowing and executive dysfunction over months; less likely to explain new focal leg weakness.
- Less likely but possible: cryptococcal meningitis (subacute headache, altered mentation), neurosyphilis, metastatic or metastatic‑infective lesions.

Immediate next steps (urgent)
1. Neuroimaging now: MRI brain with and without contrast (and diffusion sequences). Do NOT do lumbar puncture before imaging if there is concern for mass lesion/raised intracranial pressure.
2. Laboratory tests:
   - CD4 count and HIV viral load.
   - CBC, CMP, blood glucose, liver/renal function.
   - Serum Toxoplasma IgG.
   - Blood cultures and testing for syphilis (RPR/FTA‑ABS).
3. After MRI (if no mass effect), urgent lumbar puncture with CSF studies: cell count, glucose, protein, bacterial/fungal cultures, cryptococcal antigen, JC virus PCR, EBV PCR, cytology (for lymphoma), and other targeted PCRs as indicated.
4. If imaging shows ring‑enhancing lesions and toxo IgG positive, many centers start empiric anti‑toxoplasma therapy (pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + leucovorin, or high‑dose TMP‑SMX) while re‑imaging after ~10–14 days. If no improvement, consider brain biopsy.
5. If imaging suggests PML (non‑enhancing white‑matter lesions), look for JC virus PCR in CSF and urgently involve neurology/ID. Management is primarily to restore immune function (start/optimize antiretroviral therapy).
6. If imaging suggests primary CNS lymphoma, get EBV PCR in CSF and consider stereotactic brain biopsy for definitive diagnosis; treat with methotrexate‑based chemo/radiation coordinated by oncology/neurology.

Other immediate care
- Admission, fall precautions, treat agitation/safety issues.
- Avoid immediate empiric corticosteroids unless mass effect/raised ICP — steroids can confound biopsy/diagnosis of lymphoma and other processes.
- Rapid involvement of infectious disease and neurology; consider neurosurgery if lesion requires decompression or biopsy.

Bottom line
This is an urgent evaluation for opportunistic CNS disease in a likely immunosuppressed patient. Get MRI brain with contrast now, check CD4/viral load and toxoplasma serology, and plan CSF testing (after imaging). Empiric anti‑toxoplasma treatment is often started if imaging and serology fit; PML and primary CNS lymphoma are key alternatives that require different therapies (immune reconstitution vs biopsy/oncologic therapy). Discuss re‑starting/optimizing antiretroviral therapy with ID once diagnoses are clearer to avoid IRIS complications.

230,"I am a 28-year-old resident in general surgery, and for the past two months, I have been feeling increasingly burned out. My workload has been heavy, with extremely long hours under stressful conditions. As a result, I have noticed that I am often irritable, edgy, and unfocused. I also find myself being forgetful, which has raised my anxiety about my performance at work. This anxiety has been significant enough to interfere with my sleep, even during my time off.

To address these issues, I was referred for counseling and prescribed some mild sleep aids to help me manage my sleep difficulties. When I returned for a follow-up a few months later, I noted a significant improvement in my condition. This improvement coincided with better staffing at the hospital and a more manageable workload, which has helped alleviate some of the stress I was experiencing. Overall, I feel much better now and am more capable of handling my responsibilities.",A. Adjustment disorder B. Generalized anxiety disorder C. Anxiety disorder D. Panic disorder E. Normal human behavior,A,Adjustment disorder,neutral,"Thank you for sharing this — what you describe is very common in residency and it’s encouraging that you’re feeling better. A few brief points and practical suggestions to help you consolidate your recovery and reduce the chance of relapse:

What likely helped
- Both system-level change (better staffing, lighter workload) and the supports you engaged (counseling, short-term sleep aids) are important. Burnout is often driven by work environment, so structural fixes matter as much as individual coping.

Continue what’s working
- Keep up with counseling while things are stable — early relapse prevention is easier than rebuilding later.
- If a prescriber tapered your sleep meds, follow their plan; if you stopped on your own and still sleep poorly, discuss alternatives before restarting meds.

Practical steps to maintain gains
- Sleep: consistent sleep-wake schedule, 30–60 minute wind-down (no screens, low light), caffeine cut-off 6–8 hours before sleep, avoid long daytime naps, and consider CBT-I (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) if problems persist.
- Daily routines: brief regular exercise (even 20–30 min), balanced meals, and good hydration. These support mood and cognition.
- Micro-recovery at work: short breaks, 5-minute breathing or grounding exercises between cases, brief walks, and safe delegation when possible.
- Boundaries: protect at least one predictable day or half-day off per week; decline nonessential tasks when you’re at capacity. Use scheduled check-ins with your program director/mentor to flag workload trends early.
- Social/support: keep regular contact with trusted friends/family and peer support groups; consider a mentor in surgery who understands residency demands.
- Skills: practice simple stress-reduction techniques (diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, 5–10 minutes of mindfulness daily).

System-level advocacy
- Track hours, sleep, and errors/near-misses if any — objective data helps when you raise concerns with program leadership or GME wellness.
- Use available institutional resources (EAP, occupational health, GME wellness officers). Ask for temporary schedule adjustments if stress recurs.

Warning signs to seek help sooner
- Increasing functional impairment (frequent mistakes, near-misses), persistent insomnia despite interventions, growing social withdrawal, hopelessness, or any thoughts of harming yourself or others — seek urgent mental health care or contact emergency services.

If you’d like, I can:
- Draft a short script/email to discuss workload adjustments with your program director,
- Give a 5–10 minute relaxation script you can use between cases,
- Or outline a simple CBT-I plan.

231,"I am an 8-year-old boy who was brought to the emergency department by my parents due to sudden abdominal pain that started about an hour ago. Earlier that morning, I had an episode of dark urine. Just three days prior, I was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

My family and I emigrated from Liberia to the U.S. three years ago, and I don't have a personal history of serious illness. My immunizations are current. When my parents took me to the hospital, the doctors checked my vital signs, which were normal. During the examination, they found that my abdomen was tender all over, and they noticed that the whites of my eyes had a yellowish tint. They also felt my spleen, which was slightly enlarged.

I understand that they did some tests, but I am not aware of the specific results. I was feeling pretty uncomfortable, and my parents were worried about my condition. The doctors seemed to be trying to figure out the cause of my symptoms.",A. Production of hemoglobin S B. Defective UMP synthase C. Cold agglutinins D. Absent hemoglobin beta chain E. Lead poisoning F. Deficient glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G. Defective RBC membrane proteins H. Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase,F,Deficient glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,neutral,"Most likely what happened
- Your story — sudden dark urine earlier, yellow eyes (jaundice), enlarged spleen, and symptoms that started soon after taking trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole (a sulfa antibiotic) — fits with acute hemolysis from G6PD deficiency.  
- G6PD deficiency is an X‑linked enzyme problem that is common in people of African ancestry. Certain drugs (like sulfa medications), some infections, and fava beans can cause red blood cells to break down suddenly. That breakdown causes dark urine (from hemoglobin), jaundice, low blood counts, and sometimes belly or back pain.

What the doctors are likely checking now
- Blood tests: complete blood count (to see if your red cells are low), reticulocyte count (shows your bone marrow making new red cells), bilirubin (indirect bilirubin rises when red cells break down), LDH (usually high), and haptoglobin (usually low in hemolysis).  
- Peripheral blood smear: may show damaged red cells (bite or blister cells).  
- Urinalysis: can show blood without many red blood cells (because it’s hemoglobin in the urine).  
- Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test: to rule out autoimmune hemolysis.  
- Kidney tests and electrolytes: to make sure the kidneys are okay because hemoglobin can harm them.
- A specific G6PD enzyme test can confirm the diagnosis, but it can be falsely normal during the active hemolysis, so it may be done later (a few weeks to months after recovery).

Immediate treatment steps
- Stopping the sulfa antibiotic right away (that’s crucial).  
- Supportive care: IV fluids to protect the kidneys, monitoring urine and blood tests, and oxygen if needed.  
- Blood transfusion if the anemia is severe or you are unstable.  
- Treat any infection if present (infections themselves can trigger hemolysis).  
- Avoid other oxidant drugs and triggers while recovering.

What to tell your parents and family
- This is probably a genetic condition; because it’s X‑linked, male children are affected and mothers can be carriers. Family testing can be offered.  
- Make a list of medications and foods to avoid in the future (examples: sulfonamides, some antimalarials like primaquine, dapsone, nitrofurantoin, and fava beans). Your doctors or a pharmacist can give a complete list.

When to be worried
- If you feel very weak, short of breath, dizzy, have very dark urine that doesn’t improve, little or no urine, or new severe belly pain — go to the ER right away.

232,"I arrived at the emergency room at the age of 42, experiencing noticeable facial droop. I first became aware of this issue that morning while preparing for work; my smile appeared asymmetric, and I found it difficult to fully close my left eye. Additionally, I had been dealing with foul-smelling drainage from my left ear for about a month. 

My medical history includes recurrent ear infections during childhood. Upon examination, my temperature was recorded at 99.0°F, and my vital signs showed a blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, a pulse of 72 beats per minute, and respirations at 14 per minute. I maintained an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.

During the physical exam, the doctor noted that my mouth was drooping downward on the left side, and I was unable to fully close my left eye. There was also drainage from my left ear, which was further examined with an otoscope. An audiometric evaluation revealed that I had conductive hearing loss in the left ear.

Why:
- Entire left face is weak (mouth droop and inability to close the left eye), which indicates a lower motor neuron facial palsy (UMN lesions from stroke usually spare the forehead).
- Foul-smelling otorrhea and a month of drainage plus conductive hearing loss strongly suggest chronic suppurative otitis media with possible cholesteatoma, which can erode the ossicles and petrous bone and involve the facial nerve in the middle ear/mastoid.
Next steps (typical):
- Urgent ENT evaluation, high-resolution CT temporal bones (or MRI) to look for cholesteatoma and facial canal erosion.

233,"I am a 32-year-old man and recently experienced severe breathlessness that lasted for several hours, prompting me to go to the emergency room. For the past few years, I have been treated for asthma by multiple physicians, but my symptoms have continued to worsen. I have never smoked, nor have I been exposed to cigarette smoke.

Family history is significant; my father passed away at the age of 40 due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and my uncle, who was my father’s brother, also died from a similar condition. 

Upon arrival at the emergency room, my respiratory rate was measured at 19 breaths per minute, and my temperature was 37.0°C (98.6°F). During the physical examination, it was noted that my exhalation was significantly longer than my inhalation, with an expiratory time exceeding six seconds. The examination also revealed the presence of clubbing and bilateral crackles during chest auscultation. Additionally, I was found to have mild hepatomegaly. 

These symptoms and findings have raised concerns about my respiratory health and the progression of my condition.",A. Pulmonary edema B. Lung cancer C. α1-antitrypsin-deficiency D. Asthma E. Pneumonia,C,α1-antitrypsin-deficiency,neutral,"You have features that make a genetic cause of early COPD very likely — most importantly: progressive obstructive symptoms despite no smoking, strong family history of “COPD” deaths in the 30s–40s, hepatomegaly, and lung exam findings. The single disorder that best ties all of this together is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), which causes early panacinar emphysema (often in the 30s–40s), can cause liver disease (hepatomegaly, cirrhosis), and is inherited.

What I suspect (not a definitive diagnosis)
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is the leading concern. Other possibilities to consider include hereditary/interstitial lung disease or bronchiectasis from another genetic cause, but AATD fits your combination of lung + liver + family history best.

Immediate and next-step tests to request
1. Serum alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) level (and CRP at same time — AAT is an acute-phase reactant).
2. If level is low: AAT phenotype/genotype (PI typing or SERPINA1 gene testing) to identify PI*Z, PI*S, etc.
3. Pulmonary function tests (spirometry with post-bronchodilator values and DLCO).
4. High-resolution chest CT (to look for lower-lobe panacinar emphysema and/or bronchiectasis/fibrosis).
5. Liver tests (AST, ALT, Alk Phos, bilirubin), coagulation (INR), and abdominal ultrasound (or elastography) to assess liver disease.
6. Oxygenation assessment (pulse oximetry/ABG if indicated).

Immediate management (while workup proceeds)
- Treat acute breathlessness per ER guidance: bronchodilators, supplemental O2 if hypoxic, antibiotics/steroids if infection/flare suspected — follow the treating clinician’s plan.
- Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure; get updated pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccines.
- Referral to pulmonology and hepatology once stabilized.

Long-term considerations if AATD confirmed
- Augmentation therapy (intravenous pooled human AAT) may be indicated for qualifying patients with emphysema and severe deficiency (usually PI*ZZ with airflow obstruction) — discuss with a specialist.
- Pulmonary rehabilitation, inhaled bronchodilators, vaccinations, and exacerbation prevention.
- Ongoing liver monitoring; hepatology follow-up and consideration of liver transplant for advanced cirrhosis.
- Genetic counseling and testing of family members.

What you can do now
- Ask the ED/pulmonology team to order serum AAT level and PI/genotype testing, PFTs, and a high-resolution chest CT.
- Bring up the family history and the hepatomegaly finding so they consider AATD promptly.
- If you want, I can draft a short message you can present to your doctor requesting these tests.

234,"I am a 61-year-old woman with diabetes, and I was brought to the emergency department after experiencing multiple bouts of abdominal pain over the past 24 hours. The pain was dull and aching, radiating to my back, and it worsened after meals. I also felt nauseous and occasionally vomited. This was not the first time I had these symptoms; I had been hospitalized several times in the past for similar issues.

During my assessment in the emergency department, my temperature was recorded at 37° C (98.6° F), my respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, my pulse was 77 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was 120/89 mm Hg. The examination revealed dark hyperpigmentation of the skin in my axillary area. 

I was aware that my condition had been monitored previously, and I had a blood test report from last month that indicated my glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 9.1%, and my triglyceride levels were notably high at 675 mg/dL. My cholesterol levels were also elevated, and my kidney function tests showed slightly increased serum creatinine. Given my symptoms and medical history, I understood that these factors would be important for my diagnosis.",A. Cholecystitis B. Choledocholithiasis C. Pancreatitis D. Duodenal peptic ulcer E. Gallbladder cancer,C,Pancreatitis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Recurrent acute pancreatitis — in your case very likely triggered by severe hypertriglyceridemia in the setting of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The dark axillary pigmentation is most consistent with acanthosis nigricans (insulin resistance), which often accompanies severe dyslipidemia and uncontrolled diabetes.

What to check right away (ED/hospital)
- Serum lipase (or amylase) to confirm pancreatitis.
- Basic labs: CBC, CMP (including creatinine, calcium, liver tests), blood glucose, HbA1c if not recent, fasting triglycerides/complete lipid panel now, coagulation panel, arterial/venous blood gas if clinically indicated.
- Serum ALT: a markedly elevated ALT suggests gallstone pancreatitis.
- Abdominal ultrasound (right upper quadrant) to look for gallstones/biliary obstruction.
- Contrast CT abdomen only if diagnosis is uncertain or to evaluate severity/complications after 24–48 hours.

Immediate treatment (initial ED/hospital care)
- NPO (nothing by mouth) until nausea/pain improve.
- Aggressive IV fluids (crystalloid, e.g., lactated Ringer’s if no contraindication).
- Adequate analgesia (usually IV opioids as needed) and antiemetics.
- Monitor vitals, urine output, and labs for organ dysfunction; consider ICU if severe.
- Glycemic control: treat hyperglycemia. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis and hyperglycemia, an IV insulin infusion often both controls glucose and accelerates triglyceride clearance (activation of lipoprotein lipase).
- For very high triglycerides (classically >1000 mg/dL) or clinical deterioration despite medical therapy, urgent plasmapheresis may be considered to rapidly reduce triglyceride levels. (At triglyceride levels like 675 mg/dL, insulin therapy and medical management are often appropriate; plasmapheresis is reserved for more extreme levels or refractory/critically ill patients.)
- Avoid routine heparin for TG lowering — it can transiently reduce TGs but may deplete lipoprotein lipase stores and is not generally recommended as long-term therapy.

Longer-term and secondary prevention
- Once acute episode is controlled and you can tolerate oral intake, begin or intensify triglyceride-lowering therapy: fibrate (e.g., fenofibrate) is first-line for very high TGs; high‑dose omega‑3 fatty acids can be added; statin therapy for ASCVD risk/dyslipidemia as indicated.
- Tight glycemic control: improve diabetes management (adjust medications, consider endocrinology referral). Poor diabetes control is a contributor to hypertriglyceridemia.
- Lifestyle: low-fat diet, reduce simple carbohydrates and refined sugars, weight loss, strict avoidance of alcohol, and increased physical activity as tolerated.
- Evaluate and treat other causes of recurrent pancreatitis: gallstones (consider cholecystectomy if gallstone pancreatitis), certain medications, hypercalcemia, autoimmune pancreatitis (IgG4), and less commonly genetic causes.
- Arrange follow-up with gastroenterology and endocrinology/lipid clinic.

Warnings/complications to watch for
- Worsening abdominal pain, fever, low blood pressure, reduced urine output, breathing difficulties, or signs of infected necrosis — these require urgent reassessment.
- Monitor kidney function (your creatinine is slightly elevated) before using contrast and for dosing of some drugs.

235,"I am a 5-year-old boy who recently visited the emergency room due to rapid swelling in my right knee after I fell while playing. My mother mentioned that I have always bruised easily, which has been a consistent part of my life. There is also a family history of bleeding issues; my uncle passed away from blood loss following a benign surgical procedure.

During the physical examination, the doctor noted multiple bruises on my arms, legs, and abdomen, each showing different stages of healing. My right knee was swollen, red, and tender to the touch. The doctor performed a procedure called arthrocentesis, which involved drawing fluid from my knee, and the fluid was bloody. They observed about 1,000 white blood cells in the aspirate. 

The medical team conducted further tests. I learned that my bleeding time was 4 minutes, which is within the normal range, but my activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 67 seconds, significantly longer than the normal range of 30 to 40 seconds.

The facts supporting this:

- Long aPTT (67 s) with a normal bleeding time points to a clotting‑factor problem (not a platelet problem).  
- Bloody joint aspirate and repeated bruising/hemarthroses are classic for hemophilia.  
- Family history of a maternal male relative who bled severely after a procedure fits X‑linked inheritance.  
- The most common form is Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency); Hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) produces the same pattern — specific factor assays are needed to tell which.

Recommended next steps
- Urgent hematology referral.  
- Laboratory: mixing study and quantitative factor VIII and IX levels (and PT, CBC).  
- Acute treatment of a bleeding joint: replacement of the deficient factor (factor concentrate) — in mild Hemophilia A DDAVP can help; in moderate/severe or for Hemophilia B specific factor concentrate is used. Treating quickly prevents joint damage.

Additionally, when asked to slowly lower my right arm from a position of 90 degrees of abduction, I found it difficult to hold my arm up, and it dropped to my side. 

The physician assessed my passive range of motion, which appeared normal.

""",B,Rotator cuff tear,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- A full‑thickness rotator‑cuff tear (most commonly the supraspinatus) causing ""pseudoparalysis.""  
  Why: pain in the 60–120° painful arc, inability to slowly lower the arm (positive drop test/weakness of active abduction), preserved passive range of motion, and lack of pain relief after a subacromial local anesthetic (suggesting a structural loss of tendon continuity rather than only impingement/tendonitis).

What to do next
1. Imaging: get an MRI of the shoulder (or a high‑quality shoulder ultrasound if MRI is not available) to confirm a full‑thickness tear and assess its size/retraction. Plain shoulder X‑rays can help evaluate the acromion shape and arthritis.
2. Specialist referral: see an orthopedic shoulder surgeon (or sports medicine) to review imaging and discuss options.

Treatment options (to discuss with the surgeon)
- Surgical repair (arthroscopic rotator‑cuff repair) is often recommended for symptomatic full‑thickness tears with marked loss of function and daily activity limitation, particularly if you want to regain strength for activities (e.g., tennis). Timing and candidacy depend on tear size, tendon quality, medical fitness and expectations.
- Nonoperative care (reasonable for some older patients or small tears): supervised physical therapy to strengthen the deltoid and remaining cuff, activity modification, NSAIDs/acetaminophen, and possible corticosteroid injection for pain control (note: steroid injections can help short‑term pain but don’t repair a tear and may affect tendon healing).
- If pain is severe now: short-term analgesia (NSAID if safe for you) and ice; avoid heavy or repetitive overhead use.

237,"I am a 67-year-old man who recently visited the emergency department due to a sudden change in my vision.

My pupils were equal and reactive, and the corneal reflex was present. The anterior chamber showed no abnormalities. However, the confrontation test revealed nasal and inferior defects in my left eye. After this assessment, I was awaiting dilation for a fundus examination to determine the next steps.",A. Degenerative retinoschisis B. Retinal detachment C. Acute angle-closure glaucoma D. Endophthalmitis E. Wet age-related macular degeneration F. Hemorrhagic choroidal detachment,B,Retinal detachment,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Your symptoms (sudden new floaters/“black spots,” flashes of light, then a painless “curtain” or peripheral field loss) after recent cataract surgery strongly point to a retinal detachment — most commonly a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Cataract surgery and diabetes increase your risk. Vitreous hemorrhage or a posterior vitreous detachment can have similar early symptoms, but the “curtain” phenomenon is classic for detachment.

Why this is urgent
- A retinal detachment can rapidly threaten permanent vision if not treated promptly. The chance of useful visual recovery depends on whether the macula (the central retina) is still attached and how quickly repair is done.

Immediate next steps you should take now
1. Urgent ophthalmology/retina specialist evaluation with a dilated fundus exam (and often scleral depression) — this should be done today, ideally within hours. If you have not yet seen an eye specialist, return to the ED or go directly to an eye clinic now.  
2. If detachment is confirmed, treatment options include pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckle, or pars plana vitrectomy; the retina specialist will choose the appropriate procedure.  
3. Avoid strenuous activity, heavy lifting, bending over, and rubbing the eye. Do not drive alone — arrange transportation.  
4. Monitor for any worsening (complete loss of vision in that eye, rapidly increasing floaters or flashes); if that happens, seek immediate care.

What to expect about outcome
- If the macula is still attached (macula-on), prompt repair can often preserve good vision. If the macula has detached (macula-off), surgery may still restore some vision but the final outcome is usually poorer. Earlier treatment gives the best chance.

An endotracheal tube was inserted to assist my ventilation, but my condition did not improve. The doctors reviewed my dental records, noting that a local anesthetic called pilocarpine was administered during the procedure. They began investigating the most likely cause of my condition.",A. Cyanide poisoning B. Methemoglobinemia C. Anaphylactic reaction D. Sulfhemoglobinemia E. Carbon monoxide poisoning,B,Methemoglobinemia,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: methemoglobinemia from the local anesthetic (prilocaine — the dental record probably meant prilocaine, not pilocarpine).

Why this fits
- Methemoglobin forms when hemoglobin’s iron is oxidized from ferrous (Fe2+) → ferric (Fe3%), which cannot bind O2.  
- Classic presentation: sudden cyanosis and hypoxia that does not correct with supplemental O2 or even intubation, clear lungs, and relatively normal PaO2 on arterial blood gas.  
- Pulse oximetry is unreliable and commonly reads ~85% regardless of true oxygen content.  
- Common culprits in dentistry: topical or injected anesthetics such as benzocaine and prilocaine (prilocaine’s metabolite—o‑toluidine—induces methemoglobinemia), especially in children/young adults.

Key diagnostic steps
- Draw an arterial blood gas with co-oximetry to measure methemoglobin fraction (definitive).  
- Inspect blood: classically “chocolate‑brown.”  
- Check methemoglobin level: cyanosis appears >10–15%, symptomatic effects often at higher levels (≥30–50%).

Treatment (emergency)
- If symptomatic or methemoglobin level is high, give IV methylene blue 1–2 mg/kg (1% solution = 10 mg/mL) over 5 minutes; repeat after 30–60 minutes if needed.  
- Be cautious/avoid methylene blue in known G6PD deficiency (can cause hemolysis); alternatives include high‑dose ascorbic acid, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen if severe.  
- Supportive care and monitoring; confirm and remove the offending agent.

Recommended next steps (urgent):
- Immediate referral to a hematologist.
- Formal severity assessment (ANC, platelet count, absolute reticulocyte count and marrow cellularity; severe aplastic anemia criteria guide urgency of therapy).
- Further workup to look for reversible causes: viral serologies (hepatitis A/B/C, HIV, parvovirus, EBV/CMV as indicated), review of medications/toxin exposures, and tests to exclude related disorders (PNH flow cytometry, cytogenetics/NGS to exclude hypoplastic MDS).
- If severe, HLA typing (for possible allogeneic stem cell transplant) and prompt discussion of treatment options.

240,"I am a 48-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department after being found in a stuporous state outside my apartment on a cold night. I had a small cut on my forehead. After a non-contrast head CT was performed, the results were normal, and I was monitored in the ED.

Twelve hours later, I experienced a distressing episode where I yelled for help, believing that the wallpaper was threatening my family. At that time, I also had a headache. I have been drinking alcohol regularly for about ten years, and prior to my admission, I consumed a pint of vodka. I occasionally smoke marijuana and use cocaine.

While my vital signs were within normal limits, I appeared markedly distressed and was sweating significantly. During the mental status examination, I was alert and oriented, but I had a fine tremor in my right hand. The rest of the neurological exam showed no abnormalities. A urine toxicology screening was pending at that time.",A. Alcoholic hallucinosis B. Phencyclidine intoxication C. Cocaine intoxication D. Wernicke's encephalopathy E. Delirium tremens F. Brief psychotic disorder,A,Alcoholic hallucinosis,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Acute alcohol-withdrawal syndrome (alcohol-withdrawal hallucinosis). The timing (~12 hours after a heavy drink), preserved orientation with vivid visual hallucinations, tremor and autonomic hyperactivity (sweating, headache) fit alcohol withdrawal. Delirium tremens is a related, more severe form that usually occurs later and with marked disorientation and autonomic instability.

Immediate management (what should be done now)
1. Benzodiazepines — first‑line
   - Use symptom‑triggered benzodiazepine therapy (CIWA‑Ar guided) or scheduled dosing if severe.
   - Typical ED/acute regimens:
     - Diazepam 5–10 mg IV q5–10 min until sedation/withdrawal symptoms controlled (commonly used in ED/ICU), or
     - Lorazepam 1–2 mg IV q2–4 h PRN (preferred if significant liver disease), or
     - Oral chlordiazepoxide 50–100 mg initial then 25–50 mg q6h (if able to take PO and being admitted).
   - Titrate to control tremor, anxiety, diaphoresis and hallucinations. Escalate to ICU care and higher doses or phenobarbital if benzodiazepine‑refractory.

2. Thiamine and glucose
   - Give thiamine 100 mg IV (or IM) before any glucose-containing fluids (or immediately), then continue daily while at risk for Wernicke.
   - Dextrose and fluids as needed.

3. Supportive care and monitoring
   - Continuous observation for progression to delirium tremens or seizures; monitor vitals, oxygenation, electrolytes.
   - CIWA‑Ar scoring q1–4 h to guide benzodiazepine dosing.
   - Replace electrolytes (Mg, K, phosphate) as indicated.

4. Labs / imaging / precautions
   - CBC, CMP, Mg, Phosphate, LFTs, blood alcohol level, coagulation studies, urine toxicology (pending).
   - If any new focal neurologic signs, worsening consciousness, or suspicion of delayed intracranial bleed after the fall, repeat head CT.

5. Use of antipsychotics
   - Avoid antipsychotics as monotherapy because they do not prevent seizures and may lower seizure threshold.
   - Low‑dose haloperidol can be used as an adjunct for severe psychotic symptoms or dangerous agitation while benzodiazepines are given, but only with caution and continuous monitoring.

When to escalate
- Transfer to monitored/ICU setting if he develops marked autonomic instability, severe agitation not controlled with benzodiazepines, respiratory compromise from sedatives, or other complications (seizures, hyperthermia, severe electrolyte abnormalities).

Differential considerations to keep in mind
- Cocaine or stimulant intoxication/withdrawal (urine tox pending) — benzodiazepines are also helpful for stimulant agitation.
- Delayed intracranial bleed from his fall (repeat imaging if neurological status worsens).
- Wernicke encephalopathy (look for ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, confusion).

241,"I am a 20-year-old college student, and I found myself in the emergency room at 4 AM. For the past two hours, I had been experiencing abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The symptoms started about an hour after I heated and ate some food I had left over from earlier in the day. I had been studying for exams the night before, and I became hungry, which led me to eat that food. 

Upon arrival at the hospital, I was informed that my temperature was normal, but my pulse was elevated at 106 beats per minute, and my blood pressure was low at 90 over 78. The medical team conducted a physical examination and noted signs of dehydration, but other aspects of the exam were within normal limits. 

Throughout the experience, I remained focused on the symptoms I was facing, and I was eager to understand what was causing them. It was a concerning situation, given the sudden onset of my symptoms after eating.",A. Cryptosporidiosis B. C. difficile colitis C. Bacillus cereus infection D. Norovirus infection E. Rotavirus infection,C,Bacillus cereus infection,neutral,"What likely happened
- Your symptoms and timing strongly suggest an acute foodborne intoxication from a preformed bacterial toxin (most commonly Staphylococcus aureus or the emetic form of Bacillus cereus). These toxins produce illness very quickly — usually 1–6 hours after eating — and cause prominent nausea and vomiting with cramping and sometimes diarrhea.  
- The normal temperature but fast pulse (106) and low blood pressure (90/78) fit dehydration/hypovolemia from the vomiting and diarrhea rather than a systemic invasive infection.

Typical course and treatment
- Most toxin-mediated food poisonings are self-limited and improve within 24–48 hours with supportive care.  
- Immediate treatment is fluids and electrolyte replacement: small frequent sips of oral rehydration solution if you can tolerate them, or IV fluids if you are unable to keep liquids down or if you’re significantly hypotensive (which is why you were treated in the ER).  
- Antiemetics (ondansetron) can help stop vomiting so you can rehydrate. Antidiarrheals (loperamide) can be used cautiously if there is no high fever or bloody stool. Antibiotics are generally not needed for toxin-mediated illness.

When to seek further care
Return or seek immediate care if you have any of:
- Persistent vomiting so you cannot keep fluids down  
- Little or no urine output, dizziness, fainting, or worsening lightheadedness  
- High fever (>101.5°F / 38.6°C) or fever that develops later  
- Severe abdominal pain or bloody stool  
- Symptoms lasting more than 48–72 hours, or if you are immunocompromised or pregnant

Prevention tips
- Refrigerate leftovers promptly (within 2 hours), cool quickly, store below 40°F (4°C).  
- Reheat thoroughly to steaming hot (internal temp 165°F) — but note that reheating does not destroy toxins already produced in the food.  
- Avoid leaving rice and other starchy foods at room temperature for long periods (B. cereus risk).  
- Maintain good hand hygiene and safe food handling.

242,"I am a 72-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease. Recently, I have been experiencing recurrent chest pain, which occurs during physical activity. Initially, I would feel this pain when mowing my lawn, but it has progressed to happening even when I walk short distances, such as to get my mail. I notice that the pain resolves on its own when I sit down and rest.

During my visit to my primary care physician, my vital signs were recorded. My temperature was 98.2°F, blood pressure measured at 157/98 mm Hg, my pulse was 80 beats per minute, and my respirations were 15 per minute. I had an oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing room air. The physical examination indicated that I am an obese man, yet I was not in any distress at that time.

An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, and it showed no changes from a previous ECG I had taken. Furthermore, my first troponin level was recorded at 0.06 ng/mL, which was also unchanged from earlier tests. Given my symptoms and medical history, I am seeking to understand the most likely diagnosis for my condition.",A. NSTEMI B. Stable angina C. STEMI D. Unstable angina E. Variant angina,D,Unstable angina,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis: unstable angina (crescendo angina) — a non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome without biomarker rise.

Why: your chest pain is exertional angina that has recently progressed to occur with much less activity (decreased ischemic threshold), which is characteristic of unstable/crescendo angina. The ECG is unchanged and the troponin is not rising (you said it is unchanged from prior), which points to ischemia without myocardial necrosis rather than an NSTEMI. Note: chronic kidney disease can cause chronically higher baseline troponin levels, so serial measurements are important to detect an acute rise.

Recommended next steps (urgent):
- Immediate cardiology evaluation and likely hospital admission for ACS protocol.
- Serial ECGs and repeat troponins to look for dynamic changes.
- Medical therapy as directed by cardiology (aspirin, anti-ischemic therapy such as beta‑blocker and nitrates, high‑intensity statin; antiplatelet/anticoagulation per protocol).
- Risk‑stratification and consideration of coronary angiography — discuss contrast nephropathy risk given your CKD and take precautions if angiography is needed.
- Go to the emergency department right away or call emergency services if chest pain becomes more severe, occurs at rest, is prolonged, or is associated with shortness of breath, sweating, fainting, or nausea.

243,"I am a 32-year-old man who visited the emergency department due to worsening shortness of breath and a productive cough that had persisted for three days. Three weeks ago, I experienced trauma to my right hemithorax during a fight. Following that incident, I had significant pain and mild shortness of breath but did not seek medical attention at the time.

I do not smoke or consume alcohol, and I work as a construction worker. Upon my arrival at the emergency department, my temperature was recorded at 38.4°C (101.1°F), my pulse was 95 beats per minute, and my respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. My blood pressure was measured at 120/75 mm Hg, and my oxygen saturation on room air was 96%.

During the pulmonary examination, the physician noted decreased breath sounds over my right lower lung fields. To further assess my condition, a CT scan of my chest was performed, revealing fractures of my right 7th and 8th ribs, along with right pleural splitting and thickening, as well as a dense fluid collection in the pleural space.",A. Viral pleurisy B. Lung abscess C. Hemothorax D. Chylothorax E. Pleural empyema F. Mesothelioma,E,Pleural empyema,neutral,"Likely diagnosis
- The CT description (split-pleura sign, pleural thickening) plus fever and dense pleural fluid strongly suggests an empyema — an infected/complicated pleural effusion. Given your prior rib fractures, this could be an infected retained hemothorax or a parapneumonic empyema (rib fractures can predispose to pneumonia by causing splinting and poor clearance).

What needs to happen now (typical next steps)
1. Hospital admission and urgent evaluation by pulmonology and/or thoracic surgery.
2. Diagnostic thoracentesis immediately (if not already done) to obtain fluid for Gram stain, culture, cell count, pH, glucose, LDH — these results guide treatment. Findings that indicate the need for drainage include purulent fluid, positive Gram stain/culture, or pleural fluid pH < 7.20 or very low glucose.
3. Start empiric IV antibiotics promptly (cover typical organisms: streptococci, Staphylococcus including MRSA, and anaerobes). Common empiric regimens: vancomycin plus piperacillin–tazobactam (or a third‑generation cephalosporin + metronidazole) until cultures return — antibiotic choice should be individualized by local resistance patterns and allergies.
4. Drainage: if empyema is present (purulent fluid, positive cultures, or biochemical criteria), chest tube drainage (tube thoracostomy) is indicated. If loculated or thick septations are present, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (tPA + DNase) or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with possible decortication may be required.
5. Supportive care: analgesia (important for rib fractures), oxygen as needed, incentive spirometry/physiotherapy, IV fluids if sepsis, and repeat imaging to ensure resolution.

Prognosis and complications
- With prompt drainage and appropriate antibiotics most patients recover well. Delayed or inadequate treatment can lead to persistent loculations, fibrothorax, prolonged disability, or sepsis, sometimes requiring surgical decortication.

What you should do now
- Go to the hospital/emergency department if not already admitted and insist on pleural fluid drainage and IV antibiotics. Ask to speak with pulmonology/thoracic surgery and ensure cultures are obtained so therapy can be narrowed once results are available.

244,"I am a 48-year-old man who recently visited the emergency department with my wife due to experiencing progressive fatigue, shortness of breath with minimal exertion, and a persistent cough that has worsened at night over the past two months. I have a history of heavy alcohol consumption and occasionally smoke cigarettes. 

During my visit, I learned that my mother has heart disease, which required surgery two years ago for a device implantation in her heart. In the emergency department, my vital signs were recorded, showing a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a temperature of 36.3°C, and a regular pulse of 65 beats per minute. 

The physical examination revealed that I looked tired, with noticeable icteric sclera. The healthcare provider noted distended neck veins, a mildly distended abdomen, and a palpable, firm liver, along with a slightly enlarged spleen. I also had swelling in both ankles, and they detected S3 heart sounds and crackles at the bases of my lungs. 

A chest X-ray indicated an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Based on the findings, further tests such as liver function tests and an ECG were performed. The staff discussed the likelihood of needing an echocardiogram to assess my heart function.",A. Left ventricular hypertrophy with delayed relaxation and normal stroke volume B. Left ventricular dilatation in a spherical pattern with poor systolic function C. Speckled appearance of myocardium D. Apical ballooning of the left ventricle,B,Left ventricular dilatation in a spherical pattern with poor systolic function,neutral,"Summary of what your exam and tests most likely mean
- Your symptoms (progressive fatigue, breathlessness with minimal exertion, worsening nighttime cough), the exam findings (distended neck veins, S3 gallop, lung crackles, ankle edema, hepatomegaly/abdominal distension, icteric sclera) and the chest X‑ray showing an enlarged cardiac silhouette are most consistent with congestive heart failure (both left- and right‑sided features).  
- Given your history of heavy alcohol use, an alcohol‑related dilated cardiomyopathy is an important possible cause. Other causes to consider include ischemic heart disease, long‑standing hypertension, and less commonly viral or infiltrative cardiomyopathies.

Why the team wants an echocardiogram and other tests
- Echocardiogram: to measure chamber sizes and ejection fraction (EF), look for dilated cardiomyopathy, valve problems, pericardial disease, and estimate pulmonary pressures. The results guide treatment and prognosis.  
- ECG: to look for ischemia, prior infarction, arrhythmia, or conduction disease.  
- Blood tests (BNP/NT‑proBNP, troponin, basic metabolic panel, renal function, liver function tests, coagulation tests, CBC): to confirm heart‑failure physiology, assess severity, look for organ dysfunction (congestive hepatopathy vs chronic liver disease), and guide safe use of therapies.  
- Other possible tests: viral/hepatitis serologies, iron studies, TSH, and, if ischemia is suspected, stress testing or coronary angiography.

Typical immediate/hospital treatments you might receive
- Diuretics (usually IV loop diuretics) to remove excess fluid and relieve breathlessness and congestion.  
- Oxygen if you are hypoxic and monitoring of vital signs and urine output.  
- Depending on blood pressure and findings, vasodilators (e.g., nitrates) or inotropes may be used in selected patients.  
- Address reversible causes/precipitants (arrhythmia, ischemia, infection, uncontrolled alcohol use).  
- Early cardiology consultation and an inpatient echocardiogram.

Longer‑term management points
- If EF is reduced (HFrEF), guideline medications that reduce morbidity and mortality include ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or ARNI), beta‑blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors once stabilized. Device therapy (ICD or CRT) is considered in selected patients with low EF after a period of optimized therapy.  
- Abstaining from alcohol and stopping smoking are very important; alcoholic cardiomyopathy can improve with sustained abstinence.  
- Salt restriction, fluid management, vaccination (influenza, pneumococcus), and cardiac rehabilitation as advised by cardiology.

What to watch for now (seek urgent care)
- Worsening shortness of breath, difficulty breathing at rest, fainting, chest pain, confusion, very low blood pressure, or decreased urine output — these require immediate medical attention.

Next steps you should expect
- Echocardiogram during this admission or soon after, review of blood tests (including LFTs), cardiology assessment, and a plan for diuretics and other heart‑failure therapies based on the echo and labs. Discuss alcohol cessation support with your team.

Uterine rupture,E,Placenta previa,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Placenta previa — painless, bright red bleeding in late pregnancy is classic. Your history of a prior lower-segment cesarean increases the risk.

What needs to be done now (urgent steps)
1. Do NOT perform a digital vaginal exam until placenta previa is excluded (risk of provoking severe hemorrhage). A speculum exam is safer if needed to look for obvious cervical/vaginal lesions.  
2. Urgent ultrasound (transabdominal, followed by transvaginal if available) to locate the placenta and rule out placenta previa or vasa previa.  
3. Continuous fetal heart-rate monitoring and close maternal vital-sign observation.  
4. Establish IV access, send type-and-screen/crossmatch and CBC, and have blood available if bleeding recurs.  
5. Give Rho(D) immunoglobulin if you are Rh-negative.  
6. If placenta previa is confirmed, assess for placenta accreta (history of prior C-section raises risk) — consult maternal–fetal medicine and consider MRI if accreta suspected.  
7. Admit for observation and plan delivery based on findings: if bleeding recurs, is heavy, or the fetus or mother becomes unstable → immediate delivery (usually cesarean for placenta previa). If stable and bleeding has stopped, inpatient monitoring, pelvic rest, and planned delivery with obstetric team.

Additional management considerations
- Corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity may be considered if delivery is likely before 37 weeks (discuss with your obstetrician).  
- Magnesium for neuroprotection is only indicated at much earlier gestations (<32 weeks).  
- If placenta previa is confirmed and you need cesarean delivery, prior cesarean increases the chance of significant hemorrhage and of placenta accreta — multidisciplinary surgical planning (obstetrics, anesthesia, blood bank, possibly urology/interventional radiology) may be needed.

Defective swallowing reflex G. Normal post C-section status
""",A,Esophageal atresia,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) — most commonly the proximal esophageal blind pouch with a distal TEF (Type C).  
  Reason: polyhydramnios (AFI 26) suggests the fetus could not swallow amniotic fluid; newborn with excessive drooling/foaming, choking/coughing, cyanosis that does not improve with crying are classic for EA/TEF with risk of aspiration.

Immediate actions (first minutes)
1. Clear airway and prevent ongoing aspiration: continuous oropharyngeal suctioning.  
2. NPO. Do not attempt feeding.  
3. Insert a wide-bore orogastric (or nasogastric) tube gently until resistance — if it coils in the upper pouch this supports EA. Leave tube open to continuous suction to decompress the blind pouch.  
4. Position upright/semi-upright to reduce aspiration.  
5. Give supplemental oxygen and support ventilation as needed. If positive-pressure ventilation is required be cautious (gastric distension can worsen respiratory compromise if a distal fistula is present) — decompress stomach first.  
6. IV access, start fluids. Give broad-spectrum antibiotics if aspiration pneumonitis/infection is suspected.  
7. Admit to NICU and urgently consult pediatric surgery and neonatology.

Confirmatory investigations
- Chest and abdominal radiograph with the NG/OG tube in place: NG tube coiling in upper chest + air in stomach/bowel indicates distal TEF.  
- Baseline labs, blood gas, and chest x‑ray to assess aspiration.  
- Echocardiogram and screening for other congenital anomalies (VACTERL association) prior to definitive repair.

Definitive management
- Surgical repair: ligation of the fistula and primary esophageal anastomosis (timing depends on stability, but usually done urgently/early). Postop care includes aspiration precautions, possible tube feeds, surveillance for leaks, strictures, and GERD.

Prognosis/complications
- Depends on associated anomalies and degree of aspiration/pulmonary injury. Early recognition, airway protection, decompression, and prompt surgical repair markedly improve outcomes.

249,"I am a 28-year-old man who recently sought a referral to a dermatologist due to an issue I have been experiencing for the past two months.

I initially tried some over-the-counter products based on recommendations from my hair stylist, but unfortunately, I did not see any improvement. It's important to note that I do not intentionally pull my hair out. 

When I visited the dermatologist, a physical examination was conducted, revealing no signs of inflammation or redness in the scalp. Additionally, a Wood’s lamp examination showed no fluorescence, which was reassuring. To further investigate the situation, a punch biopsy was performed, which indicated a peribulbar lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate surrounding the hair follicles, resembling what was described to me as a ""swarm of bees."" This information was shared with me, and I am now awaiting further guidance on the most likely diagnosis and appropriate treatment options.",A. Tinea capitis B. Telogen effluvium C. Lichen planopilaris D. Androgenic alopecia E. Alopecia areata,E,Alopecia areata,neutral,"Most likely diagnosis
- Alopecia areata. The sudden, smooth circular patches of non‑scarring hair loss together with a punch biopsy showing a dense peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate (“swarm of bees”) is classic for autoimmune alopecia areata.

What that means
- It is an autoimmune attack on hair follicles causing patchy hair loss. It is non‑scarring, so hair can regrow. Some cases remit spontaneously; others persist or progress. Nail pitting and other autoimmune conditions (especially thyroid disease) can be associated.

Typical treatment options (brief)
- For limited patchy disease (common in adults):
  - Intralesional corticosteroid injections (first‑line for many adult patients): triamcinolone acetonide (commonly 2.5–10 mg/mL; many clinicians use ~5 mg/mL), 0.1 mL per injection spaced ~1 cm apart, repeat every 4–8 weeks. Effective and fast; local skin atrophy is a possible side effect.
  - High‑potency topical corticosteroids (e.g., clobetasol 0.05% ointment/solution) applied daily to twice daily if injections are not acceptable.
  - Topical minoxidil 5% (foam or solution) as an adjunct to promote regrowth.
- For more extensive, rapidly progressive, or refractory disease:
  - Topical immunotherapy (e.g., DPCP) or systemic therapies.
  - Systemic corticosteroids (short courses or pulses) are sometimes used for rapid progression.
  - Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors: oral agents (e.g., baricitinib — approved for severe alopecia areata in adults; tofacitinib and ruxolitinib are used off‑label) and topical formulations have shown strong efficacy. These require specialist oversight and baseline/ongoing bloodwork and counseling about infection, lipid, and thrombotic risks.
- Cosmetic/supportive measures: camouflage powders, wigs, eyebrow/eyelash options; psychological support if needed.

Recommended next steps for you
1. Discuss intralesional steroid injections with your dermatologist — often the most practical and effective first step for patchy alopecia areata in adults.  
2. Ask about adding topical minoxidil and/or a high‑potency topical steroid if injections are not feasible.  
3. Get baseline screening for associated conditions (thyroid function tests are commonly checked).  
4. If disease is extensive or progressing, ask about systemic therapy or referral to a clinic experienced with JAK inhibitors to discuss risks/benefits.
