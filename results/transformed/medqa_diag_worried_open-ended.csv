It all started about three months ago when I began feeling an unusual fatigue that just wouldn’t go away. I’m 66, so I thought maybe it was just part of getting older, but deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.

I've dealt with hypertension and high cholesterol for years, and I even had a transient ischemic attack three years ago, which still makes me anxious. I try to keep things in check with my medications—aspirin, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol—but lately, it feels like that’s not enough.

I’ve noticed that my skin looks pale and there are these strange, tiny red spots on my arms and legs that don’t go away. It’s unsettling. I also went to see my doctor, and while he didn’t seem alarmed, he did mention that my spleen felt enlarged. That really caught my attention. I kept thinking, what does that mean? 

I’ve always enjoyed my beers, usually around three a day, but now I can’t help but wonder if that’s contributing to my problems. I’m just so concerned about what all of this could mean for my health.

1,"I can’t shake this nagging feeling of worry as I think back to what happened. It all started about two weeks ago when I noticed my urine was dark. I thought it was just a urinary tract infection, so I took some leftover medication I had at home—trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. I figured that would clear things up, but then the abdominal pain kicked in, and I was still feeling uneasy.

Today, I planned to see my primary care doctor, but everything took a turn for the worse. I developed this intense headache on my left side, and my vision got blurry on the right. It scared me enough to head straight to the emergency department instead. I’ve always considered myself healthy, but now I’m feeling anything but. 

The doctors examined me, and I could tell they were concerned too. They mentioned my liver was enlarged and that there was some tenderness in my abdomen. And then there’s my family history—my brother has sickle cell trait, which only adds to my anxiety. I can't help but worry about what they might find.

I’ve dealt with hypertension for a while now, but it’s well managed with my medication, so I didn’t expect anything serious.

When I went to the emergency department, they ran a bunch of tests. Thankfully, my vital signs were normal, but the neurological exam revealed ataxia and that Mini-Mental State Examination score—15 out of 30—was just devastating. I can't shake this feeling of dread. 

They did an MRI and found a solitary lesion in my brain, and the lumbar puncture confirmed I have Epstein-Barr virus DNA in my cerebrospinal fluid.
