1,"Shortly after my birth, I began to experience tachypnea and retractions, with a respiratory rate of 90 breaths per minute. Despite these symptoms, I did not show any signs of cyanosis and appeared active without looking ill. My delivery took place via cesarean section at 38 weeks, following an uneventful pregnancy, and I was subsequently placed under observation in intensive care.

During my time in the unit, blood gas analysis indicated that I was not retaining CO2, and there were no other concerning findings such as fever or rash. The medical team assessed my condition and considered several management options. They weighed the possibility that my symptoms could be benign and self-limiting versus potential concerns like pneumonia or sepsis.

Ultimately, the medical team determined that my condition was likely transient tachypnea of the newborn and did not require any specific treatment or antibiotics. I continued to be monitored closely to ensure my well-being as I adjusted to life outside the womb.","A. Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation is the first-line management B. The condition is benign and self-limiting, requiring no specific treatment C. This is hard to distinguish from pneumonia and sepsis so empirical antibiotics are given for 48 hours after birth until sepsis is ruled out D. Surfactant deficiency is the underlying cause, so surfactant therapy is required E. This is most likely transient tachypnea of the newborn and requires no antibiotics F. Tachypnea in this case is likely due to a congenital heart defect, so echocardiography is indicated G. ABG is needed to monitor  and it is normal to have CO2 retention H.

389,"I am a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic smoking, type 2 diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension. Recently, I presented for a preoperative risk evaluation before undergoing repair of a 5.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. During my assessment, I denied experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, or any anginal symptoms while at rest. However, I reported limited mobility due to severe knee osteoarthritis, which requires me to use a wheelchair; I can only walk less than one block before needing to stop.

At the time of examination, my blood pressure was recorded at 117/82 mm Hg, my heart rate was 72 beats per minute, and my respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute. My oxygen saturation was 94% on room air, and my BMI was noted to be 37. The examination revealed normal jugular venous pressure, clear lungs upon auscultation, and a regular cardiac rhythm without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal palpation indicated a pulsatile mass, but there was no hepatosplenomegaly. My lower extremities exhibited normal strength with no edema, although both knees had reduced range of motion.

390,"I am a 72-year-old man with a history of dementia, and I was brought in by my daughter due to an increase in my agitation. Last week, my primary care physician performed a thorough evaluation, which included laboratory and imaging studies, and the results were unremarkable. Despite my agitation, I found it difficult to articulate any specific pain or discomfort I was experiencing.

During an osteopathic structural examination, the practitioner palpated my skull and noted that the greater wings of my sphenoid felt superior compared to the occiput, which was noted to feel inferior during the vault hold. This examination raised questions about my cranial function, particularly in relation to potential dysfunctions or strains in the cranial base.

The findings from the examination led to considerations of various cranial issues that could be present in my condition. The practitioner discussed the possibility of dysfunctions such as cranial base strain, torsional strain patterns, and deviations at the sphenobasilar synchondrosis. Each of these possibilities was explored to better understand the source of my increased agitation and to guide further treatment.",A. Dysfunction of the tentorium cerebelli due to cranial base strain B. Torsional strain pattern with left sphenoid rotation C. Superior deviation of the occiput at the sphenobasilar synchondrosis D.

392,"I am a 37-year-old man who recently arrived at the emergency department with my wife. For the past three days, I have been experiencing severe pain in my right arm, which I am unable to move. The discomfort started after I woke up one morning, having slept on my side. Generally, I consider myself healthy, but I have been feeling extremely fatigued due to multiple night shifts at work. This fatigue has made it difficult for me to stay awake while caring for my daughter during the day.

Since the pain began, I have been unable to work and have become fully dependent on my wife, who has taken on extra work to help us manage our expenses. Although I appear calm, I only agreed to an examination after my wife encouraged me to do so. During the examination, my vital signs were normal, but the doctor noted that I had very limited muscle strength in my right arm. While my reflexes were normal, I could not feel light touches on my arm and forearm. However, I did react quickly to a pinprick test.
