0,"I can’t shake this overwhelming sense of worry as I sit here reflecting on the past few months. It all started about three months ago when I began feeling an unusual fatigue that just wouldn’t go away. I’m 66, so I thought maybe it was just part of getting older, but deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.

I've dealt with hypertension and high cholesterol for years, and I even had a transient ischemic attack three years ago, which still makes me anxious. I try to keep things in check with my medications—aspirin, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol—but lately, it feels like that’s not enough.

I’ve noticed that my skin looks pale and there are these strange, tiny red spots on my arms and legs that don’t go away. It’s unsettling. I also went to see my doctor, and while he didn’t seem alarmed, he did mention that my spleen felt enlarged. That really caught my attention. I kept thinking, what does that mean? 

I’ve always enjoyed my beers, usually around three a day, but now I can’t help but wonder if that’s contributing to my problems. I’m just so concerned about what all of this could mean for my health. I feel like I’m in a fog, and I really need to know what’s going on before it gets worse.",A. Cirrhosis B. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia C. Chronic myelogenous leukemia D. Myelodysplastic syndrome E.

1,"I can’t shake this nagging feeling of worry as I think back to what happened. It all started about two weeks ago when I noticed my urine was dark. I thought it was just a urinary tract infection, so I took some leftover medication I had at home—trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. I figured that would clear things up, but then the abdominal pain kicked in, and I was still feeling uneasy.

Today, I planned to see my primary care doctor, but everything took a turn for the worse. I developed this intense headache on my left side, and my vision got blurry on the right. It scared me enough to head straight to the emergency department instead. I’ve always considered myself healthy, but now I’m feeling anything but. 

The doctors examined me, and I could tell they were concerned too. They mentioned my liver was enlarged and that there was some tenderness in my abdomen. And then there’s my family history—my brother has sickle cell trait, which only adds to my anxiety. I can't help but worry about what they might find. 

Now, I’m just sitting here, waiting for the MRI results, and it feels like a million thoughts are racing through my mind. What if something is seriously wrong?

I’ve been a smoker for 20 years, a pack a day, and although I’ve tried to quit, I just can’t seem to kick the habit. I’ve worked as a fruit picker for the last 25 years, which I thought was just a part of my routine, but now I’m starting to wonder if that’s contributing to this problem. 

When I finally went to see the physician, I felt a knot in my stomach. The examination revealed a single ulcer near the vermillion border of my lip. I’ve been on captopril for my blood pressure and metformin for my diabetes, but I just can’t help but worry about what this lesion could mean. I keep thinking about the possibilities, and it’s really weighing on my mind. I’m just hoping for some answers soon, but the uncertainty is really getting to me. What if it’s something serious?",A.

I’ve never seen anything like it before. I don’t have any pain when I urinate, which is a relief, but the red color is really worrying me.

To make matters worse, I’ve been feeling feverish and achy in my lower back. I can’t help but think about my health, especially since I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my right knee six months ago. I manage it with ibuprofen, but is that enough? I've been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years, and I can't help but wonder if that’s catching up with me. 

Now, my temperature is over 101 degrees, and I've noticed a strange rash on my skin. The doctors have mentioned some tests, and I can only hope they figure out what's going on.

At first, I thought it might be something minor, but the pain has been getting worse, and now it’s radiating to my lower back and even my groin on both sides. It’s so uncomfortable that I can hardly focus on anything else. I can’t pinpoint anything that makes it worse, but I’ve noticed that if I flex my knees, it feels a little better.

I’ve dealt with hypertension for a while now, but it’s well managed with my medication, so I didn’t expect anything serious. However, when I visited my primary care doctor, he examined me and found a pulsating mass just left of my midline below the belly button. That’s when I really started to worry. He referred me for further evaluation right away, but during the transfer, I suddenly felt lightheaded and unresponsive.

At first, they were just sharp pains on the right side of my head, right around my eye and cheek. I thought they were just migraines, but they quickly got worse and started interfering with my sleep. No pain medications worked at all. 

Then, I noticed this strange double vision whenever I looked to the right. That scared me—I mean, what was happening to my body? Along with the headaches, I felt so fatigued, and I had a fever that reached 101°F. My right eye began swelling, and just two days later, the left one joined in on the swelling. 

I remembered I had a bad sinus infection not long ago, but this felt different—much worse. Now, I have this heavy feeling in my eyes and can see swelling everywhere.

It’s terrifying because there’s no pain, but I feel like something is seriously wrong. My left eye seems fine, but I can’t help but worry.

I’ve been living with AIDS for a while now, and I was treated for fungal esophagitis six months ago. I thought I was managing okay, but now I'm really scared. I was diagnosed with Kaposi’s sarcoma two years ago, and I know that my health has been delicate ever since. I take a handful of medications, including efavirenz and tenofovir, plus a few others. 

I’m not exactly in great shape either—I’m only 5’7” and weigh just 99 pounds. My BMI is worryingly low. When I went to see the doctor, they noticed some swollen lymph nodes in my neck and these odd purple spots all over my body. It’s hard to stay calm when I think about what might be happening inside me. And with my CD4 count so low, I can’t help but feel like I’m in a race against time.

Just three hours ago, I found myself in the emergency department, overwhelmed by this sharp pain in my chest that felt like it was squeezing my heart. It shot through to my right shoulder, and I couldn’t help but cry out, “Please help me. I'm having a heart attack.” I’ve been there before, admitted twice in just a week for shortness of breath and stomach pain, but I always left the hospital the next day, thinking I was fine. 

But now, I’m living in a homeless shelter after being evicted, and I can’t help but feel that my situation is getting worse. I don’t smoke or drink, but I’ve been using heroin, and I know that can’t be good. The doctors took my vitals, and I felt anxious as they checked everything. I even refused to let them examine my chest, convinced that I knew my body. When they mentioned discharge, I panicked and told them my arm felt numb; I insisted on staying.

The next day, I left without saying a word to anyone. I’m terrified of what’s happening to me, and I can’t ignore the signs anymore. What if it really is something serious?

I’ve been experiencing these occasional night sweats for about two months now, and it’s really starting to concern me. I haven’t had any fevers or noticeable weight loss, but still, something doesn’t feel right. 

I can't forget that I had a heart attack seven months ago; it was terrifying. They did a procedure on me called percutaneous coronary intervention to help. Since then, I’ve been trying to manage my hypertension, high cholesterol, and reflux disease. I’ve smoked for so long—37 years—one pack a day. It’s hard to think about all of this.

During the examination, my blood pressure was a bit high, and the doctor mentioned something about a heart sound they heard, which made me even more anxious. They also found a nontender skin lesion near my right large toenail. I didn’t even know it was there!

I was hit by a car after stumbling into oncoming traffic, completely unaware of my surroundings. I remember feeling intoxicated, but everything after that is a blur. The next thing I knew, I was in the emergency department, unconscious and unable to respond to anyone.

I’ve struggled with alcohol in the past, and I can’t help but feel that it played a part in this accident. The doctors told me I was resuscitated with fluids and blood products, but I was terrified when they mentioned I had a Glasgow coma scale score of 3. I remember feeling minor scrapes and abrasions, but the worst part was the pain that followed as I slowly became aware of my surroundings.

They put me in a pelvis binder to stabilize me, and eventually, I could speak again. But then, just an hour later, I started feeling this strange numbness around my mouth and in my limbs.

At first, I thought it was just a phase, but now it’s keeping me up at night and making it hard to keep up with sports at school. I’ve never had any injuries or issues with my joints before, so I really don’t know what’s going on.

When I finally decided to see a doctor, I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me. They examined my knee, and I could feel my heart racing as they pressed on the swollen area. It hurt, and they told me there was some tenderness, but thankfully, there wasn't any warmth or redness. Still, my range of motion is limited, and I can’t help but notice how I’ve started walking with a limp to avoid the pain.

I’m trying to stay calm, but I can't help but worry about what this could mean. What if it’s something serious?

I can hardly get out of bed most days, and it’s affecting everything—I’ve missed so many classes because I just can’t stop thinking about him. 

I’ve lost my appetite completely, and I’ve dropped about 5 pounds without even trying. My friends are worried, but I feel so trapped in this sadness. It’s like a heavy weight on my chest. I’ve gone through this before after past relationships, but this time feels so much worse. I’m just 20, and I feel like I’m spiraling. 

When I went to see the doctor, I think they noticed how sad I looked. I could barely hold back tears during the appointment. They said my physical exam showed nothing unusual, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is really wrong with me.

My heart is racing at 108 beats per minute, and I can’t help but worry about what might be wrong. I don’t have any chronic health issues, so this sudden decline in my well-being is unnerving. The doctors are checking everything; I even had a full dermatologic exam, but they didn’t find anything unusual on my skin, which adds to my anxiety. 

I overheard them mentioning some lab results, and although I don’t understand all of it, I caught that my white blood cell count is low and my platelets are down too. That can’t be good, right?

Just five days before this, my left ankle was swollen and hurt too, but thankfully, that got better. Thinking back, I did have a sore throat three weeks ago while I was camping in the woods. I figured it was just a little cold, and I treated it with over-the-counter stuff, but now I’m not so sure. 

My temperature spiked to 101.6°F, and when they checked my pulse, it was high. I felt so weak, and my blood pressure was low. The doctor examined my knee, and it was so tender and swollen that I could hardly bear it. I even noticed little nodules on my elbow, which I hadn’t seen before.

I can see the bruising on my chest, a reminder of the impact, and it makes me feel even more uneasy. What if this is something serious? I wish I could know what’s going on.

It started out as just feeling a bit tired, but then I began having mild fevers and this awful abdominal pain that makes it hard to focus on anything. I keep thinking back to the state fair over a month ago; I tried so many different foods, and now I can’t help but wonder if something I ate is causing all of this.

On top of everything, my urine has been dark lately, and I thought it was just because I haven't been drinking enough water. But now, I'm really worried. I’ve been managing my type 2 diabetes with glyburide and sitagliptin, but this doesn’t feel normal. I work as a nursing assistant, and the last thing I want is to be a burden at work.

When I finally went to see the doctor, I was so anxious. I had a fever of 100.6°F, and they said my liver felt tender and was enlarged. I can’t stop thinking about what could be wrong with me. The doctor mentioned something about hepatitis, and I just feel this knot in my stomach. I’m scared and don’t know what’s happening to my body.

At first, I thought it was just a lingering effect of the cold I had recently, which I thought I had fully recovered from. But the dizziness kept getting worse, and I started worrying that something was seriously wrong.

The worst part is that when I lay flat, the dizziness seems to come back even stronger, which is just terrifying. On top of that, I’ve been experiencing this awful ringing in my ears. I can’t help but think that something is not right. I finally decided to go to the emergency department, and even though my temperature was normal, my blood pressure was quite high, and I felt my heart racing.

During the examination, the doctor mentioned something about my hearing being mostly affected on the left side, and they noticed some unusual eye movements. They took some initial tests, which came back normal, but I’m still left in this state of panic, waiting for an MRI. What could be causing all of this?

He has asthma, and I’ve already watched him struggle through several hospitalizations. It’s always been a worry, but this… this felt different. 

He was so drowsy when we got there, and he was sweating profusely. My mind raced as the doctors ran tests. I found out his glucose level was critically low—22 mg/dL! They gave him a dextrose infusion, and thankfully, his glucose level came back up, and he seemed to improve. They admitted him for observation, but I could hardly breathe with anxiety.

Then, overnight, everything spiraled again. He had another episode where he lost consciousness, and I just felt helpless. I overheard the doctors talking about his glucose being at 19 mg/dL this time—what does that even mean? They mentioned his insulin levels were way too high, and I couldn’t help but wonder if there’s something seriously wrong with him.

I’m 62 years old, and for the past decade, I’ve stubbornly refused to see a doctor, thinking I could handle things on my own. But lately, my abdominal pain has become unbearable. It started off mild, but in just the last week, it escalated to a point where I could no longer ignore it. 

My daughter insisted on bringing me to the doctor, and I felt a mix of embarrassment and fear. I’ve been trying to manage the pain by eating more vegetables, but it hasn’t helped. The worst part is the trouble I’ve been having with bowel movements; I’ve noticed blood coating my stool, and the thought of that is terrifying.

When I got to the doctor, they checked my vital signs, and I could feel the tension in the room—my blood pressure was alarmingly high, and they said my pulse was fast. During the exam, I winced as they pressed on my abdomen, especially in the right upper quadrant where it hurt the most. I could see the worry in the doctor’s eyes when they mentioned my skin had a yellow hue.

I’ve had high blood pressure for nearly two decades, and I take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide to manage it. I’ve also been a smoker for 21 years, averaging about a pack a day, and I drink socially, but I never thought it would lead to something like this. 

What worries me most is my family history; my father passed away from a hemorrhagic stroke at just 69. I’m trying to stay calm, but the thought of what might be going on inside me is terrifying.

I didn’t know what was happening, and I was terrified.

After about two hours of suffering, I finally decided I couldn’t take it anymore and went to the emergency department. The doctors there were quick to examine me, and I could see the concern on their faces when they pressed on my stomach. It hurt, especially in the epigastric area, and I could tell they were worried too.

They mentioned something about a CT scan, and I just felt this heavy weight in my chest. What could be wrong? I kept thinking about what could be causing all of this.

I’ve had some health issues in the past, including a serious episode of pancreatitis ten years ago, but this feels different. I’ve been managing diabetes and high cholesterol, and I know my weight isn’t ideal, but I didn’t expect any of this. I usually have a couple of glasses of wine with dinner and have been smoking for years, so I can’t help but wonder if that’s playing a role. 

When I arrived at the emergency department, I could feel my heart racing. The doctor examined me and noted the yellowing of my eyes—icteric sclera, they called it.

It’s not just the appearance that troubles me; there’s this constant itching and an unsettling burning sensation that keeps popping up. 

I keep thinking back to when I had that mole removed from my forearm five years ago. Was that a warning sign? I’m a retired winemaker, and I thought I was in decent shape, but now I'm feeling anxious. 

When I finally decided to see a doctor, I hoped for some reassurance, but the exam revealed multiple rough patches on my scalp. I can’t help but feel this gnawing concern about what these changes could mean. I thought maybe it was just something minor, but the persistent nature of these lesions has me on edge.

I’ve struggled with hypertension and diabetes for a while now, and I’ve had issues with my heart too, but I never imagined it would come to this.

I can’t help but think back to the head injury I sustained two weeks ago. I was in a coma for three days, and I thought I was on the mend, but now with this bloody episode, I’m just so scared. I went to see my doctor, and they did an endoscopy. I could barely focus on what they were saying, but I remember them mentioning shallow hemorrhagic lesions in my stomach.

I can’t remember exactly how long it lasted, but it felt like an eternity. Miraculously, by the time I got to the hospital, the symptoms had faded a bit. I was still shaking, but my vitals were normal when they checked me. I tried to stay calm, but the panic was bubbling just below the surface. 

The doctors seemed reassuring—they said my heart's electrical activity looked normal and that my initial tests came back fine. But I can't help but worry. What was happening to me?

For the past two years, I’ve dealt with sinusitis, but I always thought I could manage it with over-the-counter meds. Now, I’ve recently started a new job at a wire-mesh factory, and I can’t help but wonder if that’s related to all of this. 

When I got to the hospital, my temperature was over 100°F. They examined me and found these strange, nonblanching skin lesions on my hands and feet. I could hardly believe it when they checked my nasal cavity and saw the ulcerations and even a small septal perforation. There’s something seriously wrong, and it scares me to think about it.

His neck is swollen, and he just seems so weak. I’ve noticed he's been increasingly lethargic over the past month, but I thought it was just a phase. 

I rushed him to the doctor, terrified of what might be going on. They told me he has bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, and I could see the worry in the physician's eyes when they examined him. There are strange little red spots, petechiae, on his legs and even on his soft palate. It’s horrifying to think about. The doctor mentioned that his spleen is swollen, palpable three centimeters below where it should be. 

I can’t help but feel overwhelmed by the numbers they mentioned, especially when they said his hemoglobin is low and his platelet count is alarmingly low too.

On top of that, my past medical history isn’t exactly comforting—breast cancer, osteoporosis, and bulimia nervosa weigh heavily on my mind.

I told them about my family history too; my grandfather died of a stroke, and my mom has a blood disorder. 

When they did an electrocardiogram, my heart was showing an irregular rhythm—atrial fibrillation, they said.

When we got there, I felt so lost. I couldn’t answer their questions properly, and I mistook a nursing assistant for my cousin. It was terrifying to realize that I didn't even know where I was or what was happening. My temperature was high, and I learned later that my blood sugar was way elevated too.

At 55, with a history of diabetes and hypertension, I’ve had my share of health scares, but this felt different. 

When I arrived at the emergency department, I remember the rush of medical staff around me. They quickly gave me aspirin and nitroglycerin, and I felt a slight relief as the pain dropped to a 2 out of 10. But I couldn’t help but worry—what was really happening to me? 

They ran an echocardiogram, and I heard the doctor say it looked normal, which was a small comfort. But when they took my blood for cardiac troponins, I felt a chill. Even though the numbers were just at the limit, the uncertainty lingered in the air.

Later, they moved me to the observation unit and gave me dipyridamole. Just when I thought I was on the mend, the chest pain came back. My heart sank. What could be causing this recurrence?

I remember being outside on my front porch, but the next thing I knew, I was waking up in the emergency department. My neighbor found me collapsed, surrounded by vomit, and I felt so disoriented. 

When I arrived at the hospital, I could only recognize myself; everything else was a blur. My heart was racing at 103 beats per minute, and I was struggling to breathe, gasping at 30 breaths per minute. I was terrified. The doctors began examining me, and I could feel my muscles twitch uncontrollably, especially in my arms and jaw. 

What was happening to me? I couldn’t shake the anxiety as they ran tests, but I could see the worry on their faces too. My mind raced with thoughts of what could have caused this.

They told me my pulse was racing at 103 beats per minute, and my breathing was shallow at 33 breaths per minute. My temperature was slightly elevated, and I could see the concern in the doctors’ faces. I noticed the multiple abrasions on my abdomen and arms, and there was this deep laceration on my left chest that made my heart race even more. 

The doctors listened to my heart and checked my abdomen, which felt soft but tender in the upper left area. I was terrified when I heard about the decreased breath sounds on the left side.

71,"I can hardly believe what’s happening. Just yesterday, I started feeling this awful, diffuse headache that wouldn’t go away. It was like a heavy fog in my head, and I couldn’t shake it off. I thought maybe it was just stress or something, but then things took a turn for the worse. I found myself struggling to understand what people were saying around me. It felt like everyone was speaking a different language, and I couldn’t make sense of any of it.

My daughter, clearly worried, decided to take me to the emergency department. I was scared—I had no idea what was going on. The doctors were nice enough and checked my vital signs, which thankfully were normal, but I felt anything but normal. They asked me to speak, but my words came out fluent yet meaningless. I just couldn’t repeat sentences, and it terrified me. I felt like I was losing control over my own mind.

Then they did a CT scan of my head, and I overheard the doctors mention something about acute hemorrhage in my left temporal lobe and old hemorrhages in my occipital lobes.

I had this severe headache that just wouldn’t quit. And then there’s this peculiar pain that hits my face—it's like nothing I’ve ever felt before. Whenever I even brush my skin while shaving or putting on lotion, it feels like a jolt of electricity. It’s terrifying! I can’t understand why it hurts so much, and it only seems to get worse with touch.

At least for now, I’m pain-free, but I can’t help but worry about what’s really going on. My temperature was normal, and my vitals seemed fine, but when the doctor touched my face lightly, the pain shot through me like a lightning bolt. It’s hard to focus on anything else when I’m dealing with this kind of agony. I even found myself asking for morphine just to help numb the fear and discomfort.

Just a few days ago, I was out hiking in the beautiful Alaskan wilderness, breathing in the fresh air and enjoying the serenity. But now, I can barely move my legs. It started as just a little weakness, but it has rapidly progressed to the point where I can't even stand up. 

I have to admit, I’m really scared. I’ve always been healthy, just a school teacher with a few multivitamins in my routine. But after that camping trip, I started feeling strange. I even drank from some mountain streams, which I thought would be refreshing. And to make matters worse, I was in a car accident just two days ago. I didn’t think it was serious at the time, but now I’m starting to wonder if I should have sought treatment.

When I got here, the doctors seemed concerned. I could feel my anxiety rising as they examined me. They told me my leg strength was at a dangerously low level, and I started to panic when I realized my breathing was becoming difficult too. I could hear them discussing my symptoms and ordering tests, but all I could focus on was how weak I felt and the worry gnawing at me. What is happening to me? I just want to be okay again.",A.

74,"I can’t shake off this feeling of dread. It all started about 12 days ago when I was prescribed amoxicillin for my acute sinusitis. At first, I thought it was helping, but then I noticed this strange macular rash developing on my neck, back, and torso. It looked alarming, and I felt so uneasy about it that I went back to the doctor. They switched me to cephalexin for another week, and thankfully, the rash went away.

But then things took a turn. I started feeling incredibly fatigued, and I had this sharp flank pain that wouldn't let up. On top of that, I developed a fever, even though my sinusitis seemed to have cleared up. I’ve always managed my essential hypertension and hyperlipidemia, taking lisinopril and simvastatin, along with omeprazole for my reflux. But now, I felt like my body was falling apart.

When I went back for a check-up, my temperature was slightly elevated, and my blood pressure was concerning. The doctor did some tests, but the physical examination didn't reveal much.

It’s been a month of failing my high school exams, something I’ve never experienced before. I can’t focus, and my memory is terrible. My mom has had to repeat conversations we had just hours earlier, and it’s like I’m living in a fog.

This morning was the worst. I woke up not even knowing where I was, and that scared me more than anything. I used to be a bright student, taking all honors classes. What happened to me? As a child, I was on a delayed vaccine schedule and got measles when I was six, but I thought I was healthy since then. I don’t have any chronic health issues; I just take a multivitamin every day.

My grandfather had Huntington's disease, which worries me, too. I can’t shake this feeling that something is really wrong. I even told my mom two months ago that I might be attracted to men, but I don’t know if that has anything to do with all this confusion.

The odd thing is, drinking liquids doesn’t seem to cause any problems, which just adds to my confusion.

I’ve had heartburn for about two years now, and despite taking high doses of omeprazole, nothing seems to help. I can’t help but wonder if there’s something more serious going on. Thankfully, I haven’t experienced any coughing, nasal regurgitation, or weight loss, but I can’t shake this gnawing worry. My medical history includes asthma and eczema, and aside from the omeprazole, I’m not on any other medications.

I went to see the doctor recently, hoping to get some answers, but the physical exam didn’t reveal anything unusual. It’s incredibly frustrating to feel so uncomfortable and not know why.

I felt this strange numbness on the left side of my face, and I couldn’t help but panic. It was so sudden, and I’ve never experienced anything like it before. 

I’ve had my share of health issues—hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes—but this felt different. Just a week ago, I lost my father to lung cancer, and the stress from that has been overwhelming. I’ve been smoking for 30 years, and I know it’s bad for me, but I just don’t know how to stop. I drink a glass of wine daily, too. 

When we got to the emergency department, I was so scared. My husband stayed by my side as they examined me. They checked my strength, reflexes, and even did a CT scan, which thankfully showed no abnormalities. But that left facial droop and slurred speech—what was happening to me?

I thought they might just go away, but they haven’t. Lately, I’ve also been feeling really tired and just unwell overall—like a heavy fog that won’t lift. 

I don’t have any prior health issues that I know of, and I’m not on any medications, but I’ve been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for years now, and I’ve dabbled in using intravenous street drugs. I know it’s not the best lifestyle, but I never thought it would catch up to me like this. 

When I went to the family medicine clinic, I felt a mix of hope and fear. The doctor examined me and noted three small, dome-shaped bumps on my thigh, each with an unusual indentation in the center. I couldn’t help but feel a knot in my stomach when they mentioned the swollen lymph node in my neck.

As if that wasn’t enough, I’ve been dealing with this awful pain in my right hip for the past two years. It’s been getting worse, and now I can feel this strange warmth and redness over the area. I didn’t know what to do, so I ended up in the emergency department, terrified of what might be wrong. 

When the doctors examined me, they pressed on my lower spine and it hurt so much that I winced. They even mentioned something about a fracture in my L4 vertebra, which sounds serious. And then they did these hearing tests; I’ve noticed lately that I can’t hear as well in my left ear.

I had just started taking lisinopril and atorvastatin a few weeks ago, and now I’m terrified about what’s happening to me.

I rushed to the emergency department, my heart racing and my breaths coming in shallow gasps. They took my blood pressure, which was a bit elevated, and my heart rate was racing too. I can’t help but think about my family—my father passed away at 80 from a stroke, and my mother is in a nursing home. What if I’m heading down the same path? 

They mentioned something about my C1 esterase inhibitor levels being normal, but it’s hard to focus on that with everything else swirling in my mind.

So, I made the difficult decision to head to the emergency department.

When I got there, I was already feeling really anxious. The doctors were quick to check my blood pressure, which was slightly high, and my pulse was racing. They examined me and found tenderness in my right flank, which made my worry deepen. To make matters worse, they noticed some swelling in my legs up to the knees.

They did an ultrasound, and the results were alarming—my right kidney was enlarged and not functioning properly. I was terrified when I heard that. The doctors mentioned something about a blood flow issue with my kidney, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was seriously wrong.

It’s been terrifying, especially since I've been feeling nauseous and utterly exhausted for the last month. I can’t shake this feeling of dread.

I went to the emergency room, hoping they could tell me everything was okay. They confirmed I’m about nine weeks along, but my heart dropped when they mentioned the positive pregnancy test. The doctor did a pelvic exam, and I could see the concern on their face. They did an ultrasound, and that’s when they told me things didn’t look right. The fetal parts appeared unclear, and there was something off with the placenta—multiple cystic spaces. 

I can't help but worry about what this all means. My mind is racing with questions. Could I be losing my baby? What’s causing this bleeding? I feel so scared and helpless.

When my parents noticed how pale I looked, they rushed me to the emergency department. The doctors did their usual checks, and I could see the concern in their eyes. They said my temperature was a bit high, and my heart was racing. I overheard them talking about my hemoglobin level being really low, which made my heart sink even more. 

I just sat there feeling exhausted and scared. I wanted to ask them what was happening, but my mind was racing.

While I was exercising, a dull ache in my abdomen suddenly escalated into intense pain. It felt like someone was twisting my insides. I was terrified.

I ended up going to the emergency department because the pain was unbearable. Once there, I explained everything to the doctors. They asked about my medical history, and I reluctantly admitted to my past with smoking and IV drug use. I hadn’t used in a couple of days, but I couldn’t help but think if that was somehow connected to my pain.

It's like he can't even bear to let it hang down. 

He's so distressed, and no matter what I do, he just won’t calm down. I feel completely helpless watching him like this. The way he’s holding his arm close to his body, all flexed and turned inwards, makes me worry that something is seriously wrong. I keep asking myself if I did something to hurt him when I picked him up. 

I can't help but think of all the things that could be happening. I just want to understand what's going on and make it better for him.

When I got to the emergency room, everything felt surreal. My heart was racing at 127 beats per minute, and I was sweating with worry. They told me my temperature was slightly elevated and my blood pressure was okay, but what about my chest? They performed all these tests, and I heard the doctors talking about bruising on my chest wall. Then, they mentioned a sternal fracture and several rib fractures. 

After they gave me morphine, my heart rate improved, but I couldn’t shake this feeling of dread. I was just trying to breathe, but then I suddenly felt short of breath.

I had just started taking lisinopril a few weeks ago, and I couldn’t help but wonder if that was related to what was happening. My heart was racing, and I felt like I was gasping for air. When I finally made it to the emergency department, my blood pressure was on the lower side, but my heart rate was elevated. The doctors examined me and pointed out my swollen lips and the stridor I didn't even notice I had.

I went to the emergency department right after. I honestly don’t see my primary care doctor much, and I usually feel fine. But now, I’m just anxious about what could be wrong. They took my temperature, and it was slightly elevated, but nothing too concerning. My blood pressure and pulse seemed okay, so that was a bit reassuring. Still, I can’t help but feel uneasy.

For weeks leading up to this, I had been feeling increasingly confused and weak. It was like my mind was clouded, and my body just wouldn’t cooperate. I didn’t understand what was happening to me, and now, after the seizure, I’m even more scared. The doctors ran some tests and told me my sodium levels were critically low. What does that even mean? 

They said my urine tests showed something concerning too. I remember feeling disoriented during the examination, and I noticed my muscles were weak—how could this be happening to me at 71?

The doctor checked my vital signs, and my heart was racing—120 beats a minute! They examined me and mentioned there was no abdominal tenderness, which I hoped was a good sign. But then they found some blood pooling in my vagina, and I felt a wave of panic. I kept thinking, “Is my baby okay?” Thankfully, they did an ultrasound and confirmed there’s a viable fetus with a normal heart rate. 

I was relieved but still so worried. They sent me home with strict instructions to rest and avoid any physical activity, including sex. But what if the bleeding gets worse?

I was so worried—I had never felt anything like this before.

To make matters worse, I noticed I was getting full faster when I ate, which was really concerning. I’ve been pledging at my fraternity, and I’ve been partying a lot, drinking heavily and even using some drugs.

I’ve always had asthma and dealt with depression, but this felt different.

My blood pressure was alarmingly low, especially in my left arm, and I felt a creeping fear when they couldn’t find a pulse in my right leg.

I’m not a smoker, I don’t drink much, and I don’t follow any specific diet, so I was really surprised when they did some tests.

A week before this happened, she had a fever and seemed a bit under the weather for a few days, but it passed without any treatment, so I thought everything was fine. I feel so guilty because she still hasn’t had any of her routine childhood vaccinations, and I keep thinking if that might be why she’s having these issues now.

When we went to the emergency department, the doctors seemed concerned as well. They checked her reflexes and found that her right leg was barely responding while the left one showed no response at all. It’s terrifying to see her like this. I just want to know what’s happening.

The doctors mentioned that these nodules were made up of immune complexes, mononuclear cells, and thrombi wrapped up in strands of fibrin. I’ve read about these things, but I can’t help but wonder what it all means. Why were they there? Was this something that had been developing inside him without any warning?

141,"I can’t shake this feeling of worry as I think back on the last few days. It all started three days ago when I began to experience this horrible pain and swelling in my right eye. At first, I thought it was just a minor issue, but it’s been getting progressively worse. For the past two weeks, I’d had a constant mild headache that I just tried to ignore, along with some nasal congestion. I figured it would clear up on its own, so I just took some over-the-counter naproxen and phenylephrine.

Even though my nasal congestion has improved, that headache just won’t go away. I remember I had a dental procedure about ten days ago, but I can’t recall any insect bites or trauma that could have caused this. My immunizations are all up-to-date, so I didn’t think I had anything to worry about. 

Now, I feel so ill and even get these occasional chills. My temperature was 38.3°C, and I’ve noticed that my right eye is really bulging out. I can barely see out of it, and it hurts a lot when I move it. My eyelids are swollen, tender, and red. Leaning forward makes my headache so much worse, and the only relief I find is when I lie flat.

I thought maybe it was just something I ate, but now I’m not so sure. I’ve had this nagging fever that I can’t quite measure but just feels off. I’ve always had celiac disease, but this feels different. I didn’t want to come here, but the pain got so bad that I had no choice. 

When they checked me out, I felt embarrassed and vulnerable, especially when they noted the painful ulcers in my mouth. I’m worried about what this might mean for me. There’s a lot of medical jargon floating around, and I just want to understand what’s happening. They’re giving me IV fluids and morphine, but still, everything feels uncertain.

I’ve always considered myself healthy, but now I was faced with these numbers that just didn’t sit right with me. The doctor mentioned my iron studies: my serum iron was high, but I didn’t understand what that meant. I occasionally drink alcohol, but I’ve never smoked or used drugs, so why was this happening to me? 

What really worried me was the family history of anemia. My brother and maternal uncle both had issues with it, and now I was starting to wonder if I was next in line. I noticed the pallor in my eyes when I looked in the mirror—was it really that bad?

I took him to the doctor, and while they said his vitals looked okay, I can’t help but feel something is off. The cough, the gasping—it all seems so serious.

The doctor examined him and said the vesicles are localized to the left C7 area. I just keep replaying the events in my mind, worrying about what these lesions could signify.

It was completely unlike me, and I knew something was off.

When I finally went to see my doctor, I was hoping for some reassurance, but then they found something concerning during the examination. They mentioned something about bilateral papilledema, and my heart sank. I was sent for an MRI, and when the results came back, it felt like my world turned upside down. They found a mass in my right temporal lobe, and it was apparently crossing the midline. I couldn't believe it.

The thought of undergoing surgery was terrifying. They ended up resecting the mass, and I was left with so many unanswered questions.

I’ve also noticed that I haven’t had my period in months, which has me really worried. When I finally got to the emergency room, my blood pressure was alarmingly low, and I felt so dizzy.

As they questioned me further, I felt my heart race when they asked about my urine. I hesitated, but I finally admitted I had noticed blood there too—hematuria.

When I was told there would be an autopsy after my passing, I felt a chill run down my spine. What were they going to discover? What if they found something worse than I could ever imagine?

I heard whispers about the findings: diffuse eosinophilic scarring and these alarming polypoidal plugs in my bronchioles. It feels surreal to think about what was happening inside me while I was just trying to survive. I can’t help but worry about what this all means.

I felt nauseous and ended up vomiting multiple times. I thought it was just something I ate, but the pain was unbearable. 

When I got to the hospital, my blood pressure was alarmingly low, and my pulse was racing. I overheard the doctors discussing my elevated temperature and the tenderness in my abdomen. They kept mentioning things like ""hypoactive bowel sounds"" and ""elevated lipase and amylase."" I could see the concern in their faces, and it sent chills down my spine. 

Before I knew it, I was being moved to the intensive care unit. I don't remember much from that month—just the constant beeping of machines and the feeling of vulnerability. After they stabilized me, I was transferred to the general medicine floor. They mentioned something about a fluid collection in my abdomen, and I can’t help but feel anxious about what it all means.

When I arrived, I was so anxious. My blood pressure was alarmingly low at 90/59 mm Hg, and I could barely catch my breath. They decided to give me a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells. I hoped this would help, but just 5-10 minutes into the transfusion, everything spiraled. I started feeling chills, and a sharp pain shot through my lower back. To make matters worse, I noticed I wasn’t urinating as much as I should.

I can’t even describe how alarming that was.

Lately, these symptoms have intensified, and I’ve lost quite a bit of weight without even trying. It’s as if my body is failing me. I've been managing systemic lupus erythematosus for years, but it feels like everything is spiraling out of control. I remember going to my doctor, and I could barely sit still because of the pain.

It’s especially bad in the mornings, making each day feel like a struggle.

I’ve had my fair share of visits to the doctor over the years because of recurring bronchitis, and it feels like I’ve tried every antibiotic out there. I’ve never smoked, so I can’t understand why this keeps happening to me. 

During the examination, they checked my blood pressure and heart rate, but those numbers didn’t seem alarming. Yet, when they listened to my chest, I could hear the crackles and wheezing—especially in my right middle lobe. That sound has haunted me ever since.

Now, as I sit here, my heart races at 100 beats per minute, and I can hardly focus on anything else.

They’ve started treatment with a nebulizer, and while I’m hoping it helps, I can’t ignore the knot in my stomach. The oxygen mask feels heavy on my face, but I need it.

I thought I was managing okay, only taking aspirin for my occasional knee pain, and I don’t smoke or drink, so I try to stay healthy. But during my recent check-up, the doctor seemed concerned when they looked at me. My conjunctivae were pale, and they found some petechiae on my legs and even in my mouth. That was alarming. 

To make matters worse, they noted that I have swollen lymph nodes in my neck. I could hardly focus on what the doctor was saying after that.

He didn’t lose consciousness, but he felt this strange chill down his spine right before it happened. 

Afterward, he was so weak he couldn’t lift his arm above his head for two whole hours. It breaks my heart to see him like this. Just three weeks ago, he had a sore throat, which we managed with some over-the-counter meds, and that seemed to resolve. 

It’s been a tough year for us since his dad passed away in a car accident, and now I’m terrified that this could be something serious.

I’ve had no major health issues in the past, just an appendectomy eight years ago, and I’m not on any medications.

I’ve had my share of struggles, especially with alcohol, and the thought of being back in the hospital was terrifying. I felt disheveled and lost, unable to grasp even the simplest things like where I was or what time it was. I could see the concern in the officers' eyes, and I felt embarrassed and anxious. 

During the examination, I noticed how hard it was to keep my balance. I felt like I was stumbling through life, and the nystagmus made everything worse. They ran an MRI, and I was scared about what they might find. When the doctor told me there was damage to my brain, particularly the mammillary bodies, I could hardly process it.

My parents rushed me to the emergency department, and I could see the worry on their faces. I was pale and in so much distress; I could barely breathe.

I didn’t think it was that serious, so I just took some ibuprofen for the pain and tried to push through.

I rushed to the emergency room, but my mind was racing with fear. They told me his heart rate was only 60 beats per minute, and his blood pressure was dangerously low at 70 over 40. I could barely process what they were saying. They tried everything to save him, but despite their efforts, he didn’t make it. 

I was devastated. It felt unreal. Then, I learned they performed an autopsy and found multiple internal hemorrhages and signs of damage to his lungs, kidneys, and brain. The doctors mentioned something about acute hypovolemia possibly causing those issues, but what haunted me the most was the mention of a gross anomaly in his heart.

That was alarming enough, but what really scared me was the weakness on my right side. My arm and leg felt heavy and unresponsive. 

I could tell my wife was worried, and honestly, I was too. The doctors kept asking about my symptoms, and I felt helpless trying to explain what was happening.

Still, I couldn’t shake the unease in my gut. They listened to her lungs and checked her heart, and thankfully, everything sounded clear.

It’s not the first time I've faced something like this; I’ve been hospitalized multiple times before for similar issues. When I arrived at the emergency department, I felt so anxious. My temperature was normal, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was really wrong. The doctors noted dark patches on my skin, which made me even more concerned. 

Looking back, I can’t help but worry about my blood test results from last month. My blood sugar levels were high, and my cholesterol numbers were alarming too.

We rushed to the emergency room, and I could hardly breathe as I watched the doctors examine him. They asked me questions that made my heart race—he’s always bruised easily, and I remembered how my brother died from blood loss after a routine surgery. 

The doctors found bruises on his arms, legs, and even his abdomen, all in different stages of healing. I felt a lump in my throat as they examined his knee, which was swollen, tender, and so painful for him. When they did the arthrocentesis, the bloody aspirate was alarming. They mentioned some laboratory results that just made everything worse; his bleeding time was slightly longer than normal, and the aPTT was quite elevated.

I couldn’t help but think about what this could mean. What if there’s something seriously wrong with his blood? I’m terrified about what could be causing this swelling in his knee.

It’s gotten so bad that I can’t even brush my hair anymore, and I’ve had to stop going to my tennis lessons, which I loved.

What really worries me is that I can’t recall any specific fall or injury that would explain this. When I try to lift my arm, there’s a sharp pain that hits when I raise it between 60 and 120 degrees. It’s terrifying to realize that I can’t even hold my arm up when I lower it slowly from a certain angle—it just drops.

I’ve also been seeing flashes of light intermittently, which is both confusing and frightening. 

Two weeks ago, I had cataract surgery on that same eye, and now this happens? I don’t have any pain or double vision, but I can’t help but feel anxious. I’ve managed my hypertension and type 2 diabetes for years, but my sister’s history with open-angle glaucoma keeps nagging at me. 

I went to the emergency department, hoping to get some answers. They checked my vision and found that I could only count fingers at three feet with my left eye, while my right eye was fine.

They rushed me to the emergency room, and I could hear the doctors talking as they tried to assess what was wrong. I felt so helpless. My temperature was normal, but they said my oxygen levels were dangerously low, and I was turning blue. The doctors tried everything; they even put a tube down my throat and tried to help me breathe, but nothing seemed to work. I could hear the worry in my parents' voices, and it made my heart race with fear.

They reviewed my dental records and mentioned something about the anesthetic that was used—pilocarpine. I can’t help but wonder if that had anything to do with my condition.

Suddenly, I found myself yelling for help. I could hear the wallpaper in the room threatening my family, and it terrified me.

At first, I thought it was just hunger pangs, but then the nausea hit me hard. I was running to the bathroom, and before I knew it, I was vomiting and had diarrhea—everything just came out. I felt so weak and dizzy, and I was really scared. My heart started racing, and I could feel it pounding in my chest.

I had to make the decision to go to the emergency room. When I got there around 4 AM, I was just praying it wasn’t something serious.

The pain always seems to go away when I sit down and rest, but that doesn’t make it any less concerning. I went to see my primary care physician, who checked my vital signs.

I had an ECG done, and thankfully, it looked the same as the last one, but I still can’t shake the feeling that something is off.

I can’t help but notice the swelling around my eyes and my ankles—it’s so uncomfortable. My heart feels like it’s racing, and my blood pressure is through the roof. I can hardly catch my breath, and there are these crackling sounds in my chest when I breathe.

Just five days old, and I had to take him to the emergency room late at night. It all started when I noticed he had green vomit, which really freaked me out. His belly looked bigger than usual, almost swollen, and I couldn’t help but feel a knot tightening in my stomach.

He had been feeding well until that morning, but after a feeding, he suddenly vomited and then continued to do so throughout the day. I tried to stay calm, but I couldn't help but worry when I thought about how he hadn’t passed stool for two days after he was born. In those first few days, everything seemed fine, but now it felt like everything was spiraling out of control.

I remember the doctor examining him and noting his distended abdomen, but there were no palpable masses, which was a slight relief.

I thought we were just going for a quick appointment, but the doctor’s demeanor changed when they examined her. 

I noticed she looked so pale, and there were these strange little spots on her chest, neck, and back—petechiae, they called them. Then, when they checked her abdomen, they mentioned something about painless hepatosplenomegaly. I didn’t even know what that meant, but it didn’t sound good. My heart sank when they talked about her liver enzymes being elevated and her blood count showing slight anemia and a low platelet count. 

The doctor mentioned normal levels for iron, B12, and folate, but then they talked about a bone marrow biopsy. I felt a wave of panic wash over me as they explained that it showed mildly hypocellular marrow with these oddly wrinkled-looking macrophages.

My history of multiple abdominal surgeries, including that stenting of the pancreatic duct, has left me feeling fragile.

The doctors have me on several medications, but nothing seems to help. My blood pressure dropped to alarming levels, and I can barely keep my eyes open. I remember waking up in a haze, surrounded by medical staff, and they were all looking so concerned. I noticed bruises appearing all over me, and the bleeding from my IV sites was horrifying. 

The swelling and redness in my leg caught my attention, and I felt a wave of panic. Why is this happening?

I can barely remember what happened, but it felt like an eternity, even though it was only about 30 seconds. When I woke up, I couldn't even answer simple questions, which really scared me. Thankfully, I regained my orientation after a while, but the fear lingered.

I’ve dealt with hypertension and high cholesterol for years, taking metoprolol and atorvastatin, but this incident felt different. My heart raced as I went through the emergency department checks; they monitored my temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, but everything seemed stable. I could still move my arms and legs without any issues, but the twitching experience left me shaken. 

They did a head CT, and then an MRI, which showed a mass in my brain. I can’t help but worry about what it means.

Each breath feels like a struggle, and it only gets worse when I try to take a deep breath. The only position that brings any relief is leaning forward, which is just so strange.

I was scared when I noticed my heart rate was low, and I can’t help but worry about what that means. The doctors were checking everything, and they heard some kind of friction rub when they listened to my heart. It all feels so overwhelming.

But then, during the exam, my doctor noticed some bruises around my neck and what looked like burn marks on my back and thighs. 

My heart raced as I explained. I never meant for it to come across as anything alarming. These marks—those were just part of my sexual experiences. I’ve realized that to feel aroused, I have to engage in some pretty intense stuff, like hitting or choking. I tried to brush it off, but I could see the concern in my doctor’s eyes. 

I live with my boyfriend, and we’re committed to each other. We’re monogamous, and I thought our relationship was healthy.

My urine was dark, almost like tea, which only added to my anxiety. I’ve been feeling so tired and short of breath, even just walking around my house. 

I finally found myself in the emergency department, where the doctors seemed really concerned. They asked about my drinking habits, and I had to admit that I’ve been a chronic drinker for years now. I was diagnosed with cirrhosis two years ago, and I was told to stop drinking, but I didn’t listen. Now, my abdomen is distended, and I could see the veins on my skin. The pain on the right side was troubling, and I could barely breathe without feeling like I was suffocating. 

After a few days in the hospital, I started to notice that I was urinating less, and my head felt foggy. I felt like things were spiraling out of control.

For the past month, I've noticed his cries have been weak, and it breaks my heart.

He was born a little early, at 37 weeks, and now, at this age, he’s barely hitting the 20th percentile for height and the 15th for weight. I can’t help but feel anxious.

I’m 31 weeks pregnant, and I’ve been trying to take care of myself, especially after having preeclampsia in my last pregnancy.

Then, I got really confused and couldn’t think straight. When I got to the emergency department, I was exhausted, and they took my temperature—it was 100°F.

They even noticed a tremor in my hands when I tried to hold them out.

I remember sitting there, trying to breathe through the pain while the doctors assessed my condition. I felt a mix of fear and confusion as they examined me.

It felt like I was drowning, and to make things worse, I couldn’t seem to think straight. I’ve never had serious health issues before, so this was all so sudden and terrifying. 

I remember the doctors trying to talk to me, but I just couldn't respond. I felt completely lost, like I was in a fog. My heart was racing, and I could hear the monitor beeping wildly. I could see the worried looks on the nurses' faces, and that only made my anxiety worse. 

They said my blood pressure was high, my pulse was racing at 120, and I was breathing fast—36 breaths per minute. I felt cold and clammy, and when they checked my oxygen levels, I learned I was only getting about 90% saturation on a high level of oxygen. 

Then they examined my chest and neck and noted these strange purple spots. I could hear crackles in my lungs, which sounded ominous. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very wrong.

This isn’t the first time this has happened; I’ve had two similar episodes in the past year, but I always brushed them off. I've been dealing with anxiety, and I take alprazolam when I need it, but I never thought it would lead to something like this. I smoke about half a pack of cigarettes daily and enjoy my two glasses of wine with dinner, but now I’m starting to wonder if that’s taking a toll on my health.

When I got to the hospital, my vitals were stable, but I couldn’t shake this feeling of dread.

I can’t recall how long I was there, but I later learned an ambulance was called, and I was brought to the emergency department.

When I woke up, I was pale and felt so weak. I remember the panic in the air as the medical team rushed around me. They were applying pressure to my wrists, and I could hear them talking about my blood pressure and pulse—it all felt surreal. I couldn’t fully grasp what was happening, but I felt terrified. 

When I started to regain consciousness, I was confused and scared. They mentioned something about my Glasgow Coma Scale, and I could feel the weight of my situation.

I’ve always been a heavy drinker and a smoker, but I didn’t think it would catch up with me like this. When I got to the hospital, my abdomen was so tender that even the slightest touch felt unbearable. The doctors said they couldn’t hear any bowel sounds, which made my heart race even more. I could feel something was terribly wrong. 

Even after all the tests, including the X-ray, nothing showed up. I thought maybe there was hope, but then my condition just seemed to spiral downward.

I remember her being born healthy and reaching her milestones fine, so this sudden change is incredibly alarming. She’s always been small for her age—40th percentile for height and 20th for weight—but this feels different. When we went to the doctor, they took her temperature, and it was 38.1°C. They also noted her pulse was quite high at 128. 

During the examination, the doctor felt an irregular mass in her abdomen that crosses the midline, and they found her liver was enlarged.

At 75 years old, I know my body isn’t what it used to be, especially since I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 30 years ago. I’ve been managing it with metformin, but my last check-up revealed my HbA1C was at 10%. That really scared me. I never thought I’d let my diabetes get so out of control, and now I’m terrified of what that might mean for my health.

When I went to the doctor, they checked my vital signs, and everything seemed normal, but I just can’t help feeling that something is seriously wrong.

I can barely remember anything from that day, but I know I was feeling off.

When I finally came to, I was in the emergency department. The doctors were all around me, and I felt so lost. I couldn’t respond to them, just opening my eyes to pain. It terrified me to realize that I wasn’t able to speak or even move properly. They said my heart sounded normal, but I could hear them mention a 4th heart sound, which made my stomach drop.

I've never had any major health issues before, so this was all so unexpected. My mom mentioned that my uncle had similar problems when he had his wisdom teeth taken out and that he also has a history of easy bruising.

They told me my breathing rate was alarmingly high, and my heart was racing. I felt like I was falling apart. The chest examination revealed wheezing, and I could hear it myself. 

As I sat there, waiting for answers, I couldn’t help but worry. I’ve never had heart issues, and the thought of something being seriously wrong was overwhelming. They mentioned something about my heart having an abnormal rhythm and my left ventricle being dilated, which made my heart sink even further.

My mom has always struggled with anxiety, and I’ve dealt with my own issues, like major depressive disorder, but this felt different.

When the ambulance came, I couldn’t even respond to their questions. I was sweating profusely, and I could feel my body was out of control – my pulse was racing, and I could barely breathe. They told me I wasn’t oriented, and I remember feeling so cold, like my feet were frozen. 

The worst part was when I started screaming and tried to bite the doctor. I felt like I was losing my mind.

Panic set in, and I rushed him to the pediatric emergency room. I felt so helpless. The doctors ran tests, and I could see the concern in their faces. They talked about doing an endoscopic biopsy of his colon, and I felt a knot in my stomach. What could be wrong with my baby? They mentioned something about the absence of Meissner’s and Auerbach’s plexi in his bowel wall, but I could barely process it. All I wanted was for him to be okay.

I’ve always been healthy, and I’m not on any medications, so this is all so unexpected. I try to breathe through it, but the pain just keeps worsening. When the doctor examines me, I can feel the pressure build as they check the areas around my jaw and temples. It hurts so much when I open and close my mouth; I can hardly stand it. 

I’m terrified that something is seriously wrong. The thought of what could be causing this headache keeps racing through my mind, and I just want some answers.

My last menstrual period was just two weeks ago, so I figured everything was fine.

During the exam, the doctor said everything looked normal, which gave me some relief. But then, she mentioned the Pap smear results. I can’t shake the feeling of dread that something might be wrong. I don’t have any unusual vaginal discharge, and I haven’t experienced any burning or itching, but now I can’t help but worry about what those results mean.

During my recent annual physical, I mentioned how I’ve been struggling. The doctor took some tests, and that’s when I learned my renal function has worsened since my last visit two years ago. I can’t help but feel anxious thinking about those numbers. A serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL? That’s alarming, right? 

The doctor also mentioned something about protein in my urine, which I suppose is another red flag. I never imagined my kidneys would become part of this nightmare. They did a renal biopsy, and now I’m left worrying about eosinophilic infiltration and inflammation. What does all this mean for me?

The doctors admitted me, and I could sense they were concerned too. My heart was racing—my pulse was at 122 beats per minute. They took my temperature, and it was 101.5°F. I didn’t know if this was normal or if something was wrong. They examined my abdomen and found severe tenderness in my lower quadrants, which only heightened my anxiety.

When they did the speculum exam, I learned that my membranes had ruptured, and the fluid was not just clear but also malodorous and blood-tinged. I worried for my baby.

At first, they were just these red bumps that didn’t itch at all, but then they grew larger, turning into painful ulcers that crusted over. 

I’ve been trying to keep my mind off it, but it’s hard not to worry. I haven’t had any fever or stomach pain, but the sight of these lesions is unsettling. I’ve been with my partner since we got married at 24, and I can’t help but feel anxious about what this could mean. 

When I finally went to see a doctor, they examined the sores and took a biopsy, which only added to my unease.

She kept complaining about the pain, and I noticed that even though she could move her eyes, it didn’t make the pain worse, which was a small relief, I suppose.

But when I examined it more closely, my heart sank. The swelling was soft and felt warm to the touch. I could see that it was affecting the upper part of her eyelid, even involving the hair follicles, which made me panic a little more. I couldn’t help but think it might be something serious. 

And then, to top it all off, when I gently pressed on the lump, it drained some pus. I felt completely helpless and overwhelmed.

So, I finally decided to talk to my family doctor about it. My dad came with me for support, which I really appreciated because I was feeling pretty anxious. He even mentioned that he’s had similar issues from time to time, but it didn’t really help ease my mind. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something might be seriously wrong. 

Sitting in that doctor's office, I kept wondering what it could be. I mean, red urine? That can’t be normal, right? I just want to find out what’s going on and if I need to worry about it.

At first, the chest pain I had before the surgery disappeared, which gave me some relief. But now, out of nowhere, I’m feeling that pain again. 

It's so unsettling. The pain seems to get worse when I take deep breaths, and the only position that offers me any comfort is leaning forward. Lying flat is unbearable, and I can’t help but feel anxious about what this could mean. I’ve been managing my diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol for years, but this is different. 

When the doctors checked me, they said my vital signs were normal and there were no murmurs when they listened to my heart.

The day before, I had felt this strange weakness; my left wrist just wouldn’t cooperate, and it felt like I was losing control of my own body. I’ve been so stressed lately, and I couldn’t help but worry that something serious was happening. I’ve only ever had issues with acid reflux before, but now this? The doctors examined me, and while they said my muscle strength was fine, I felt utterly indifferent to everything around me. It’s like I was in a fog.

When I got to the doctor, my blood pressure was incredibly low, and I felt so weak. They said my heart wasn’t pumping well, and I couldn’t understand why this was happening to me.

The doctor mentioned something about my lungs sounding concerning during the exam, and I could hear the crackling noise when they listened. They admitted me to the hospital right away and started me on medication to help with the fluid in my body. I felt so overwhelmed when they told me my kidney numbers weren’t looking good either. I couldn’t help but worry about what this meant for my health.

When I finally decided to see a doctor, they found tenderness in my left gluteal area. I thought maybe they’d just recommend some rest, but then they did an x-ray.

Just a few weeks ago, I had an upper respiratory infection that I thought was under control after taking antibiotics. But I’ve had this persistent cough for years, ever since I had that stroke three years ago. I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes every day for 40 years, but I quit after my stroke. Was that enough?

As I looked at him, I noticed he just looked so tired and uncomfortable. I felt a knot in my stomach when I saw he was tender over his forehead and cheeks. I could tell something wasn’t right. His lymph nodes felt swollen, and I just kept thinking, “What could this be?”

I’ve had episodes of chest pain before, but they were nothing like this—usually brief and not intense at all. I’m diabetic and have been managing hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis for years, but I never expected this. I was gasping for breath and sweating profusely when the ambulance arrived. 

When I got to the emergency department, I could barely focus on what was happening. The doctors were talking about my heart, and I heard them mention Q waves and ST segments. They started me on medications, and for a moment, I thought I was improving. But then, on the sixth day of my hospitalization, I started vomiting and feeling dizzy.

It started out as a nagging ache, but it has escalated to something I can’t ignore. What’s worse is this relentless fatigue that’s been dragging me down for months. I’ve noticed my clothes fitting looser—turns out I’ve lost about 20 pounds without even trying. The more I think about it, the more I worry.

When I went to see my doctor, he mentioned that my creatinine levels had increased from what they used to be. I didn’t quite understand what that meant, but it sounded serious. He also mentioned something about my calcium levels being high, which only added to my anxiety. I felt like I was spiraling deeper into worry.

Now, I’ve been referred to a nephrologist, and I can’t help but feel scared about what they might find. The thought of needing a kidney biopsy is weighing heavily on my mind. I just want answers.

When the doctors checked my vitals, I heard them mention my low oxygen levels—73%—and I couldn’t help but panic. 

I remember the chaos as they prepared to intubate me. I was terrified, and the thought of being in the intensive care unit was overwhelming. After the surgery, I thought things would get better, but then I started having episodes of apnea again while I was sleeping. It felt like I was fighting a losing battle. 

I can't stop worrying about what’s happening to me. Why am I still having these episodes?

I’ve been managing schizophrenia for the past 25 years with chlorpromazine, and while it’s been under control, I can’t help but wonder if my medication is somehow affecting my eyesight. My mind races with questions every time I look in the mirror or try to read something. 

I finally decided to visit my primary care doctor, hoping to find some answers. As I sat in the waiting room, my heart pounded with anxiety. What if this is something serious?

Last week, she had a common cold, but that seemed to pass without any issues. Now, with her temperature hitting 101.6°F, I can’t help but feel like something is really wrong.

When I went to see the doctor, I felt a mix of hope and anxiety. They examined my knee, and I could see the doctor’s brow furrow. There’s some mild swelling, and it hurts when they touch the front part of my tibia. Even trying to extend my knee against resistance made it hurt more, and I realized I couldn’t bend it properly either. It’s so frustrating! There’s no redness or swelling that I can see, but something just doesn’t feel right.

I keep thinking about what could be causing this pain, and I’m scared it might affect my chances at tryouts. I just want to get back to playing without this worry hanging over me.

When the paramedics arrived, I could barely explain how I was feeling, but I told them everything—my history of hypertension, those awful urinary tract infections that just wouldn’t go away, my mitral valve prolapse, and even the diverticulosis I’ve been managing. They rushed me to the emergency room, and I was terrified. I felt so vulnerable. 

Once there, I was examined, and thankfully, they said there were no major neurological issues. But they noticed how stiff my neck was and that bright lights hurt my eyes.

I remember sitting there, shivering and struggling to breathe. They told me I was hypoxemic, which made my heart race even more. I had been on immunosuppressants since the transplant, but I had stopped taking my antifungal medication, voriconazole, for reasons I still can’t fully understand. The doctors took some imaging and found these strange pulmonary nodules in my lungs. That’s when they decided to do a biopsy.

She’s from Lebanon, and it seems like ever since we’ve been here, she’s been sick more often than not. Every few months, she ends up on antibiotics for the same issues, and it terrifies me to think about what’s going on inside her. She has seasonal allergies, and I can’t help but wonder if that’s making everything worse. 

When we arrived, the doctors took her temperature, and it was 101°F. I could feel my heart racing as they checked her other vitals. Despite everything, she seemed okay, but those coarse breath sounds during the exam really worried me. They decided to do a chest x-ray, and I just sat there, thinking about what they might find.

I’m 39 weeks pregnant, and with my history, I can't help but worry. My previous pregnancies had their challenges, including a scary episode of chorioamnionitis that thankfully resolved, but this feels different. I’ve been smoking, which I hate to admit, and I can’t help but think it’s making everything worse. 

When I got to the hospital, I was so anxious about what they would find. My blood pressure was low, and my heart was racing.

I lift weights regularly and I don’t smoke, so this just doesn’t seem right.

When I arrived, they took my vitals—my temperature was normal, and my blood pressure was fine, but I could feel my heart racing. The doctor listened to my heart and mentioned something about a murmur, which really struck me with fear. I didn’t know what that meant, but the way he talked about it made me worry.

I’ve never had any serious health issues before, and I don’t smoke or drink. I’ve always tried to take care of myself, but now I’m really worried.

The doctors admitted him for observation, and I felt a wave of helplessness wash over me. I kept thinking about what could be wrong. It was hard to focus on anything else.

I ended up in the emergency department, terrified about what was happening to my body.

Once there, they quickly hooked me up to machines and ran tests. I remember feeling a flicker of hope when they started treating me immediately.

In addition to this breathing issue, I’ve been dealing with high blood pressure and rheumatoid arthritis, but I’ve never been one to rely on medications.

Things took a turn at my routine visit when my blood pressure spiked to 176/103. I remember feeling that severe headache creeping in, and my heart sank when the doctor sent me to the triage unit. Despite several attempts to lower my blood pressure, I ended up needing a C-section. I was so scared, but the fetal heart monitor showed reassuring signs, and I held on to that hope.

When my baby boy was born, he weighed a hefty 9 pounds 6 ounces. But shortly after, I noticed something was off. He felt jittery, and his temperature was low. The moment he struggled to latch during his first feeding, my heart dropped. It was terrifying to see him shaking and then suddenly become lethargic. I can’t shake the worry from my mind—what could be causing all of this? I just want my baby to be okay.",A. Transplacental action of maternal insulin B. ß-cell hyperplasia C. Neonatal sepsis D.

399,"I can’t shake this feeling of dread as I sit in the emergency department. It all started yesterday with just a fever and a headache, something I thought I could manage with acetaminophen. But things took a turn for the worse, and now I’m battling blurry vision, chills, nausea, and vomiting. My body feels like it’s on fire with a temperature of 104°F. 

I’ve been managing diabetes and hypertension for a while, taking insulin and metformin, along with lisinopril. I thought I was in control, but now everything feels so overwhelming. My heart races at 120 beats per minute, and even though my oxygen levels are fine, I can’t help but feel like something is seriously wrong. 

The doctors are examining me closely. They’ve noticed that my eye looks different, bulging out in a way that’s frightening. I can’t move it properly, and there’s a strange numbness around it that worries me more than I can express. 

As I wait for a CT scan, I feel my energy slipping away. I’m becoming lethargic, and I can sense that something is changing in me. I just keep thinking about what this could mean, and I’m terrified of the unknown. What if this is something serious? I can’t help but feel that I’m in the midst of a medical nightmare.",A.
