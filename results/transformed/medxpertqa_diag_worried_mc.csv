0,"I can’t shake off this sharp pain that’s been gripping my right groin for the past two weeks. It’s relentless, and I find some relief only when I stand up, which is a small comfort. I went to the doctor, but honestly, I’m still worried. My blood pressure was measured at 140/92, and my heart rate was 88, which seemed a bit high for me. They listened to my heart and checked my abdomen, lungs, and other areas, but everything seemed unremarkable; no hernias, nothing alarming.

Still, something feels wrong. The doctor did some tests and found tenderness in my lower back, specifically at L4 and L5. The right side of my sacrum looks off too, and the seated flexion test confirmed something was amiss. They took some images of my hip and lower back, and thankfully, there were no obvious issues. But I can’t help but worry about what could be causing this pain. 

I’m left wondering which structure is responsible for this discomfort. Is it a ligament or a muscle? I feel like I’m just in the dark, and the uncertainty is making me anxious. I really hope I can find answers soon because living with this pain is exhausting.",A. Sacrotuberous ligament B. Quadratus lumborum muscle C. Piriformis muscle D. Posterior sacroiliac ligament E.

1,"I can hardly shake off the anxiety that has settled in since my baby was born. Just moments after the cesarean delivery at 38 weeks, the nurses noticed that my newborn was breathing rapidly—tachypnea, they called it—with a respiratory rate of 90 breaths per minute. They mentioned something about retractions, which sounded alarming. I kept staring at my little one, who seemed so active and alert, yet my heart raced with worry. Thankfully, there was no cyanosis, but I felt so helpless watching my baby being whisked away for observation in intensive care.

The doctors reassured me that there were no signs of fever or rash, and the blood gas analysis showed no CO2 retention. Still, I couldn’t shake the fear that something might be seriously wrong. I kept asking myself what exactly was happening. Was this just a benign condition, or was it something more serious? I heard them discussing different management approaches—everything from antibiotics to surfactant therapy—and I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed. 

I just want to know, is this normal? Will my baby be okay? I keep praying for the doctors to figure it out soon, but the uncertainty is weighing heavily on me.","A. Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation is the first-line management B. The condition is benign and self-limiting, requiring no specific treatment C. This is hard to distinguish from pneumonia and sepsis so empirical antibiotics are given for 48 hours after birth until sepsis is ruled out D. Surfactant deficiency is the underlying cause, so surfactant therapy is required E. This is most likely transient tachypnea of the newborn and requires no antibiotics F. Tachypnea in this case is likely due to a congenital heart defect, so echocardiography is indicated G. ABG is needed to monitor  and it is normal to have CO2 retention H. A chest X-ray must be done immediately to confirm the diagnosis of neonatal pneumonia I. Empirical antifungal therapy should be initiated until fungal sepsis is ruled out J.

2,"Over the past year, I've been on an emotional rollercoaster as my child and several other kids were evaluated by a pediatric cardiac surgeon for similar congenital heart defects. I remember the day so clearly when I first heard the loud holosystolic murmur over my child's chest. It was terrifying to think that something could be so wrong. The doctors assured us that their vital signs were stable and that they were on appropriate medications, but I couldn’t shake the worry.

They performed echocardiograms on each child, and I held my breath as we waited for the results. I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me when I learned that one of the children would need surgical closure of the defect. The thought of surgery sent me into a spiral of fear. I kept wondering which child it would be and what that meant for their future.

I couldn't help but compare my child to the other patients. Would they need surgery too? There was a 5-year-old boy with a 3-mm muscular defect, an 18-month-old with a 6-mm defect, and so many others with varying degrees of severity. It felt overwhelming.

3,"I can’t shake this feeling of dread. It all started five days ago when I came down with a fever and chills that just wouldn’t quit. My head was pounding, and I felt this terrible pain in my back that made it hard to even move. I knew something wasn’t right, so I went to the hospital. 

When I got there, the doctor took my temperature, and it was a bit over 100 degrees. My blood pressure was low, and I remember feeling so thin and sweaty. They noticed my pupils were tiny, and I felt embarrassed about my teeth and the track marks on my arms and legs. I just couldn’t help but worry about what all this could mean.

They admitted me and started me on antibiotics right away. But then, a few hours later, I heard them say something about my blood cultures coming back positive for Staphylococcus aureus. That word “Staphylococcus” kept echoing in my mind, and I felt my heart race. What was next? I could hardly breathe thinking about it. I just want to know if there’s something more going on, something worse. I’m terrified of what might happen if they don’t act quickly.

4,"I can’t shake this feeling of worry as I sit in the waiting room for my routine prenatal visit. I’m 27 weeks pregnant with my first child, and while most of my pregnancy has gone well, I’ve started experiencing this overwhelming fatigue and some mild swelling in my legs. It’s unsettling, especially since my sister had preeclampsia during her pregnancy.

As I finally enter the exam room, I can’t help but feel anxious. I’ve been managing my epilepsy with lamotrigine, and I have no history of tobacco or alcohol use, but I just can’t shake off this nagging concern. The nurse takes my temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and everything seems normal, but those tiny signs of swelling in my ankles make me uneasy.

I know I should be feeling joyful about this pregnancy, but instead, I keep thinking about what might happen next. What if something is wrong? I’ve heard about the risks associated with preeclampsia, and my mind races with possibilities. I just want reassurance. The doctor comes in, and I can see the concern in their eyes too.

5,"I can’t shake this feeling of dread since my baby boy was born at just 34 weeks. Everything seemed fine during my pregnancy, but there were signs—like the polyhydramnios. When he arrived, I was filled with joy, but it quickly turned to worry as I learned that he was struggling to breathe in the NICU. His Apgar scores were 6 and 8, which I know isn’t terrible, but seeing him with those excessive secretions and moments where his oxygen levels dipped made my heart race. 

He’s only a newborn, and it’s terrifying to witness him in respiratory distress, with those intercostal retractions and unusual sounds when the doctors listened to his lungs. They mentioned his temperature was a bit high and that his belly looked distended, which only added to my fears. 

I can’t help but feel overwhelmed when they talk about the possibility of serious conditions like esophageal atresia or other issues that could be affecting him. I’ve been trying to keep it together, but the thought of what he might be facing keeps me up at night. I just want him to be okay and to come home with me. The uncertainty is so hard to bear.

6,"I can't shake the worry that has settled in my chest. Just last night, my 5-year-old son started complaining about a sore throat. At first, I thought it was nothing serious, but it quickly escalated. By the time morning came, he was struggling to breathe, and I could see he was in distress. His temperature shot up to 103°F, and he was drooling, which made my heart race even faster. 

When we got to the emergency department, he seemed so ill, leaning forward to breathe as if that would somehow help. He wouldn’t even talk to me or let the doctors examine his mouth. I felt so helpless watching him like that. He’s usually such a vibrant, healthy kid, always up to date on his vaccinations and taking his multivitamins. 

I could see the concern in the doctors’ eyes as they rushed around him. His pulse was racing at 155 beats per minute, and his breathing was rapid too. I couldn't help but think, what could be causing this? I was terrified, wondering if it was something serious. I just want to know what's wrong and make it better for him.

7,"I can hardly shake this feeling of anxiety since my last appointment. It’s been two months since I had that surgery to remove the craniopharyngioma, and while I’ve been trying to stay positive, something just doesn’t feel right. I thought I was doing okay, but I keep getting these intermittent fevers that spike up to 39°C. It’s unnerving, to say the least. 

I also noticed that my appetite has increased, which is strange. I’ve been taking my medications—Levothyroxine, hydrocortisone, desmopressin, and my testosterone injections—so I thought everything was under control. But when I went for my follow-up, my temperature was still high at 38.8°C. My heart raced a bit, and I can’t help but worry about what this could mean.

The doctors did a thorough check and said my craniotomy scar looks fine, but I can’t shake this fear of something being wrong. They ran a bunch of tests—blood cultures, a urinalysis, even an MRI of my head. Everything seemed unremarkable, but I still can’t help but feel anxious about the possibility of an infection or something else lurking. I just want to know what’s causing these fevers.

8,"I can’t shake this feeling of worry that’s been creeping in over the last four months. It all started with a low-grade fever and this constant sense of malaise that just won’t go away. I’ve lost about 20 pounds, which is alarming, and I’m so fatigued that even simple tasks feel monumental. 

I remember feeling a bit off when I had my mitral valve replacement five years ago, but this is different. I went to see the doctor, and they checked my temperature—it was 38.1°C (100.6°F). My heart rate was elevated, and I could barely catch my breath. During the exam, the doctor mentioned hearing a new murmur in my heart, which really shook me. 

I can’t help but wonder if something serious is happening. Why am I feeling this way? Is there an infection lurking inside me? With my history, I’m terrified of what could be causing these symptoms.

9,"I can hardly believe what happened to me. It all started about a week ago when I began feeling weak and unwell, almost like I was running a fever. I’ve had my fair share of health issues, including hepatitis C and cirrhosis, but this felt different. When I went to the emergency room, my temperature was 102°F, and I was terrified. My blood pressure was high, and my pulse was racing. I remember lying there, feeling utterly drained and noticing the jaundice spreading over my skin.

The doctors examined me and mentioned something about fluid in my abdomen and tenderness, which only made me more anxious. They admitted me and started me on antibiotics. I thought maybe this was it, maybe I was finally getting better. But four days later, I was still feeling the effects of the jaundice, and I noticed strange bruises all over my arms and legs. The nurses were concerned too; they had to apply pressure to two IV sites because I was bleeding.

10,"I can't shake this feeling of dread. At 59, I thought I was in pretty good health, but lately, everything feels off. I’ve been so tired, like I can't get enough rest, and it’s worrying me. I've also lost weight without trying, and there’s this awful abdominal pain that just won’t go away. I can’t remember the last time I felt normal.

My medical history isn’t too bad, but I do deal with anxiety and diabetes. I had a foot fracture recently, which was a painful reminder of my age, and I caught a cold that knocked me out for a week. Now, on top of everything else, my blood pressure is high, and I found out I have a mild heart murmur. I try not to think about it, but it’s hard.

I’ve been taking my medications like metformin and insulin, but nothing seems to help. I went to my doctor, and they ran tests—my white blood cell count was alarmingly high. I just can’t help but worry about what this all means. I keep thinking about the different possible diagnoses my doctor mentioned. What if it’s something serious? I really don’t want to face that.

11,"I can’t shake off this overwhelming worry since my baby was born just a day ago. He’s a sweet little boy, but he’s been struggling to feed, which I thought was just normal newborn fussiness. Then, I noticed his breathing seemed really fast, and his skin has this alarming bluish-grey tint. It’s like something is really wrong, and I can’t help but feel terrified.

He was born at 37 weeks, and while I thought everything was fine, I didn’t have the best prenatal care. I’ve never used drugs during my pregnancy, so this is just so confusing and frightening. The nurses took his temperature, and it was a normal 98.2, but his blood pressure was low, and his heart was racing at 170 beats per minute. The worst part is when they said he looked lethargic and had this dangerous cyanosis. They mentioned something about jugular venous distention, and all I could think was, “What does this mean for my baby?”

They listened to his chest and said he was breathing too fast, and I could hear this murmur. They even took him for a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram.

12,"I've been feeling really uneasy lately about some changes in my body. I've noticed that certain bones, particularly in my legs, seem to be getting larger, and it’s been weighing heavily on my mind. I keep wondering what could be causing this bone enlargement. I've tried to do some research, but there are so many conditions to consider. 

I came across a list of possible causes, and it made me feel even more anxious. There’s Lytic Paget disease, which sounds serious, and then there’s Osteochondroma, an abnormal bone growth. I read about Osteoid osteoma and Fibrous dysplasia too, and they all seem alarming in their own ways. 

What really troubles me is that I could also be dealing with Melorheostosis or even something like Hyperparathyroidism, which affects calcium levels. The thought of Giant cell tumors or Aneurysmal bone cysts adds to my worry. 

I know I need to see a doctor to get to the bottom of this, but the uncertainty is really getting to me. I just want to understand what’s happening with my body and whether I should be scared.

Over the last couple of years, I've noticed my fingers becoming increasingly painful and stiff, but I kept telling myself it was just getting older. I don’t have any history of serious illness, I don’t take any medications, and I’ve never smoked or drank alcohol, so this all feels so sudden and alarming.

When I went to see the doctor, I could tell something was wrong. I felt moderately distressed, and my heart was racing. They found my blood pressure was really high, and my oxygen levels were low. I noticed the doctor looking concerned when they examined me—my skin was pale, and I had swelling in my legs, which I hadn’t even realized was a problem. There were strange spots on my skin, and my joints felt stiff.

His head circumference had jumped from the 50th percentile to the 90th percentile since his newborn visit. I couldn’t help but feel a knot in my stomach.

As I looked at my little boy, I noticed how his head appeared elongated and narrow, with a prominent occiput and broad forehead. No one wants to think there might be something wrong, but I couldn’t shake the worry. The doctor did say there were no facial dysmorphic features and that the rest of the exam was unremarkable, but still, my mind raced with questions. 

What if there’s something serious going on? I kept thinking about all the possibilities. I wanted to ensure he was okay, so I asked about what we should do next.

At first, I thought it was just a bump, but when I went to the doctor, they ran some tests and everything came back fine. I was relieved but still uneasy because the feeling lingered. 

Weeks later, I went back for another check-up, hoping for answers, but again, nothing abnormal showed up. I remember the doctor examining me closely, checking my reflexes and the nerves in my head, and they said everything looked normal, but I just don’t feel right. They even did some structural tests and mentioned something about the greater wings of my sphenoid being out of place. 

I can’t help but feel anxious about what this all means. It’s frustrating not knowing why I feel this way and if it could lead to something worse.

When I went to see the doctor, my vital signs were normal, and my oxygen levels were decent. But then they did a chest X-ray, and I learned I have a moderate left pleural effusion. That phrase keeps echoing in my mind—what does it mean? The thought of fluid around my lungs is terrifying. 

They did a thoracentesis, and I can’t help but feel uneasy about the results. The fluid they took out was light-green, and I read the analysis: the pH was low, and there were abnormal cell findings. The waiting for more tests is unbearable.

I went to see the doctor, and during the examination, I could feel my heart racing and my breathing was so labored. I overheard them say my oxygen levels were only at 88%, which made me panic a bit. They listened to my lungs and noted that there was something strange going on in the lower part of my left lung. The doctor mentioned a chest CT scan, which revealed a significant pleural effusion on the left side. 

Then came the thoracentesis—1400 mL of bloody fluid was taken out. That was alarming. The doctor said the fluid tests didn’t show any signs of infection or cancer, but I can’t help but worry about what might be causing this.

It was terrifying. She has a complicated heart history, including dextrocardia and a double inlet left ventricle, so I knew we had to get her help right away.

When we arrived at the hospital, her oxygen saturation was only 81%. I could feel my heart racing as they rushed her in for a physical exam. The doctors mentioned her rapid breathing and the tachycardia they observed. They did an ECG, which thankfully showed sinus rhythm, and an echocardiogram that revealed her left ventricular function was normal. But still, why was she turning blue?

I came to this osteopathic clinic hoping for some help, but honestly, I was feeling pretty desperate. The migraines have been relentless, and while I’ve tried several medications, they only provide temporary relief. It’s so frustrating.

During my visit, the doctor examined me and found a strain at the sphenobasilar synchondrosis. I didn’t even know that was a thing! My sacral base is apparently tilted anteriorly. I can’t help but worry about what this all means. I’m anxious that this could lead to more serious issues. The doctor mentioned something about osteopathic manipulative treatment, and now I’m wondering if that’s really going to help or if I’m just grasping at straws.

21,"I can’t shake this feeling of worry since our 4-month-old son’s last checkup. During the routine visit, the doctor seemed concerned about how he’s been so distressed at night. We’ve been trying to wean him off nighttime feedings, but every time 3-4 hours pass without him eating, he becomes inconsolable. It’s heartbreaking to see him so upset. 

The growth assessment was troubling too; he’s slipped from the 25th to the 5th percentile in length, while his weight has stayed at the 25th percentile. I can’t help but notice how different he looks. His face has this fullness that I can’t quite describe, and his abdomen is so distended. His limbs seem so thin, it makes me anxious. 

What really shook me was when the doctor felt his liver—it extends down to his iliac crest, but thank goodness his spleen seems normal. I just feel like something is wrong, especially after they drew blood. The results showed this milky white layer on top, and I can’t stop worrying about what it means for him.

Ever since then, I’ve been careful about what I eat, keeping my levels mostly in check during my childhood.

But now, at school, it’s becoming really tough. The phenylalanine-free formula I have to drink smells so strong, and there’s no way to keep it cold.

I mentioned it to my doctor, along with some other troubling symptoms—joint pain, headaches, frothy urine, and this weird tingling in my fingers and toes. I tried to convince myself that they weren’t connected to the swelling, but deep down, I’m not so sure. 

I have a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension, so I guess I should have expected that something might be off. During the exam, the doctor noted the swelling in my legs was quite pronounced, and they seemed genuinely concerned. The mention of cardiac enlargement in the chest radiograph left me feeling uneasy. And then there’s the urinalysis; the results showed protein in my urine and some concerning casts. 

I keep wondering what all this could mean. The doctor didn’t dive into specifics, but I can’t help but think about what could be causing this edema. The uncertainty is overwhelming.

As I sat there, I noticed that his height was way above the 99th percentile, while his weight was only at the 15th percentile. That didn't sit well with me. The doctor examined him and found some concerning things. He mentioned bilateral inferior lens dislocation, long slender fingers, a high-arched palate, and hyperelastic skin. My heart sank when I saw how his thumb and fifth finger overlapped when he wrapped one hand around the other wrist. 

I felt a wave of worry wash over me. What could all of this mean? I wanted to understand why my son was experiencing these issues.

Today, I noticed my cough was getting worse. I started bringing up this thick yellow phlegm, and I could barely catch my breath.

I’ve struggled with type 2 diabetes for a while now, and my blood sugar levels have been hard to control. My doctor mentioned my pre-pregnancy HbA1c was at 10.1%, which is way above the target. I’m just taking metformin three times a day—what if that’s not enough? 

During the check-up, I learned that my BMI is 35, and my blood pressure is okay, but I can’t shake this anxiety.

60,"I can’t shake the feeling of dread that has settled over me lately. It all started about nine months ago when I began hearing things—voices, whispers, even messages that I thought were from my deceased sister. I remember sitting in our living room, staring at the vase that seemed to hold her spirit. At first, my husband thought I was just joking, but things escalated quickly. 

Last night at dinner with his parents, I don’t even know what came over me. I felt a rush of anger and suddenly I found myself threatening them with a knife. I didn’t mean to, but it felt like I was losing control. My husband had to call the police, and I could see the fear in his eyes. 

Now I’m sitting here, unable to speak, while he explains everything to the psychiatrist. I can’t look anyone in the eye. I’ve been so depressed for the past year, and I can’t sleep at all. I’ve lost weight—twelve pounds in six months—and I feel like I’m a shadow of my former self. I don’t use drugs or alcohol, and the thought of harming myself or anyone else terrifies me.

At 82 years old, I’ve always tried to stay strong, but the past few days have been terrifying. I’ve been feeling lightheaded and weak, and there were moments when I thought I might pass out. Then came the alarming reality of melena—I noticed dark, tarry stools, which sent my anxiety into overdrive.

I have a history of moderate aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease, and I’ve been on several medications: aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. After my symptoms worsened, I was given intravenous fluids and blood products, which helped stabilize me. I’m grateful I didn’t bleed any further, but the thought of what might be going on inside my body is haunting me.

It gets worse during intercourse, and then I noticed some vaginal spotting afterward, which really freaked me out. On top of that, I’ve had some weird intermenstrual bleeding. 

I've been sexually active recently, with three partners in the last month, which makes me even more nervous about what might be going on. At the clinic, they checked my vital signs, and everything seemed normal, but the abdominal examination showed some mild tenderness, which didn’t help ease my worries. 

During the pelvic exam, they found mucopurulent cervical discharge and I felt pain when they moved my cervix, which was really alarming. They did a urine test for pregnancy, and thankfully, it came back negative, but I still feel like something is seriously wrong.

I’ve worked as an aerospace engineer, but I've also spent years in coal mining and sandblasting. I can’t help but worry that my exposure to all those particles is catching up with me.

When the nurse took my vital signs, I tried to stay calm, but I felt my heart racing. They said my oxygen levels were a bit low at 94%, and I couldn’t help but feel a knot tighten in my stomach.

I overheard the word ""pneumoconiosis,"" and my heart sank. What if that’s what I have? I know it’s linked to my past jobs, and I’m terrified of what that means for my health.

When I got to the emergency department, they started checking me out. I was shocked to find out that I had weakness in both my legs, like they just didn't want to cooperate with me. The doctors mentioned I had some kind of sensory loss in my groin, which sounded alarming. To make matters worse, they told me my Achilles reflex was absent, but I still had some reflexes in my knees. That didn’t really comfort me.

But then I start to think about the things she struggles with. She can’t kick a ball, and it’s so concerning that she can’t stack more than two blocks. I’ve noticed she also has a hard time following two-step commands. And when I ask her to identify pictures in a book, she just stares blankly instead of pointing them out.

He was born healthy at term, but now I can't help but think about the three times he’s had ear infections since he was born.

80,"I can’t shake this nagging worry that something is seriously wrong with me. Just the other day, I went to see my primary care provider because I’ve been experiencing this intense burning sensation right behind my breastbone and painful swallowing. I mean, it felt like fire inside my chest! 

At 23, I never thought I’d be dealing with these kinds of issues. I have some health problems, like hypothyroidism and endometriosis, and I’m always exhausted from chronic fatigue syndrome. I take my medications—levothyroxine, doxycycline, and naproxen—every night since I often forget them in the morning. But now, I can’t help but wonder if they’re even helping.

During my appointment, I was nervous about what the doctor would find. My temperature was normal, and my blood pressure was fine, but I just felt off.

I thought the ankle would heal, but then this intense pain crept into my knee. It hurts especially when I try to fully extend it, and no matter how much ibuprofen I take or how many times I ice it, the pain just won’t go away. 

I’ve had my fair share of ankle sprains before, but I’ve never felt anything like this in my knee. When I went to see a doctor, they examined my knee and found tenderness on the outside, and they mentioned something about the fibular head not moving properly. Strangely, my ankle doesn’t hurt at all, which makes me even more anxious. They did some X-rays of my leg, and thankfully, there were no fractures, but I can’t help but feel that something else is going on.

At 65, I never imagined I’d be facing something so daunting, especially with my heavy smoking history. I enrolled in a clinical trial, hoping that the PD-1 inhibitor would give me a fighting chance against this relentless disease.

After several weeks of treatment, I was anxious to see if there had been any improvement. At the eight-week mark, I felt a glimmer of hope when my right lung lesion shrank a bit, and the liver spots looked smaller too. But then, by week 16, I was hit with a wave of anxiety. My right lung lesion had started to grow again, and even though my liver lesion had fluctuated, it wasn’t looking good. The left lung lesion also seemed to be getting worse. 

I keep replaying the numbers in my head, trying to decipher what they mean for my future. Am I experiencing a delayed progression? Or could this be a mixed response? The uncertainty is unbearable.

I’ve also noticed that I’ve lost about 5 kilograms recently, which is worrying me. My face and arms swell up intermittently, and it seems to get worse when I lie down. 

To top it all off, I’ve been having these strange visual disturbances that I can’t seem to shake. I used to smoke for 50 years but quit last year, and I drink alcohol only occasionally, so I can’t help but wonder what’s going on with my body. 

When I went to see the doctor, they examined me and pointed out that my right eyelid was drooping and my pupils were different sizes.

I thought stopping the pills would be the first step toward conceiving, but now I’m just left waiting and worrying.

I’ve taken multiple home pregnancy tests, all of which came back negative. It feels so disheartening. I don’t have any unusual symptoms—no bleeding or spotting, and I’ve never had any STIs.

To make matters worse, I’ve noticed I’ve been feeling increasingly fatigued lately, and I’ve lost weight without even trying.

Lately, I’ve been experiencing this persistent lower abdominal discomfort that feels vague yet unsettling. My menstrual cycle has turned erratic, with spotting and even blood clots appearing more frequently. It’s baffling and alarming, especially since I haven’t had any pain during intercourse or any unusual discharge. Still, the thought of something being wrong weighs heavily on me.

During the examination, the doctor noticed mild bleeding and some tenderness, which only heightened my worries. They performed a hysterosalpingogram, and the results showed sinus tract formation and peritubal adhesions. I can’t help but feel that these findings are serious.

The surgery seemed straightforward, but now I’m wondering if it was something they did during the operation or maybe something that went wrong afterward.

We live in a small rural town in the Appalachian mountains, and I thought maybe it was just teething—she’s been using a teething ring, but this seemed different.

She’s usually such a happy baby, but now she just lay there, and her skin, lips, and tongue had a strange bluish tint. I had to act fast, so I rushed her to the hospital.

101,"I can’t shake off this overwhelming sense of fatigue that’s been creeping in over the past couple of days. I’m 80 years old and usually manage just fine on my own, but lately, I’ve felt like I need to take more naps, even though I sleep well at night. Just yesterday, I tried to carry my usual two bags of groceries from the car, something I’ve always done easily, but I struggled to lift even one. It was exhausting, and I had to rest after each trip. 

I’m really worried because I’ve been feeling this way and I can’t pinpoint why. I don’t have any chest pain, or shortness of breath, and I haven’t been running a fever or coughing—nothing like that. But I did have my grandson over last week, and he had a runny nose and cough. I wonder if I caught something from him. 

When I went to urgent care, the doctors seemed concerned too. I looked tired, but they said everything appeared normal with my tests.

102,"I can’t shake this nagging worry that something is really wrong. For the past eight months, I’ve been dealing with this intense pain in my legs that just won’t go away. It starts after I walk just a block or two, and then it feels like a terrible cramping and tingling radiates down from my buttocks. It’s especially bad when I’m walking downhill; I can barely manage it. The only relief I get is when I sit down or lean forward, but that’s not a long-term solution.

I’m 73, and my medical history isn’t exactly comforting. I’ve been living with hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes for years. I had a heart attack when I was 55 and had surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm at 60. I’ve been a smoker for 30 years—one pack a day—but I don’t drink or do drugs. I take a bunch of medications for my conditions, but this leg pain has me more concerned than usual.

When I went to the doctor, they checked my vitals, and my blood pressure was a bit high. They also did a physical exam, which showed that my muscle strength is okay, but my feet and toes have reduced sensation. They took X-rays of my spine and found some degenerative changes.

My vehicle was stationary when another car hit me from behind at 11 miles per hour. At first, I thought I was okay, but then the intense back pain hit me. It’s unlike anything I’ve felt before. I didn’t have any other symptoms, but this pain is just overwhelming.

I’ve been dealing with back issues for a while now—I’ve been going to physical therapy, and the pain is usually worst in the mornings. It gets a bit better when I’m active, but when I’m inactive, it flares up again. And now, with finals coming up, I’m really worried about my academic performance. I can barely focus with this pain, and I’m scared it’s going to affect my grades.

When I got to the emergency department, I was a bundle of nerves. They checked my vitals, and I know I was tense, but what really got me was the physical exam. They found spinal tenderness and limited motion, which made my anxiety spike.

When I finally went to see the doctor, my vital signs were normal, but the examination revealed the icteric sclerae and those awful scratch marks all over my trunk and arms. I thought maybe it was just a temporary issue, but then they ran some tests, and I felt a wave of dread wash over me. 

The results showed elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and the thought of my liver being involved is haunting me. I can’t stop thinking about what might be going on inside my body. They mentioned something about a procedure called MRCP, which revealed beading in my bile ducts. Now, I’m just sitting here, waiting to hear what the next steps are.

105,"I went to the clinic recently, accompanied by my daughter for what was supposed to be a routine follow-up. Honestly, I felt fine at the time, but my daughter seemed worried. She mentioned that I’ve been feeling more fatigued lately, especially when I exert myself. I’ve also found myself sleeping a lot more than usual, which has me concerned.

Just last week, I finished a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin for a prostate infection, and my urinary symptoms thankfully cleared up. But with my history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, I can’t help but worry. I’m also dealing with moderate vascular dementia, which makes it hard to keep track of everything.

During the examination, they noted my heart rate was unusually low at 45 beats per minute, and I could see the concern on the doctor's face. They found some mild swelling in my legs too, which really freaked me out. I mean, what’s happening to my body?

I even find myself having occasional headaches in the mornings, which only adds to my anxiety.

I’ve ruled out some things—I haven’t lost any hair in unusual places, and there’s no history of trauma or mumps that I know of. I went through puberty just fine, and I’m divorced now with two healthy kids, but I can’t help but feel alarmed about what’s happening to me. 

I learned during my examination that my testicles are smaller than they should be, which is unsettling. My weight is a concern too; my BMI is 38, and I can’t help but wonder if that plays a role.

Honestly, I felt fine, but I couldn’t shake off the worry. My medical history isn't simple; I’ve had an aortic valve replacement and I’m managing type II diabetes. I take several medications like aspirin, warfarin, regular insulin, and atorvastatin, which makes me anxious about potential interactions.

During my visit, my vital signs seemed okay—temperature at 37.0°C, pulse 90, and blood pressure 125/80—but it’s hard not to panic when dealing with all these numbers. Thankfully, the physical exam didn’t reveal anything alarming, but then my healthcare provider mentioned starting fenofibrate for my triglyceride levels. That’s when I started to feel a bit overwhelmed.

He was born vaginally at 38 weeks, and I thought everything went well—no prenatal care, but he was discharged at just two days old with good Apgar scores. I remember feeling so relieved. But now, I can’t help but feel that something is very wrong. He’s not gaining weight like he should; the pediatrician said he’s only in the 10th percentile for his weight and the 20th for his length.

When I took him to the doctor, they found a heart murmur and said his breathing was labored. They mentioned something about his heart being enlarged and that there’s an intracardiac shunt.

I’ve had two pregnancies, and I delivered my second child about a year ago, but I didn’t expect to be dealing with this kind of discomfort now. When I think about it, I’m worried there might be something more serious going on. I haven’t noticed any other symptoms, but the pain is really bothering me, especially when I try to move or bend.

I remember during the examination, the doctor mentioned something about the right sacral sulcus being shallow and that there was tenderness in my lower back muscles.

While they were with us, they checked his blood sugar, which thankfully was normal, but I couldn’t help but feel the weight of every second.

At the hospital, they checked him again, and I noticed he was so agitated and struggling to breathe. His little chest was moving so fast—70 breaths a minute!

I vaguely remember feeling off, but I didn’t realize how serious it had become until she called for help. I could tell something was wrong; I had been acting strangely since losing my job a month ago, but I didn't think it would lead to this. 

When the paramedics arrived, I felt completely out of it. I couldn't open my eyes, and even when they tried to talk to me, all I could manage were some nonsensical sounds. It was terrifying. I remember my wife mentioning that she found an empty bottle of my prescription medication nearby, which made me feel even worse. 

At the hospital, I was lethargic and struggling to breathe. I was so cold, and I could barely feel anything. My heart was racing, but my pulse was low, and I could see the worried looks on the faces of the doctors and nurses.

I remember one night when the pain was so intense that I couldn’t sleep. It felt like it was getting worse whenever I moved around, but oddly, it seemed to ease up a bit when I rested. I’ve heard that this could be a sign of something serious like cervical radiculopathy, but then again, I’m not sure. I’ve also tried holding my arm above my head to see if that helps, and sometimes it does ease the pain, but I’m still feeling so anxious.

I can’t help but wonder if I should see a doctor soon. I mean, the thought of it being something like peripheral neuropathy or even worse has been weighing heavily on my mind.

During the examination, the doctor pressed on my abdomen, and I winced in pain; it felt so distended. I couldn’t help but worry about what was happening inside me.

As soon as he came into the world, his skin had a bluish tint, and he barely let out a weak cry. I remember the panic rising in my chest as I watched him struggle to breathe, gasping for air. The doctors were examining him closely and pointed out several concerning features: his nose was flat, his ears seemed oddly shaped, and his chin was receding. To make matters worse, they discovered that one of his legs was shorter than the other, and his right toe was displaced. 

The sound of diminished breath sounds filled the room, and my heart sank further. They mentioned something about his kidneys not looking right on an ultrasound, too.

I remember those months of fatigue, joint pain, and, worst of all, the bloody diarrhea. It was terrifying. After trying mesalamine and glucocorticoids without relief, I was put on prednisone. The relief was almost immediate, but as I tried to taper my dose down to 2.5 mg, I was met with overwhelming fatigue and nausea. It’s like every time I take a step forward, I’m pushed two steps back. 

Now, I’m on 5 mg daily, which keeps things somewhat stable, but I can’t help but worry about my back pain and the fact that I have bone metastases. The recent CT scan showed stable lesions, but it also revealed a fracture in my vertebrae. It’s hard to focus on anything else.

I’m 62 and I already deal with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes, which makes everything feel so much scarier. My medications include metformin, metoprolol, and a few others, but I wasn’t sure if any of that could be causing this. The doctor examined me and found the same symptoms I was worried about—vulvar redness and that thick discharge. They even did a test that revealed pseudohyphae, which I later learned is often linked to yeast infections.

Now, after receiving treatment for what they think is a genitourinary issue, I can't stop wondering what the next step should be.

I’ve tried to convince myself it’s just a passing issue, but the unease only deepened.

I went to the clinic today, hoping for some reassurance. I explained to the doctor that I hadn’t experienced any burning when urinating, no flank pain, and thankfully, no bleeding. But during the examination, I could feel my heart racing a bit when the doctor noted tenderness in my abdomen and the fluid wave. The bimanual pelvic exam revealed something concerning—right adnexal fullness. What does that even mean?

I’ve tried to push through it, but the pain really makes it hard to enjoy my workouts like I used to. 

When I visited the clinic, I hoped for some answers. The doctor did an examination and mentioned something about restrictions in my spine, specifically around T5 to T10. I could barely touch my toes or bend backward without feeling sharp pain. I felt so helpless when they pointed out that my T7 was positioned oddly.

It’s hard to forget the worry etched on the doctors’ faces. And then there were the three episodes of ear infections, each one making me feel more helpless than the last.

His birth was unremarkable; everything went smoothly, and I had hoped that would mean good health for him.

I’ve been in the hospital, and they’ve been keeping a close eye on me because of some complications from wound cellulitis.

He was born premature at 35 weeks, and I thought we had made it past the tough stuff. He breastfed for three months, then switched to formula, and I never imagined we’d face something like this now.

I felt a knot tightening in my stomach when they mentioned a vegetation on my aortic valve. They took blood cultures, and I could see the worry in the doctors' faces as they discussed what it might mean.

Now, I’m stuck here, waiting for answers and wondering what could have caused this. I can't help but think about all the things I've done in the past—was it the dental work I had a while back, or perhaps something related to my heart? The uncertainty is terrifying.

160,"I can’t shake this feeling of worry that started when I began experiencing some troubling symptoms. It’s been two weeks now, and I’ve been dealing with constipation, abdominal pain, and this uncomfortable bloating that just won’t go away. I used to have soft bowel movements every other day, but now it’s a struggle to go every three to four days, and when I do, it’s painful, with hard stools that I have to strain to pass. Thankfully, there hasn’t been any blood, but that doesn’t ease my mind.

I take a few medications daily—docusate to help with the constipation, prune juice as needed, a low dose of aspirin, and amitriptyline for my depression, which I just started a month ago. I went to see the doctor, and while my vital signs were okay, the examination revealed some tenderness in my abdomen and a small anal fissure. 

I can’t help but feel anxious about what might be causing all of this. I know I need to manage it, but what’s the best next step? I’m terrified that this could lead to something more serious.

It all started when I began my new job, which has me walking several miles each day throughout this huge facility. At first, I thought it was just fatigue, but then the low back pain kicked in, and it’s been relentless. The pain is localized to my back, and thankfully, it hasn’t shot down into my legs or anything—still, I can’t help but feel anxious.

I haven't had any falls or injuries that I can think of, which makes this even more puzzling. I’ve only been on oral contraceptives for birth control, so I’m not sure what else could be going on. I decided to get it checked out, and during the examination, the doctor noted that my muscle strength, tone, and reflexes seemed normal, which at least offered a bit of relief. However, they mentioned that my left sacral sulcus is deeper than the right and that there were some other concerning findings.

I take my medications—iron, vitamins, and hydroxychloroquine—very seriously, and I don’t use any substances.

My vital signs were stable, but I felt a knot in my stomach the entire time. The physical exam felt normal, but the ultrasound results left me feeling uneasy.

I’ve noticed I’m sometimes short of breath, which is really alarming.

I went to see my doctor, hoping for some answers. They took my vital signs, and everything seemed okay, but then I noticed the worried look on their face during the examination. They mentioned something about scleral icterus and a tender liver, which only made my anxiety spike. 

I’ve had a complicated medical history, including hepatitis E during my first pregnancy and a blood transfusion after a car accident years ago. I drink a couple of pints of beer a week, but I never thought it would lead to something more serious. When they mentioned that an ultrasound showed a liver mass, my heart sank.

At first, I brushed it off, but as time went on, my legs felt heavier and walking became a struggle. I work at a health food store and follow a strict vegan diet, which I thought was healthy. I take various supplements, but nothing seems to help.

Over the past year, my strength has declined significantly. I can hardly walk without feeling weak and unsteady, and now I'm experiencing daily bouts of weakness and even non-bloody diarrhea. I’ve had a history of Crohn's disease since my twenties, along with celiac disease, but it’s been manageable—until now. 

When I visited my doctor, I was shocked by how weak I felt during the examination. My strength was rated only 3 out of 5, and my reflexes were absent.

When I got to the emergency department, I was scared. They examined me and found tenderness in my humerus and elbow. I couldn’t even extend my wrist properly, but thankfully, I could still move my arm without pain. They told me I had a mid-shaft humeral fracture and a small olecranon fracture, but I just wanted to know what this all meant for me.

I’ve always been careful, using oral contraceptive pills, and I didn’t even think I should be concerned about anything.

So, when the results came back, I was blindsided. They found atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and to make matters worse, the HPV test came back positive.

When I finally went to the emergency department, I was anxious about what they might find. My temperature was slightly elevated, and even though my blood pressure seemed okay, my pulse felt fast. I was struggling to breathe normally, with my respirations at 29 per minute. And then, the examination revealed that I could barely move my legs—my strength was down to 2 out of 5.

At first, I thought maybe it was just a bad day, but things got worse quickly. The pain is now symmetrical, and I can barely move without wincing.

Even more concerning, my shoes and rings don’t fit like they used to, and my voice feels deeper. I haven’t experienced anything like this since I was 18!

I remember looking in the mirror, and I didn’t recognize the person staring back at me. I looked so frail, almost ghost-like.

My friend rushed me to the emergency department because I just couldn’t communicate or follow any instructions. I was in a state of distress, and it felt terrifying.

I hadn’t kept up with my medical check-ups after that; I don’t know why I let it slip.

Shortly after that, I felt dizzy—so dizzy that I collapsed right into my daughter’s arms. I remember her voice, shaky and worried, calling for help.

They did some examinations and told me I was positive for blood in my stool, even though I wasn't passing anything bloody anymore. I could tell they were concerned.

220,"I can't shake this feeling of dread as I think back over the last four months. It all started with this awful, recurrent abdominal pain—sharp and persistent. At first, I thought it was just something I ate, but it didn’t go away. Then, I noticed my stools were foul-smelling and greasy, which was really alarming. I’ve lost about 11 pounds, and I haven’t changed my appetite at all. I’m eating the same, but the weight keeps dropping, and that just makes me more anxious.

When I finally decided to see a doctor, they pressed on my abdomen, and I felt this tenderness on the right side that made me wince. I didn’t know what to think. They ran some tests, and I found out my fasting blood sugar was higher than it should be—186 mg/dL. It’s frightening to think there might be something seriously wrong.

Then came the ultrasound, which revealed these strange round spots in my gallbladder.

I was sweating profusely, and I could feel my heart racing in my chest—it was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out. I felt lightheaded and a bit confused, which really scared me. 

My colleague noticed something was off and rushed me to the emergency department. I’ve had similar episodes three times in the past month, but I never thought they would lead me here. I don’t have any ongoing medical issues, and I’m not on any medications. My family history isn’t great either; my relative has Grave’s disease, which has been weighing on my mind.

When I went to the doctor, they took my vital signs, and everything seemed okay on the surface—my pulse was 72, blood pressure was 135 over 75, and my respiratory rate was 20. But during the exam, the doctor noticed my chest was oddly shaped and my breath sounds weren’t right. The worst part? They mentioned something about a chest X-ray showing widened spaces between my ribs and a flattened diaphragm. I can't help but think about what that means for me.

The thought of being at high risk for something serious is terrifying. I keep wondering if I could be facing conditions like pulmonary hypertension or even something worse.

He started vomiting—three times, I counted—each episode making my stomach twist tighter with worry.

When we finally arrived at the emergency department, I could see that he was disoriented, moaning softly with his eyes closed. It was terrifying to watch him struggle to respond, only opening his eyes when someone spoke to him. I held his right hand, which had a nasty blister on the palm, the skin red and angry-looking. I tried to stay calm, but my heart raced as I thought about the pain he might be in.

The doctors examined him, checking his vital signs and his heart. They reassured me that his breathing was stable, but I couldn’t help feeling overwhelmed.

It hurts so much more when I run or change direction, and honestly, it’s starting to scare me.

That thought alone had me on edge, but what I heard during the examination made it even worse.

The doctor found some concerning things during the physical exam. He pointed out that my son has enhanced thoracic kyphosis and noticed that his right scapula was positioned strangely, even when he was standing straight.

We haven’t noticed any signs like poor feeding, vomiting, or lethargy, but what if something’s brewing under the surface? There’s no family history of metabolic disorders, which is a slight comfort, but it doesn’t erase my concerns.

During the examination, the doctor said she appeared normal and didn’t have any detectable issues like hepatomegaly. Still, I keep wondering what we should do next. Should we be doing more tests? Is there something we should change in her feeding? I just want to make sure she’s healthy and safe. It feels overwhelming, and I can’t help but worry about what the future holds for her.","A.

I rushed him to the emergency department, my heart racing the whole way. He’s never had anything like this before, and I couldn’t help but worry. 

As we waited, I remembered that he has a history of nosebleeds, which always made me uneasy. But joint swelling? That was new. I started to panic when I thought about the medication mix-up that could have happened. I give anticoagulants to his grandfather daily, mixing them in his milk, and I just kept thinking—what if something went wrong? 

To make matters worse, I recalled that several of my brothers had bleeding disorders, but we never really knew what they were. I felt so helpless. The doctors did some tests, and I overheard them discussing elevated bleeding times and PTT results. I couldn’t understand all the medical jargon, but every word made my stomach churn.

I’ve gained about 10 pounds without any changes in my appetite, and I’ve been struggling with constipation, which is just adding to my stress. 

What worries me most is this persistent fatigue that makes it hard to focus on my work and family. I even find it difficult to bend my neck sometimes, and that’s just not normal for me. I’ve been smoking for about 10 years, and I do drink occasionally, but I thought I was managing it all fairly well. 

I take just a multivitamin and fish oil, hoping that would be enough. When I went to see a doctor, they noted my temperature was normal, but my pulse was surprisingly slow at 58 beats per minute. They found a mobile, nontender mass in my neck, which really freaked me out. Plus, my skin has been unusually dry, and I’m concerned about the delayed reflexes they mentioned during the exam.

I remember feeling alarmed as my heart raced at 117 beats per minute and my breathing quickened, too. My blood pressure dropped, and I felt this overwhelming fatigue. It was like my body was fighting something I couldn’t see. 

I thought getting my Covid-19 vaccinations would keep me safe, but when I tested negative, I felt this sinking feeling. What was happening to me? I was admitted to the hospital, and they started me on antibiotics for pneumonia, but instead of getting better, my breathing worsened, and I felt even more exhausted.

I’m really trying not to panic, but I can’t help it. I don’t have any numbness or tingling, and thankfully no issues with bladder or bowel control, but the pain just won’t go away. When I went to the clinic, the doctor checked me out and said my back has increased lumbar lordosis, which sounds serious. They did some tests, and while I could move my back without much trouble, extending it really made the pain worse.

To add to my stress, I’ve been dealing with anxiety, which I manage with fluvoxamine. And then there’s my osteopenia; I just can’t help but feel overwhelmed. I recently returned from Uganda three months ago, and I can’t shake the thought that something might have happened while I was there. 

When I went to the clinic, my vitals seemed stable, but the doctor found a new systolic ejection murmur during the exam. I couldn’t help but feel a chill run down my spine. My mother has lactose intolerance and was just diagnosed with osteoporosis, so I can’t help but worry about my own health.

The doctor mentioned that recovery timelines can vary, but I’ve read different things online. Some say I might be back to normal in as little as six weeks post-op, while others suggest it could take up to three months. I just want to make the right choice about when it’s safe to drive again. 

Every day, I’m trying to assess my progress. I know I need to regain full range of motion in my ankle and knee, but how will I know when I’m ready? Will I be able to trust my body again?

I can't even remember when it started; there wasn't a specific injury that I can recall, but I do have this history of ankle sprains from playing soccer when I was younger. 

I finally decided to see someone about it because the pain was getting worse. During the exam, the doctor pressed on my lower back, and it felt particularly tender there. I noticed that bending forward or backward made it even worse. When they did some tests, they pointed out that my right side seemed off—something about my right posterior superior iliac spine being more elevated and the sacral area feeling shallow. The asymmetry was concerning, especially when I moved into different positions.

Just three days ago, I had undergone a coronary stent placement after my heart attack, and it feels like everything is falling apart.

I’ve been managing my diabetes and trying to remember my medications, but with my Alzheimer’s, it’s becoming increasingly hard.

It started after I spent a whole day gardening last week, and while acetaminophen helps a bit in the mornings, I can’t ignore how it’s affecting my daily life.

But that’s not all. Just a week ago, I noticed something alarming—new-onset urinary incontinence. I find myself needing to rush to the bathroom frequently, and sometimes I just can’t fully empty my bladder. It’s so embarrassing, especially since it’s not linked to sneezing or laughing like I’ve heard can happen. I can’t help but feel anxious about it.

I remember the paramedics arriving, but I was so disoriented. They said I lost a lot of blood, which explains why I felt so weak and confused.

When I got to the emergency department, everything became a blur. I could barely respond; my Glasgow Coma Scale score was at a frightening 3. They had to intubate me and start IVs. I felt like I was slipping away as they rushed to prepare for surgery. They told me they were following a massive transfusion protocol, yet I could barely comprehend it. 

I remember feeling cold, so cold, despite the room being warm. My blood pressure was alarmingly low, and my pulse was weak. They were trying everything to stabilize me, infusing blood and platelets, but nothing seemed to change. I could hear the doctors discussing my condition, and I felt a wave of fear wash over me.

It's strange because I can't pinpoint any trauma that might have caused it. I spend most of my day in front of a laptop as a software engineer, which probably isn’t helping. 

I also have diabetes and high blood pressure, which I worry might complicate things. I don't smoke, but I do enjoy a few beers on the weekends. I recently went to see a doctor about my neck pain, and during the examination, they found that my neck has some restricted movement. It’s concerning, especially when I think about what could be wrong.

The doctor mentioned something about a treatment they want to do called HVLA, but before that, they talked about needing to run some diagnostic tests first.

Thankfully, I stay on top of my immunizations, and I don't smoke or drink, but the distress I felt during my examination was palpable. The doctor said my temperature was quite high, and I was really struggling to catch my breath.

My temperature was sky-high at 105°F, and my heart was racing at 167 beats per minute. I could see the concern in the faces of the medical staff as they rushed around me.

It felt surreal when I suddenly experienced a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted what felt like forever, but I later learned it was just a minute.

I’ve always been healthy, with no significant medical issues, so this was all very unsettling.

I remember the doctor examining me and noting the bruising and tenderness around my clavicle. The pain was sharp, and I felt terrified about what they might find. After a chest x-ray, my heart sank as I learned about the nondisplaced fracture in my collarbone. But then, they mentioned a pulmonary nodule in my left lung. A solid one, with well-defined borders.

I’ve been drinking a couple of alcoholic drinks every night, which has me concerned. I’ve had just three sexual partners in my life and I use oral contraceptives, but I’ve never been pregnant. During my visit, I noticed the doctor seemed particularly focused on my weight and the swelling in my hands—I could see it in my fingers, which were bent unnaturally.

My vital signs were stable, but my liver enzymes were elevated, and that’s what really has me on edge. I can’t help but wonder if my drinking could be catching up with me or if it’s something more serious, like an autoimmune issue.

But despite all that, she just can’t stand. I keep replaying our playtime in my head, and it feels like a punch in the gut each time I remember her struggling to pull herself up. 

She was born healthy, at 40 weeks, and has always been on track with her growth. There’s no family history of developmental issues, which adds to my confusion. During the appointment, the doctor examined her, and while she was playful and interactive, the fact that she couldn’t stand—either on her own or with help—left me feeling uneasy. 

I can’t help but wonder what this means for her future. Should I be worried about something more serious? The doctor talked about next steps, but I’m just overwhelmed and scared.

He’s usually a healthy baby, always up-to-date on his vaccinations and hitting all his developmental milestones. But when we got to the ER, things only got worse. His temperature was 38°C, and his heart rate was racing at 180. I could see he was struggling to breathe, and the nurse said his oxygen levels were low.

At first, I thought it was just a normal reaction, but when it didn’t go away after a few minutes, I started to worry. 

I remembered hearing that if you have these kinds of symptoms, especially if they get worse or don’t resolve, it could be serious. I had experienced this kind of thing before, but never this intensely. I started thinking about the potential consequences of ignoring it. What if it was something more serious? What if I had done real damage? 

I couldn’t shake the thought of whether I should get an MRI before returning to play. I heard stories of players who rushed back and ended up with long-term issues.

During his first few weeks, he did have some mild abdominal distention, but the doctors assured me it was nothing serious. He even passed meconium after a contrast enema, and we were sent home thinking everything was okay.

Just two months ago, I was on a safari in Africa, and I took chloroquine as a precaution, even continuing it for four weeks after returning.

I’m 65 and have been struggling with type 2 diabetes for over 30 years, but lately, things have taken a turn for the worse. Despite my efforts, my blood sugar management has been poor, and I’ve developed some serious complications—retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. 

In the last three months, I’ve lost about 7 kg, which really worries me. I’ve been feeling full after just a few bites, and there's this nagging discomfort in my stomach. To make matters worse, I’ve been dealing with nausea and vomiting after meals, which only gets better when I don’t eat. My bowel movements seem normal, but I can’t help but feel that something is off. 

I’m on insulin glargine at night and insulin aspart before meals, but it doesn’t feel like enough anymore.

I thought it was just an annoyance at first, but it quickly worsened. I’m 78, and I already have my share of health issues—hypertension and COPD—and the fact that I’m paralyzed below the waist from a previous injury only adds to my worries.

When I ended up in the emergency department, I was running a fever of 101.7°F, which felt alarming. My heart was racing and I felt so weak. The doctors examined me and confirmed the tenderness in my abdomen. It was scary to think that my chronic urinary catheter might be causing more problems. They took samples for blood and urine cultures, which added another layer of anxiety as I waited for answers.

On top of that, I’ve been urinating more frequently and have gained some weight around my abdomen, which is so concerning.

Lately, I’ve been getting these intermittent headaches, and today it was pretty bad—like a 6 out of 10 on the pain scale. When they took my blood pressure again, it was even higher—142/90 mm Hg.

He was cyanotic, gasping for breath, and his little body was struggling to breathe regularly.

As I held him, I noticed his low-set ears and broad auricles—features that seemed so out of place. His nasal tip was flattened, and I could see that his jaw was smaller than it should be, with the lower part pushed back. It broke my heart to see that he had a clubfoot on his right side. I felt an overwhelming wave of worry wash over me.

I had delivered him at home, and everything seemed fine until I noticed some blood-tinged fluid just four hours before labor. That didn’t feel right, but I brushed it off as normal. I hadn’t seen a doctor since my first trimester, and I worried about whether I had done enough for him.

I didn’t change my eating habits or exercise routine, yet my clothes are tight, and I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin. My libido has dropped significantly, which has left me anxious about my health and relationships. To make matters worse, I’ve been struggling to sleep, tossing and turning every night.

I’ve noticed my skin has turned oily and even started breaking out, which is unusual for me. I’ve always been a bit of a smoker—about a pack a day for the last decade—but I didn’t think it would lead to anything like this. I feel lethargic and my energy is just gone.

I went back to the clinic for a follow-up, and while I did receive some osteopathic manipulative treatment, my pain has only slightly improved. It’s so frustrating!

During the exam, the doctor mentioned that my L5 vertebra is rotated to the right, which sounds serious. They said it becomes more aligned when I bend forward, but honestly, that didn’t reassure me much. To make matters worse, I found out that the right sacral sulcus is deep, while the left side is lower. The rest of the exam seemed fine, but I can’t help but feel like something is still off.

Now, I’m left wondering which additional test might confirm what’s happening with my sacrum. I keep thinking about all the options they talked about, and it’s hard not to feel anxious.

It feels like every time I exert myself—even just walking up the stairs—I'm gasping for air. Sometimes, the cough brings up clear sputum and there’s this wheezing that’s really unsettling. 

I thought it was asthma, so I’ve been following the treatment plan. I’ve tried inhaled steroids, a leukotriene blocker, and bronchodilators. I even took multiple rounds of antibiotics, thinking maybe it was an infection, but nothing has helped. I’m relieved I haven’t lost weight or had night sweats, and I haven’t traveled recently or smoked, so I keep wondering—what could it be? 

When I went to the doctor, they did some tests. I felt a bit of relief when they said my heart rate and oxygen levels were stable, but the wheezing on one side of my chest is troubling.

My history isn’t exactly the best—alcohol use disorder, depression, and I had my aortic and mitral valves replaced. I’ve been taking bupropion, citalopram, and warfarin, but things took a turn for the worse on the fifth day of my stay.

I started running a fever and was harder to wake up than usual. It scared me to feel so out of it! I tried to explain to the nurses that I didn’t have a cough, nor was I short of breath or in pain anywhere. Yet, something felt very wrong. They did some blood tests, and I overheard them mention leukocytosis. My urinalysis didn’t show anything alarming, and my chest X-ray looked fine, but I just couldn’t shake this feeling of dread.

The doctors reassured me that the lesion is confined to the sella, without any alarming signs of extension or involvement with the pituitary stalk, but I can’t help but feel anxious about what this all means for my health.

I’ve been keeping track of my symptoms, or lack thereof, but I still feel unsettled. Thankfully, I haven’t experienced any visual disturbances or signs of hypercortisolism, which I read can be serious. Since going through menopause at 51, I haven’t had any hot flashes or other hormonal symptoms either, but the elevated prolactin levels—107 ng/mL—have me on edge.

I have a history of peptic ulcer disease, but I haven't been taking the omeprazole I was prescribed. I really thought I could manage it on my own, but now I’m not so sure. When I finally went to the emergency department, I was terrified. They checked my temperature and vital signs, and thankfully, they were mostly normal. Still, the mild tenderness in my abdomen is nagging at me. 

I didn’t expect them to find black stool during the digital rectal exam. It’s such a scary thought.

At first, I thought it was just a minor bump, but now I’m not so sure. I’ve been taking over-the-counter pain relievers, and while they help a bit, the headaches keep coming back. I’ve noticed that I don’t feel nauseous, and I haven’t lost consciousness, but something feels off.

When I went to see the doctor, I was nervous. They checked my cranial nerves and said everything seemed intact, but I could tell they were concerned during the examination.

I’m 59 years old, and I have a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, which makes me feel even more anxious.

When I finally went to see the doctor, my blood pressure was 132/88, which didn’t seem too bad to me. My heart rate was steady, and I felt okay on the surface—my temperature was normal, and my oxygen levels were good. But then the doctor mentioned something about my vision. I didn’t even realize it until they tested me and found I have bitemporal hemianopsia. That really scared me. 

They checked my heart and lungs, which seemed fine, but I could feel the dread creeping in as they noted the slight swelling in my legs.

I had chlamydia during my first trimester, but I thought that was all behind us after the treatment.

I tried to reassure myself when the doctor asked about any symptoms, and I was relieved to say I wasn’t experiencing chest pain or shortness of breath.

He’s been more agitated lately, and it’s like he can’t express any pain or discomfort, which makes it even more frustrating and scary for both of us.

During the examination, the doctor mentioned something that really stuck with me. They noted the greater wings of the sphenoid were higher than the occiput, which is concerning.
