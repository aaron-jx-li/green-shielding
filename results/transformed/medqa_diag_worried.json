It all started about three months ago when I began feeling an unusual fatigue that just wouldn\u2019t go away. I\u2019m 66, so I thought maybe it was just part of getting older, but deep down, I knew something wasn\u2019t right.\n\nI've dealt with hypertension and high cholesterol for years, and I even had a transient ischemic attack three years ago, which still makes me anxious. I try to keep things in check with my medications\u2014aspirin, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol\u2014but lately, it feels like that\u2019s not enough.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that my skin looks pale and there are these strange, tiny red spots on my arms and legs that don\u2019t go away. It\u2019s unsettling. I also went to see my doctor, and while he didn\u2019t seem alarmed, he did mention that my spleen felt enlarged. That really caught my attention. I kept thinking, what does that mean? \n\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed my beers, usually around three a day, but now I can\u2019t help but wonder if that\u2019s contributing to my problems. I\u2019m just so concerned about what all of this could mean for my health. I feel like I\u2019m in a fog, and I really need to know what\u2019s going on before it gets worse.",

The review of symptoms includes complaints of increasing abdominal girth, early satiety, and difficulty breathing on exertion. The past medical history includes essential hypertension for 19 years. The medication list includes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. He had a right inguinal hernia repair when he was a teenager. He smokes 20\u201330 cigarettes daily for the last 21 years, and drinks alcohol socially. His father died of a hemorrhagic stroke at the age of 69 years. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 131/88 mm Hg, and pulse 82/min. The physical examination is positive for a palpable right upper quadrant mass.

To make matters worse, my stomach has been getting bigger, and I can\u2019t seem to eat without feeling overly full. Even simple tasks leave me breathless, which is so frustrating. \n\nI\u2019ve had high blood pressure for nearly two decades, and I take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide to manage it. I\u2019ve also been a smoker for 21 years, averaging about a pack a day, and I drink socially, but I never thought it would lead to something like this. \n\nWhat worries me most is my family history; my father passed away from a hemorrhagic stroke at just 69. I\u2019m trying to stay calm, but the thought of what might be going on inside me is terrifying. The doctors found a palpable mass in my upper right abdomen, and they mentioned something about cysts on my kidneys and liver during the ultrasound. I can\u2019t help but wonder what it all means. I just hope they can figure this out quickly before it gets any worse.",

I\u2019ve never seen my stool so pale, and my urine? It's almost dark enough to be alarming. \n\nMy son brought me to the doctor, and I was so worried. Three years ago, I had this awful upper abdominal pain that landed me in the hospital. They treated me with IV fluids and painkillers, and I thought I was okay after that. I quit drinking alcohol after that incident, but I smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 50 years. \n\nDuring the examination, the doctor noted the yellowing in my eyes and skin. I could feel my heart racing as he felt around my abdomen and mentioned something about a cystic mass in my right upper quadrant. I just wanted answers, but I could see the concern in his eyes. What if this is serious? The thought of my bile ducts being dilated\u2014it all sounds so scary. I keep thinking about what this could mean for my future.

But I couldn\u2019t help but worry\u2014what was really happening to me? \n\nThey ran an echocardiogram, and I heard the doctor say it looked normal, which was a small comfort.

I remember feeling a rush of panic as I finally decided to head to the emergency room.\n\nOnce there, I was given numerous treatments, but nothing seemed to help. I had to agree to elective intubation, and they transferred me to the ICU. The worry sank in deeper when I learned I had developed pneumonia during my stay. They started me on a cocktail of antibiotics, and I was reliant on a feeding tube and fluids. The thought of not being able to breathe properly, of being trapped on a ventilator, haunted me.\n\nOn the seventh day, I felt a wave of dread when I realized how difficult it was to wean off the ventilator. My breaths felt labored, and I could see the concern in the nurse's eyes as she changed my dressing. I remember wincing in pain, feeling the sharp increase in pressure.

The doctors examined me and said I had stiffness and pain in the specific joints, but they didn\u2019t seem overly concerned. They sent me home with ibuprofen, which barely helped. \n\nA few weeks later, I went back to my primary doctor, and thankfully, the symptoms had improved, and I wasn\u2019t even taking any medication anymore.

    "transformed_question_worried": "For the past three months, I've been really struggling with swallowing, and it\u2019s been worrying me more than I\u2019d like to admit. Whenever I eat solid food, it feels like everything gets stuck in my chest, right behind my sternum. I can\u2019t shake off the feeling, and it makes me anxious every time I sit down for a meal. The odd thing is, drinking liquids doesn\u2019t seem to cause any problems, which just adds to my confusion.\n\nI\u2019ve had heartburn for about two years now, and despite taking high doses of omeprazole, nothing seems to help. I can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s something more serious going on. Thankfully, I haven\u2019t experienced any coughing, nasal regurgitation, or weight loss, but I can\u2019t shake this gnawing worry. My medical history includes asthma and eczema, and aside from the omeprazole, I\u2019m not on any other medications.\n\nI went to see the doctor recently, hoping to get some answers, but the physical exam didn\u2019t reveal anything unusual. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating to feel so uncomfortable and not know why. I keep thinking about what could be causing this and if I should be more concerned. I just want to find out what\u2019s going on and hope it\u2019s nothing too serious.",

I had no prenatal care, so I feared the worst.\n\nThe doctors quickly examined him, and while they found normal heart sounds, they also noted intercostal retractions and nasal flaring, which only heightened my anxiety. They took an x-ray of his chest, and I could hardly stand the wait for results. When they told me it showed low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities, I felt completely overwhelmed. The medical terms felt so distant and cold against the reality of my fragile little boy.\n\nThey started him on nasal continuous positive airway pressure, but I couldn't help but think about what might come next. What else could they find? My mind raced with questions and fears. I just want him to be okay, to breathe freely like any other baby. The uncertainty is almost too much to bear. I keep praying for him to get stronger and for the doctors to have the answers we desperately need.",

I\u2019ve been dealing with diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and even depression, but this felt different\u2014much worse. I smoke about a pack and a half a day and can easily drink ten beers at night, but I never thought that would catch up with me like this.\n\nWhen I finally made it to the emergency department, I felt so weak and anxious. My blood pressure was alarmingly low, and my heart was racing. The doctors were poking and prodding, and I could feel the concern in their voices. They mentioned something about abdominal tenderness and took all sorts of tests, but I just couldn\u2019t focus on anything except the nagging fear of what was happening to me. I keep wondering what could be wrong; it\u2019s terrifying not knowing.",

It started with my legs; I get tired so easily whenever I walk, and it\u2019s truly exhausting. Sometimes, the pain and swelling are so bad that I can barely cope. I\u2019ve had my share of health issues\u2014obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and even a heart attack in the past. The thought of my 52 years of smoking haunts me, too.\n\nLately, I've been feeling even more anxious because I've started to fall. Just the other day, I stumbled while trying to get to the kitchen. My husband is always there to help, but I can see the worry in his eyes, and it makes me feel helpless. When I went to the doctor, my blood pressure was sky-high, and I had a slight fever. They heard some wheezing when they examined my lungs, and I could feel the murmur in my chest. I can't stop thinking about what all of this means. Something is definitely wrong with my legs, and I\u2019m terrified of what it could lead to. What if this is just the beginning of something worse?",

I take methyldopa, folic acid, and a multivitamin, but I know I\u2019ve let my health slip. My pulse was racing at 90 beats per minute, and although my blood pressure was high at 145/90, it felt like my heart was about to break. \n\nThe doctors told me my abdomen was tender, and I felt those strong contractions. I could see blood\u2014on the vulva, the introitus, and even on my thighs. It was a horrifying sight. I was informed that my baby was in a breech position, and the heart rate was alarmingly high at 180 beats per minute, with some concerning dips. I can't help but worry: what does all this mean for my baby? Will everything be okay?",

I used to use drugs, too, so I know I haven\u2019t always made the best choices.\n\nWhen I went in for my check-up, my heart was racing, and I felt so pale. They told me my oxygen levels were low, and my heart was in atrial fibrillation. I\u2019ve been having cognitive issues too, which terrifies me. To top it all off, my blood work showed alarming levels of white blood cells and other abnormalities. I can\u2019t help but wonder what could be wrong with me.

I\u2019m so worried about what this all means and what\u2019s happening to me. I just want to feel normal again.",

The doctors started checking my ankle, and I felt this sinking feeling as they explained how I had rolled it into a position that involved both plantar flexion and inversion. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t find any point tenderness on either the inside or outside of my ankle, which was a small relief. But then they did the anterior drawer test, and I could see the concern on their faces when it came back positive. The talar tilt test was negative, but I couldn\u2019t shake my worry. \n\nNow I'm left wondering what the injury could be and how long it\u2019s going to take for me to get back on the field.

She\u2019s just four years old and already dealing with recurrent asthma attacks, which has been stressful enough. But for the past two weeks, she\u2019s been complaining about mild abdominal pain, and I couldn't help but feel anxious about it.\n\nDuring the follow-up examination, I remember how the physician seemed calm while checking her over. My daughter appeared fine at the time, her temperature was normal, and her heart rate was steady. Still, I couldn\u2019t shake the unease in my gut. They listened to her lungs and checked her heart, and thankfully, everything sounded clear. But when they examined her abdomen, that\u2019s when my heart dropped. They found a smooth mass on the left side that didn\u2019t seem to bother her, but the fact that it was there made me feel so uneasy.\n\nI kept thinking about what it could mean. I know they were going to run some tests, but until we have answers, I feel like I\u2019m in limbo. I just want to make sure she\u2019s okay. The unknown is so terrifying, and all I can think about is how to protect my little girl from whatever this could be.",

It\u2019s strange because I can\u2019t remember any specific injury that caused it. I\u2019ve seen two doctors, but neither could figure out what was wrong. Recently, I've also started feeling bloated and constipated, which is really unsettling. This all began about three weeks ago, and after doing some frantic searching online, I can't shake the fear that it could be pancreatic cancer. \n\nI just want to get a CT scan of my abdomen for peace of mind. My past experiences with chest pain have already left me on edge, even though those tests came back normal. I don\u2019t smoke or drink, but the stress from my job is overwhelming with constant performance evaluations. I try to take care of myself with multivitamins and glucosamine, but sometimes it feels like it isn\u2019t enough.\n\nWhen I went to the doctor recently, they examined my abdomen and said it felt soft and normal, but I still can\u2019t help but worry.

They ordered some tests, and now I can\u2019t stop thinking about what those results might mean. \n\nI\u2019m terrified about the bone marrow biopsy they performed. The thought of it being hypocellular and not finding any abnormal cells has me on edge. What does it mean for me? I just want to know what\u2019s happening.

But I didn\u2019t take them last week because of some unexpected travel, and now I\u2019m starting to think that might be part of the problem.\n\nI remember recovering from that viral hepatitis six months ago, but now I\u2019m feeling this heaviness in my chest. I can\u2019t help but notice the swelling around my eyes and my ankles\u2014it\u2019s so uncomfortable. My heart feels like it\u2019s racing, and my blood pressure is through the roof. I can hardly catch my breath, and there are these crackling sounds in my chest when I breathe.\n\nI\u2019m really scared. I just want to know what\u2019s happening to me. Why can\u2019t I breathe? Why do I feel so weak? I\u2019m worried that something is seriously wrong, and I just need answers. I hope I can get some help soon.",

I don\u2019t smoke or drink, and I\u2019m not on any medications, so I keep wondering why this is happening to me.\n\nWhen I finally decided to see my primary care provider, I hoped for some answers. The examination revealed some dried blood in my nasal passage and unilateral nasal obstruction, which just makes me more anxious. I\u2019ve been trying to stay calm, but the combination of these symptoms has left me feeling really concerned about what could be going on. I just want to understand why this is happening and if I need to worry about my health.",

But I\u2019ve been experiencing these occasional abdominal pains that really worry me. They aren\u2019t constant, but when they hit, they\u2019re a solid 4 to 5 out of 10 in intensity. It feels like they\u2019re coming from around my belly button and up in my upper abdomen, sometimes radiating down to my groin. Thankfully, they usually go away on their own after a bit, but they come about once or twice a month, and that just doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\nI\u2019ve had a history of high blood pressure and cholesterol, and I\u2019ve been managing those with medication. I\u2019ve also been smoking for years and enjoy a couple of drinks daily, which I know isn\u2019t great for me. During the check-up, my blood pressure was quite high, and the doctor found a bruit in my abdomen and even felt a pulsating mass. That really got my heart racing\u2014I couldn\u2019t believe it. \n\nI haven\u2019t had any fever, chills, or changes in weight or my bathroom habits, but I can\u2019t help but feel anxious. What could this mean? The doctor didn\u2019t say much, but I\u2019m left wondering if there\u2019s something serious going on. I just hope it\u2019s nothing to worry about.",

My heart raced as I approached him, realizing he was completely barefoot. Panic set in when I saw he was unconscious. \n\nI rushed to call for help, feeling utterly helpless. When the paramedics arrived, I watched them check his vitals. His heart rate was alarmingly low at 45 beats per minute, and his breathing was shallow, only 10 breaths per minute. They mentioned something about his blood pressure being on the low side too. \n\nAs they handled him, I noticed his skin\u2014his palms and feet were covered in blisters, and the yellow, waxy appearance made me worry even more. I remember thinking about how unresponsive he was, not even reacting to the loud noises around him. I couldn\u2019t understand how someone could end up like this, exposed to the cold without proper clothing. It broke my heart to think about the serious cold-related injuries he must be suffering from. I just hope he gets the care he needs in time.",

He has been sexually active with a single partner since their marriage at 24 years of age. The physical examination reveals erythematous, crusted plaques with central ulceration and a raised border. There is no fluctuance, drainage, or sporotrichoid spread. A punch biopsy was performed, which revealed an ulcerated lesion with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Amastigotes within dermal macrophages are seen on Giemsa staining. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

At first, they were just these red bumps that didn\u2019t itch at all, but then they grew larger, turning into painful ulcers that crusted over. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to keep my mind off it, but it\u2019s hard not to worry. I haven\u2019t had any fever or stomach pain, but the sight of these lesions is unsettling. I\u2019ve been with my partner since we got married at 24, and I can\u2019t help but feel anxious about what this could mean. \n\nWhen I finally went to see a doctor, they examined the sores and took a biopsy, which only added to my unease. I\u2019m just waiting for results, but the thought of what they might find keeps me up at night. I keep asking myself\u2014what\u2019s really going on with my body? Am I facing something serious?

My heart races at 99 beats per minute, and I\u2019m worried about what that means. \n\nThe doctors have mentioned something about diminished breath sounds and poor effort in breathing, which only adds to my anxiety. They\u2019ve checked my blood pressure, which is high, and my oxygen levels are hovering at 95%. I can\u2019t help but wonder what\u2019s happening to my body. The fact that they can feel my bladder during the examination makes me feel even more uneasy. \n\nI just want answers. What could be causing all of this?

I keep thinking about the last year\u2014I've been here seven times already with similar symptoms, and I can\u2019t help but wonder what\u2019s really going on with me.\n\nThe doctors checked my arm, but thankfully, there\u2019s no redness or swelling. Still, I feel this gnawing anxiety about what it all means. I just want answers. I don\u2019t know why I keep ending up here, and each time feels scarier than the last. What if there\u2019s something seriously wrong? I just wish I could find a way to feel better and stop this cycle of pain and worry.",

Was this something serious? Would it affect him later in life? The uncertainty was overwhelming. I just wanted to know what was wrong and how to fix it. As a parent, all I wanted was to protect him, and now I felt so helpless.",

I take my medications regularly\u2014aspirin, lisinopril, alendronate, calcium, venlafaxine, and vitamin D\u2014but none of it seems to be helping me now. I just want to understand why I felt this way and if I\u2019ll be okay.",

    "question": "A 37-year-old G1P1001 delivers a male infant at 9 pounds 6 ounces after a C-section for preeclampsia with severe features. The mother has a history of type II diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c of 12.8% at her first obstetric visit. Before this pregnancy, she was taking metformin, and during this pregnancy, she was started on insulin. At her routine visits, her glucose logs frequently showed fasting fingerstick glucoses above 120 mg/dL and postprandial values above 180 mg/dL. In addition, her routine third trimester culture for group B Streptococcus was positive. At 38 weeks and 4 days gestation, she was found to have a blood pressure of 176/103 mmHg and reported a severe headache during a routine obstetric visit. She denied rupture of membranes or vaginal bleeding. Her physician sent her to the obstetric triage unit, and after failure of several intravenous doses of labetalol to lower her blood pressure and relieve her headache, a C-section was performed without complication. Fetal heart rate tracing had been reassuring throughout her admission. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 7 and 10. After one hour, the infant is found to be jittery; the infant's temperature is 96.1\u00b0F (35.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 60/min. When the first feeding is attempted, he does not latch and begins to shake his arms and legs. After 20 seconds, the episode ends and the infant becomes lethargic.

    "transformed_question_worried": "I can hardly describe the whirlwind of emotions I felt during my pregnancy. At 37, I was already dealing with type II diabetes, but I never expected things to escalate like this. My A1c was alarmingly high when I first visited the doctor, and despite starting insulin during my pregnancy, my blood sugar levels were still troubling. I often checked my glucose, and it seemed like I was constantly battling numbers above what I knew was safe.\n\nThings took a turn at my routine visit when my blood pressure spiked to 176/103. I remember feeling that severe headache creeping in, and my heart sank when the doctor sent me to the triage unit. Despite several attempts to lower my blood pressure, I ended up needing a C-section. I was so scared, but the fetal heart monitor showed reassuring signs, and I held on to that hope.\n\nWhen my baby boy was born, he weighed a hefty 9 pounds 6 ounces. But shortly after, I noticed something was off. He felt jittery, and his temperature was low. The moment he struggled to latch during his first feeding, my heart dropped. It was terrifying to see him shaking and then suddenly become lethargic. I can\u2019t shake the worry from my mind\u2014what could be causing all of this? I just want my baby to be okay.",

My body feels like it\u2019s on fire with a temperature of 104\u00b0F. \n\nI\u2019ve been managing diabetes and hypertension for a while, taking insulin and metformin, along with lisinopril.

My heart races at 120 beats per minute, and even though my oxygen levels are fine, I can\u2019t help but feel like something is seriously wrong. \n\nThe doctors are examining me closely. They\u2019ve noticed that my eye looks different, bulging out in a way that\u2019s frightening. I can\u2019t move it properly, and there\u2019s a strange numbness around it that worries me more than I can express. \n\nAs I wait for a CT scan, I feel my energy slipping away.
