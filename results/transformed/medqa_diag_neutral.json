My current medications include enalapril for blood pressure, metformin and sitagliptin for diabetes, glargine and lispro for insulin management, and fenofibrate for my triglyceride levels.\n\nI have not smoked in over 35 years and only consume 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks during special occasions. During my visit, my blood pressure was recorded at 146/90 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute. My temperature was slightly elevated at 37.8\u00b0C.\n\nThe examination revealed that I appeared uncomfortable but alert. There was no jaundice evident in my sclera, and my neck was supple without tenderness. My abdomen was tender upon palpation in the epigastric region, and my liver was palpable along the costal margin. However, the Murphy's sign was negative.\n\nThese symptoms and findings led to further evaluation, although I do not have the results to share at this time.",

My other health concerns include hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. I typically have two glasses of wine with dinner most nights and I have a 30-pack-year smoking history.\n\nDuring the physical examination, the doctor noted that my eyes were icteric, and my abdomen was soft and non-distended, showing no tenderness. Bowel sounds were present, but no significant issues were detected during the exam. \n\nGiven my symptoms and medical history, I am awaiting further investigation, including abdominal imaging, to understand the cause of my condition.",

I smoke 2 to 3 cigarettes on weekends but do not consume alcohol. \n\nDuring my visit, my pulse was measured at 97 beats per minute, my blood pressure was 128/76 mm Hg, and my temperature was 36.7\u00b0C. The physical examination showed that I was well-developed overall, but there was mild gynecomastia. My heart rate and rhythm were regular, and the examination of my lungs revealed clear sounds with some occasional crepitations. \n\nHowever, I had a notable tenderness in my right testicle, which was larger than the left and did not transilluminate. It remained unchanged in size after I performed a Valsalva maneuver. Following some laboratory tests, I learned that I had elevated levels of beta-HCG. This series of symptoms and findings is concerning, and I understand that a diagnosis is being considered.",

Initially, I felt fine and was able to return to work within a few days. However, the accident had a profound impact on me beyond my physical injuries. I witnessed the death of a teenage girl in the crash, who was a friend of my sister's. \n\nAbout a month later, I noticed a shift in my mood. I became increasingly withdrawn and irritable. I began experiencing feelings of depression and anxiety that were more intense than usual. I often found myself feeling guilty about the girl's death, believing that if I had acted faster, I could have saved her. \n\nRecently, I experienced heightened anxiety while driving past another car accident on the freeway. Even while watching television or movies, I feel panic during scenes involving car crashes. These reactions have made me realize that the emotional effects of the accident are affecting my daily life. I am now seeking help to understand what I am going through and to find a way to cope with these feelings.",

I did not have any tenderness in my abdomen, but the doctor found that my liver was enlarged, extending 3 cm below the right rib cage, and my spleen was also enlarged, extending 2 cm below the left rib cage. \n\nAfter some tests were conducted, the findings suggested that my blood counts were notably abnormal, indicating low hemoglobin and platelet levels. A bone marrow aspirate was performed, which showed a predominance of immature cells that tested positive for specific markers. \n\nBased on these observations and the results, the physician indicated that a diagnosis would be made from this information.",

About four hours prior to my visit, I was out walking my dog when I suddenly experienced weakness in my left leg. There were no warning signs or prior symptoms; I simply found that I could not move my left leg as I normally would. This weakness persisted for roughly three hours before I began to feel normal again while I was in the car on my way to the hospital.\n\nAt the emergency department, I underwent a thorough physical and neurological examination, which did not reveal any abnormalities. I was able to move all my limbs without issue, exhibiting full strength in both my upper and lower extremities. My medical history includes a 20-year history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. During my assessment, my heart rate was measured at 80 beats per minute, my blood pressure was recorded at 148 over 92, and my respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute. I had a noncontrast CT scan of my head performed as part of the evaluation.",

During the physical examination, the physician noted tenderness in my right flank and observed edema in both of my legs, which extended up to my knees.\n\nTo further investigate my condition, a Doppler ultrasonography was performed. The results indicated that my right kidney was enlarged and echogenic, with an absent venous signal. Following these findings, my healthcare team began to assess the underlying cause of my condition. They noted the presence of protein in my urine and a significant number of red blood cells upon analysis.",

Additionally, I am aware that my father passed away at the age of 60 due to some form of abdominal cancer.

During the physical examination, I appeared disheveled and was oriented to my identity but not to the time or place. The neurologic examination revealed that I had nystagmus and severe gait ataxia. \n\nTo assess my condition further, a T1/T2 MRI was performed, which showed evidence of damage to my mammillary bodies. I received appropriate treatment, which helped me recover most of my cognitive functions. However, I continue to experience significant short-term memory deficits. I can still recall events from my past, including the schools and college I attended, my current job, and the names of my family members quite well. Despite these improvements, I struggle with new information and recent events.",

Upon arrival at the emergency department, my blood pressure was recorded at 136/92 mm Hg, my heart rate was 86 beats per minute, my respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and my temperature was normal at 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). \n\nA chest X-ray revealed a resolving opacity in my right middle lobe, suggesting some recent lung involvement. While I was in the examination room, I unexpectedly developed a spontaneous nosebleed. The medical team conducted initial laboratory tests, which indicated elevated levels of inflammatory markers, but I am not aware of the specific details. Overall, I felt concerned about my symptoms and their implications for my health.",

This improvement coincided with better staffing at the hospital and a more manageable workload, which has helped alleviate some of the stress I was experiencing. Overall, I feel much better now and am more capable of handling my responsibilities.",

Over the past several months, I have experienced significant fatigue and noticed an unintentional weight loss of about 20 pounds. During my visit, the doctor conducted some tests, and I learned that my creatinine levels had increased from my usual baseline. Additionally, my serum calcium level was measured at 11.5 mg/dL, which raised some concern.\n\nFollowing this, I was referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation of my kidney function. As part of my assessment, a renal biopsy was performed, and I was informed that the microscopic examination of my urine showed the presence of eosinophilic casts. I am awaiting further discussion with my healthcare team to understand the implications of these findings and the most likely explanations for my renal condition.",

Upon arrival, I felt pale and in moderate distress, experiencing a sharp pain in the back of my left shoulder. \n\nThe medical team began their assessment. My temperature was recorded at 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). They took my blood pressure in both arms; the right arm read 94/63 mm Hg and the left arm was 90/61 mm Hg. My pulse was elevated at 122 beats per minute, and my breathing rate was 24 breaths per minute. During the examination, the doctors noted that my heart sounds were normal and my lungs were clear. They also observed several large bruises on my chest and abdomen, consistent with a seatbelt pattern. \n\nMy abdomen was tender to touch, with some mild rebound tenderness and rigidity. However, my range of motion was normal, and I exhibited full motor strength in all my limbs, with no signs of wrist drop. A Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scan was ordered to further evaluate my condition.",

    "transformed_question_neutral": "I am a 31-year-old woman, currently in my 38th week of pregnancy and a first-time mother. I have a history of hypertension. This morning, while riding my bike to work, I fell and began to experience painful contractions. Shortly after the fall, I noticed some vaginal bleeding and felt lower abdominal and pelvic pain between the contractions.\n\nConcerned about my symptoms, I went to the emergency department, believing that I might be in labor. Upon arrival, my vital signs were taken: my temperature was 97.6\u00b0F, my blood pressure was notably high at 177/99 mmHg, my pulse was 100 beats per minute, my respirations were 20 per minute, and my oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.\n\nDuring the physical examination, the doctor noted that my uterus was gravid and hypertonic, and there was moderate blood present in the vaginal vault. An ultrasound was performed, but it did not reveal any abnormalities. Given these circumstances, I was left awaiting a diagnosis regarding my condition and the implications for my pregnancy.",
