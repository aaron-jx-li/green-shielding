During my time on the surgical floor, my family came to visit. However, when they learned about my diagnosis, there was a confrontation, and they left angrily. Following this incident, I expressed feelings of distress, stating that I felt like I had “the worst family in the world” and was reluctant to return home.

My oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. The medical team performed a primary and secondary survey, noting bruising along my chest wall on both sides. Initial imaging, including a pelvic radiograph and an electrocardiogram (ECG), did not show any abnormalities. However, a chest radiograph revealed a sternal fracture and several rib fractures. 

I was administered morphine for pain relief, which caused my heart rate to improve to 80 beats per minute. I remained under observation in the emergency department for the next six hours, during which my laboratory values and a repeat ECG returned to normal limits. 

Suddenly, I began to experience shortness of breath. At that time, my temperature was 99.5°F, blood pressure was 127/68 mmHg, my pulse was 120 beats per minute, and my respirations increased to 28 breaths per minute.

My medical history includes recurrent ear infections during childhood. Upon examination, my temperature was recorded at 99.0°F, and my vital signs showed a blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, a pulse of 72 beats per minute, and respirations at 14 per minute. I maintained an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.

During the physical exam, the doctor noted that my mouth was drooping downward on the left side, and I was unable to fully close my left eye.

During the physical examination, the doctor noted multiple bruises on my arms, legs, and abdomen, each showing different stages of healing. My right knee was swollen, red, and tender to the touch. The doctor performed a procedure called arthrocentesis, which involved drawing fluid from my knee, and the fluid was bloody. They observed about 1,000 white blood cells in the aspirate. 

The medical team conducted further tests. I learned that my bleeding time was 4 minutes, which is within the normal range, but my activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 67 seconds, significantly longer than the normal range of 30 to 40 seconds.

This discomfort has significantly impacted my daily activities; I can no longer brush my hair and have stopped attending my regular tennis lessons. I do not recall any incidents of falling or trauma that could have caused this issue. 

During the examination, I noticed that when my right arm is passively lifted in an arc, I feel pain between 60 and 120 degrees of abduction. Additionally, when asked to slowly lower my right arm from a position of 90 degrees of abduction, I found it difficult to hold my arm up, and it dropped to my side. 

The physician assessed my passive range of motion, which appeared normal.

I have also been a smoker for the past 35 years, averaging 20 to 30 cigarettes a day.

Upon arrival at the emergency department, my vital signs were recorded. My blood pressure was noted to be 149/85 mm Hg, and my temperature was 36.9°C (98.4°F). The medical staff observed that my pulse was irregular at a rate of 96 beats per minute. During the physical examination, they found that the pulses in my right popliteal and posterior tibial areas were absent. Additionally, my right leg appeared pale and felt cold to the touch.

I had not received any prenatal care prior to this visit. Upon arrival, I noticed I was having contractions, five in ten minutes, each lasting between 70 and 90 seconds. A pelvic examination revealed a closed cervix, and my uterus was consistent in size with a 38-week gestation. 

An ultrasound was conducted, showing that I had a single live intrauterine fetus in a breech presentation, estimated to be around 37 weeks gestation. The amniotic fluid index measured 26, and the fetal heart rate was recorded at 92 beats per minute. There was no evidence of placenta detachment. Due to the nonreassuring fetal heart rate, I was scheduled for an emergency lower segment transverse cesarean section.

After the procedure, my infant was delivered, and the APGAR score was noted to be 8 at one minute.
