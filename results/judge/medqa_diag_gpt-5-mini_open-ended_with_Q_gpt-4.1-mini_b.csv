Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6–24.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8–3.1). What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely diagnosis: exogenous insulin administration (factitious hypoglycemia — probable caregiver-administered insulin / Munchausen by proxy).

Reasoning: Marked hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with suppressed C‑peptide indicates injected (exogenous) insulin. Sulfonylurea ingestion would raise C‑peptide. Insulin-mediated hypokalemia (low K+) supports the diagnosis, and the mother’s diabetes raises concern for caregiver‑inflicted hypoglycemia.","Factitious disorder imposed on another

She is oriented to time, place, and person. Her temperature is 37°C (98.7°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Examination shows drooping of the left side of the face. Her speech is clear. Examination shows full muscle strength. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. A finger-nose test and her gait are normal. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a right-sided carotid bruit. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within the reference ranges. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. A noncontrast CT scan of the brain shows no abnormalities. On the way back from the CT scan, her presenting symptoms resolve. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely a transient ischemic attack (TIA), likely from atherosclerotic disease of the right carotid artery (right carotid bruit with transient left facial numbness/weakness that resolved within 30 minutes).",Transient ischemic attack,True,CORRECT
"A 44-year-old man presents to the family medicine clinic for some small bumps on his left thigh. The lesions are non-pruritic and have been present for the last 3 weeks. He reports feeling fatigued and malaise for the past few months. The patient has no known medical problems and takes no medications. He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and uses intravenous street drugs. His heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, the temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), and the blood pressure is 126/80 mm Hg. Auscultation of the heart is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Three 2-3 mm, dome-shaped, hardened papules are noted on the left thigh. Central umbilication can be observed in each papule. There is a non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy present. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Molluscum contagiosum (poxvirus) — classically dome-shaped, umbilicated papules. In an adult IV drug user with systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy, this should prompt evaluation for underlying immunosuppression (eg, HIV).",Molluscum contagiosum,False,WRONG
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of severe back pain that began when he was lifting a box 1 hour ago. He also has a 2-year history of increasingly severe right hip pain. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation of the lower spine as well as erythema of the skin over the right hip. Neurologic examination shows decreased hearing in the left ear; the Weber test localizes to the left side. Serum studies show an alkaline phosphatase concentration of 410 U/L, calcium concentration of 9.5 mg/dL, and parathyroid hormone level of 322 pg/mL. An x-ray of the spine shows a fracture of the L4 vertebra. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans).

Reasoning: Elderly patient with chronic focal bone pain (hip), localized warmth/erythema from increased vascularity, elevated alkaline phosphatase with normal serum calcium, conductive hearing loss from skull involvement, and pathologic vertebral fracture after minor trauma — all classic for Paget disease.",Osteitis deformans,True,CORRECT
"A 63-year-old African American man presents to the emergency department with edema over his face and difficulty breathing. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia. He recently began lisinopril and atorvastatin several weeks ago. His father died at 80 years from complications of a stroke and his mother lives in a nursing home. His blood pressure is 135/92 mm Hg, the heart rate is 101/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, the temperature is 32.0°C (98.6°F). Clinical pathology results suggest a normal C1 esterase inhibitor level. Of the following options, which is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely diagnosis: ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema from lisinopril (bradykinin-mediated). 

Rationale: facial edema and airway symptoms began weeks after starting an ACE inhibitor, African Americans are at higher risk, and normal C1 esterase inhibitor makes hereditary angioedema unlikely. 

Immediate management: stop the ACE inhibitor, secure the airway as needed, and consider bradykinin-targeted therapy (icatibant) or FFP if severe; antihistamines/steroids/epinephrine are often ineffective for bradykinin-mediated angioedema.",Drug-induced angioedema,True,CORRECT

Doppler ultrasonography shows an enlarged, echogenic right kidney with the absent venous signal. Laboratory results are shown:
Serum creatinine 2.2 mg/dL
Urine dipstick 4+ protein
Urine analysis 20–25 red cells/high power field
What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's condition?","This is renal vein thrombosis due to a hypercoagulable state from nephrotic syndrome — most likely membranous nephropathy in an adult. Urinary loss of anticoagulant proteins (eg, antithrombin III) predisposes to thrombosis.",Membranous nephropathy,True,CORRECT
"A 26-year-old primigravid woman comes to the emergency department because of a 10-hour history of vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. She also had nausea and fatigue for the past 4 weeks. Her last menstrual period was 9 weeks ago. There is no history of medical illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 9-week gestation. A urine pregnancy test is positive. β-HCG level is 108,000 mIU/mL (N < 5 mIU/mL). Transvaginal ultrasonography shows unclear, amorphous fetal parts and a large placenta with multiple cystic spaces. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?","A partial hydatidiform mole due to dispermic fertilization of a normal ovum, producing a triploid conceptus (typically 69,XXY) with abnormal trophoblastic proliferation and cystic (hydropic) placental villi.",Partial molar pregnancy,False,WRONG
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fatigue. He reports that during this time he has had occasional palpitations and shortness of breath.

Intravenous fluids are started and labs are sent. A urinary ß-hCG has been ordered. What is most likely the diagnosis?","Ruptured hepatic (liver) adenoma with intraperitoneal hemorrhage.  

Rationale: Young woman on OCPs (and likely anabolic steroid use suggested by virilization — acne, broad shoulders/thick neck after weight loss for a fitness show) presenting with sudden severe RUQ pain and hypotension is classic for hemorrhage from a hepatic adenoma. A urine β-hCG was being checked to exclude pregnancy/ruptured ectopic, but the RUQ location and virilizing history point to ruptured hepatic adenoma.",Vascular ectasia within the liver,False,WRONG
"A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with back pain. He states that it started yesterday and has been gradually getting worse. He states that the pain is worsened with moving and lifting and is relieved with rest and ibuprofen. He has a past medical history of smoking and IV drug abuse and states he last used IV drugs 2 days ago. He thinks his symptoms may be related to lifting a heavy box. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 122/88 mmHg, pulse is 77/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for focal back pain lateral to the patient’s spine on the left. There is no midline tenderness and the rest of the patient’s exam is unremarkable. There are scars in the antecubital fossae bilaterally. Laboratory values including a C-reactive protein are unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Acute paraspinal (lumbar) muscle strain.  
Focal, lateral back pain worsened by movement/ lifting and relieved by rest/NSAIDs, with normal vitals and inflammatory markers and no midline spinal tenderness or neurologic signs, is most consistent with a musculoskeletal strain rather than vertebral osteomyelitis or epidural abscess.",Muscle strain,False,WRONG
"A 25-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hematemesis and shock. Five days ago she had a severe fever 40.0℃ (104.0℉), retro-orbital pain, nausea, and myalgias. The high temperatures decreased over a few days, but she developed severe abdominal pain and bleeding gums. A single episode of hematemesis occurred prior to ICU admission.

The patient is given dihydroergotamine, IV fluids, and is started on 100% oxygen. Two hours later, the patient demonstrates slurring of her speech. On physical exam there is drooping of the left side of her mouth, and her left upper extremity demonstrates 2/5 strength. A head CT is ordered. What is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation?",An acute ischemic stroke from cerebral vasospasm due to the additive vasoconstrictive interaction of sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine (ergot + triptan use — contraindicated within 24 hrs).,Medication reaction,True,CORRECT
"A 27-year-old man is brought into the emergency department by ambulance. The patient was at an appointment to receive welfare when he began acting abnormally. The patient was denied welfare. Shortly afterwards, he no longer responded to questions and stared blankly off into space, not responding to verbal stimuli. Other than odd lip-smacking behavior, he was motionless. Several minutes later, he became responsive but seemed confused. The patient has a past medical history of drug abuse and homelessness and is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 124/78 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with 5/5 strength in the upper and lower extremities and a stable gait. The patient seems confused when answering questions and has trouble remembering the episode. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely a focal seizure with impaired awareness (complex partial seizure), likely temporal-lobe in origin. The brief unresponsiveness with automatisms (lip-smacking), followed by a confused, amnestic postictal state, is classic for a complex partial seizure.",Complex partial seizure,True,CORRECT
"A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police. The patient was found intoxicated at a local bar. The patient is combative and smells of alcohol. The patient has a past medical history of alcoholism, IV drug use, and schizophrenia. His current medications include IM haloperidol and ibuprofen. The patient is currently homeless and has presented to the emergency department similarly multiple times. His temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 130/87 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Physical exam is deferred due to patient non-compliance. Laboratory values reveal an acute kidney injury and a normal PT/PTT. The patient is started on IV fluids and ketorolac to control symptoms of a headache. The patient begins to vomit into a basin.

What best describes the most likely diagnosis?","Mallory-Weiss tear — a nontransmural (mucosal) longitudinal laceration at the gastroesophageal junction from forceful retching/vomiting (classically in alcoholics), causing upper GI bleeding/hematemesis; usually self-limited (contrast with Boerhaave, a transmural esophageal rupture with severe chest pain and mediastinal emphysema).",Mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction,True,CORRECT
"A 19-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance 30 minutes after her neighbor found her unconscious on a running trail. Her neighbor reports that she has been training for a marathon since the beginning of the summer. She is alert and oriented but becomes irritable when realizing that she is at a hospital and refuses to answer questions. She appears tired. She is 174 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 51 kg (112 lb). Her temperature is 35.5°C (96°F), pulse is 44/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 84/48 mm Hg. Examination shows dry, scaly skin and dry mucous membranes. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a high-frequency, mid-to-late systolic murmur that is heard best at the apex. Her hemoglobin concentration is 11.9 g/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Anorexia nervosa (likely the restricting type).  

Rationale: young, markedly underweight woman with hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension and dry, scaly skin — classic physiologic sequelae of severe caloric restriction. The high‑frequency mid/late systolic murmur at the apex is consistent with mitral valve prolapse, which is commonly seen in patients with anorexia. The syncope/altered behavior likely reflects hemodynamic instability/electrolyte disturbances from the eating disorder.",Anorexia nervosa,True,CORRECT
"A 5-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a rash. The patient’s parents state that he has been more ill lately. They report that he recently developed a rash on his head that now seems to be spreading to the rest of his body. His symptoms started 3 days ago and have considerably worsened since then. The patient is otherwise healthy. He has not seen a pediatrician nor has he attended general checkup or milestone appointments.

"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being stabbed 12 times in various parts of his body. Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found. Due to his Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, an endotracheal airway and large-bore access are secured prior to arrival. He is aggressively resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol as the operating room is prepared for an exploratory laparotomy. An arterial line and central access are obtained. His temperature is 95°F (35°C), blood pressure is 50/40 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min, and respirations are controlled at 20/min on lung-protective volume control. After a 6:6:1 ratio of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion, the patient's vital signs remain the same. The surgical team reports no active blood loss. A stat ScvO2 results as 39% with a SaO2 of 100% on 100% oxygen. His extremities remain cold despite having the ambient room temperature increased to 80°F (26.7°C). What is the most likely cause of his presentation?","Citrate toxicity from the massive transfusion causing hypocalcemia → acute myocardial depression (low cardiac output) and refractory hypotension. Citrate from stored blood chelates calcium (worse with hypothermia/impaired liver perfusion), producing poor perfusion (cold extremities) and very low ScvO2 despite normal SaO2. Treat with IV calcium (gluconate or chloride).",Cardiac tamponade,False,WRONG
"A previously healthy 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother because of persistent crying and refusal to move his right arm. The episode began 30 minutes ago after the mother lifted him up by the arms. He appears distressed and is inconsolable. On examination, his right arm is held close to his body in a flexed and pronated position. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Nursemaid's elbow (radial head subluxation) — subluxation of the radial head after axial traction on an outstretched/pronated arm. Classic in toddlers: arm held slightly flexed and pronated, refuses to use it. Reduced with gentle supination and flexion (or hyperpronation) of the forearm, usually with immediate improvement.",Radial head subluxation,True,CORRECT
"A 33-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. She was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head on collision at 25 miles per hour. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 129/66 mmHg, pulse is 127/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The primary and secondary survey are performed and are only notable for bruising along her chest wall bilaterally. An initial pelvic radiograph, an electrocardiogram (ECG) are performed and are unremarkable. A chest radiograph is performed and is notable for a sternal fracture and several rib fractures. The patient is given morphine and her heart rate subsequently improves to 80/min.

"A 63-year-old African American man with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia presents to the emergency department with facial swelling and difficulty breathing. Symptoms began suddenly that morning and continued to worsen. He started taking lisinopril several weeks ago. His blood pressure is 110/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 94/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min. Physical examination is notable for swelling of his lips and inspiratory stridor. Clinical lab results suggest a normal C1 esterase inhibitor level. Of the following options, which is the most likely diagnosis?","ACE inhibitor–related (bradykinin-mediated) angioedema from lisinopril.  

Rationale: sudden lip/facial swelling with airway compromise after starting an ACE inhibitor, African‑American race increases risk, and normal C1 esterase inhibitor makes hereditary angioedema unlikely.

A peripheral blood smear reveals RBCs with Howell-Jolly bodies. Rapid detumescence is achieved after aspiration of blood and administration of an adrenergic agonist and analgesia. What etiologies should be considered in this patient?","The cavernous blood gas (low pO2, high pCO2, acidemia) shows ischemic (low‑flow) priapism. In a 12‑year‑old African‑American boy with anemia and Howell‑Jolly bodies (functional asplenia/autosplenectomy), the leading etiology is sickle cell disease (HbSS or other sickling variants) causing vaso‑occlusion of the corpora. 

Other etiologies to consider:
- Other hematologic disorders (acute leukemia, thalassemia, hyperviscosity syndromes)
- Hypercoagulable states
- Drug‑induced priapism (eg, trazodone, some antipsychotics, alpha‑blockers)
- Rarely pelvic/genitourinary malignancy or trauma (more commonly causes non‑ischemic/high‑flow priapism)

"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for the evaluation of abdominal pain and trouble sleeping for the past 6 months. His mother says he complains of crampy abdominal pain every morning on school days. He started attending a new school 7 months ago and she is concerned because he has missed school frequently due to the abdominal pain. He also has trouble falling asleep at night and asks to sleep in the same room with his parents every night. He has not had fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss. He sits very close to his mother and starts to cry when she steps out of the room to take a phone call. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Separation anxiety disorder.

He has excessive fear of being apart from his mother (clinginess, crying when she leaves, insists on sleeping with parents), somatic symptoms (morning abdominal pain) and school refusal that began with a new school ~7 months ago, with normal exam — meeting the duration and symptom pattern for separation anxiety.",Separation anxiety disorder,True,CORRECT
"A 23-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her boyfriend because of a 4-month history of feeling sad. Her boyfriend says that, during this period, she has slept and eaten very little and has been unable to focus at work.

She does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, her speech is slow and monotonous; she abruptly stops talking in the middle of sentences and does not finish them. She occasionally directs her attention to the ceiling as if she were listening to someone. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Schizophrenia.

She has psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations, disorganized speech/thought blocking, negative features) present for about 7 months (exceeding the 6-month cutoff). The depressive symptoms began later (4 months) and do not constitute the majority of the illness, which rules out major depressive disorder with psychotic features and schizoaffective disorder.",Schizoaffective disorder,True,CORRECT
"A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department with his wife because of a 3-day history of severe pain in his right arm. He also reports that he cannot move his right arm. The symptoms began after the patient woke up one morning, having slept on his side. He is otherwise healthy. He works as a waiter and says that he feels exhausted from working several night shifts per week. He adds that he “can barely keep his eyes open” when looking after their daughter the next day. Since the onset of the pain, he has been unable to work and is fully dependent on his wife, who took an extra shift to make enough money to pay their monthly bills. The patient appears relaxed but only allows himself to be examined after his wife convinces him. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows 1/5 muscle strength in the right arm. Reflexes are normal. He has no sensation to light touch over the entire right arm and forearm. When a pin prick test is conducted, the patient rapidly withdraws the right arm. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder).

Reasoning: The exam shows nonanatomic, internally inconsistent findings (global light-touch loss of the limb with preserved pain perception shown by rapid withdrawal; normal reflexes) plus a seeming lack of appropriate concern (la belle indifference) and recent stress/exhaustion. These features are classic for conversion disorder rather than an organic neuropathy or intentional feigning (malingering).",Malingering,True,CORRECT
"A 51-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. She is unconscious and was intubated in the field. Past medical history is unknown.

There is no evidence of head trauma, she withdraws to pain and her pupils are 2mm and reactive to light. Her heart has a regular rhythm without any murmurs or rubs and her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her abdomen is firm and distended with decreased bowel sounds. Her extremities are cool and clammy with weak, thready pulses. There is no peripheral edema. Of the following, what is the likely cause of her presentation?","Hypovolemic (hemorrhagic) shock from intra‑abdominal bleeding — most likely a splenic laceration from the crash. 

Reason: hypotension, tachycardia, cool clammy extremities and thready pulses indicate low circulating volume/vasoconstriction. A firm, distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds suggests intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Normal heart/lung exam and absence of JVD make cardiogenic or obstructive causes less likely.",Hypovolemic shock,True,CORRECT
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with her boyfriend 2 hours after an episode of loss of consciousness. She was seated and was being tattooed on her right upper flank when she became diaphoretic, pale, and passed out.

Her past medical history includes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which has been difficult to manage medically. Vital signs include a blood pressure of 100/70 mm Hg, temperature of 37.1°C (98.8 °F), and pulse of 95/min. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in severe pain, and there is mild diffuse abdominal tenderness. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Chronic mesenteric ischemia (intestinal angina) due to mesenteric vasculitis from SLE. 

Rationale: postprandial abdominal pain with food avoidance and weight loss, intermittent bloody diarrhea, and underlying vasculitic disease (SLE) point to mesenteric ischemia from compromised intestinal blood flow.",Ischemic bowel disease,True,CORRECT
"A 51-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of an aggressive cough with copious amounts of thick, foamy, yellow-green sputum. She says she has had this cough for about 11 years with exacerbations similar to her presentation today. She also reports that her cough is worse in the morning. She was evaluated multiple times in the past because of recurrent bouts of bronchitis that have required treatment with antibiotics. She is a non-smoker. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 125/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 80/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). Chest auscultation reveals crackles and wheezing over the right middle lobe and the rest of her physical examinations are normal. The chest X-ray shows irregular opacities in the right middle lobe and diffuse airway thickening. Based on this history and physical examination, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","Bronchiectasis.

Rationale: chronic (years) productive cough with copious purulent sputum, recurrent infectious exacerbations, morning prominence, focal crackles/wheeze and localized radiographic opacities/airway thickening are classic for bronchiectasis (bronchial dilation from chronic infection/inflammation). Chronic bronchitis is less likely in a lifelong non‑smoker and usually produces more diffuse findings.",Bronchiectasis,True,CORRECT
"A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency room due to shortness of breath that started an hour ago while playing football with some friends. He has had similar episodes in the past when he also had to be rushed to the hospital. Physical examination shows body temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse rate is 100/min, respiratory rate is 28/min and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Also, it shows decreased breath sounds on both sides, the peak expiratory flow rate is 200 L/min and SpO2 is 89% on room air. The man is given an initial treatment with nebulization using an inhaled short-acting β-agonist. An arterial blood gas analysis shows the following:
pH 7.48
PaO2 59 mm Hg
PaCO2 26 mm Hg
HCO3- 26 mEq/L
After administering oxygen by mask, the man’s PaO2 increases to 75 mm Hg. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?","An acute asthma exacerbation (bronchospasm/airway obstruction) causing a ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.  

Rationale: the ABG shows hypoxemia with an increased A–a gradient and respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation; PaO2 improves with supplemental O2 (argues against a true shunt), consistent with V/Q mismatch from bronchoconstriction.",Asthma attack,True,CORRECT
"A 70-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of severe fatigue. Over the past month, she has unintentionally lost 2 kg (4.4 lb). Three years ago, she was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. Currently, she takes no medications other than aspirin for occasional knee pain. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within the normal range. On physical examination, her conjunctivae are pale. Petechiae are present on the distal lower extremities and on the soft and hard palates. Palpation reveals bilateral painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Examination of the lungs, heart, and abdomen shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 90 μm3
Leukocyte count 3000/mm3
Platelet count 20,000/mm3
A Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smear is shown in the image. What best explains these findings?","Progression of her myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myelogenous leukemia with marrow replacement by malignant myeloblasts (blasts with Auer rods on the peripheral smear). Neoplastic myeloblast accumulation causes ineffective hematopoiesis and resultant anemia, neutropenia and severe thrombocytopenia.",Acute myeloid leukemia,True,CORRECT
"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 3 hours after having a 2-minute episode of violent, jerky movements of his right arm at school. He was sweating profusely during the episode and did not lose consciousness. He remembers having felt a chill down his spine before the episode. Following the episode, he experienced weakness in the right arm and was not able to lift it above his head for 2 hours. Three weeks ago, he had a sore throat that resolved with over-the-counter medication. He was born at term and his mother remembers him having an episode of jerky movements when he had a high-grade fever as a toddler. There is no family history of serious illness, although his father passed away in a motor vehicle accident approximately 1 year ago. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 94/54 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of glucose, electrolytes, calcium, and creatinine are within the reference range. What is the most likely diagnosis?","A focal (partial) motor seizure (simple partial/focal aware) affecting the left motor cortex with transient postictal (Todd) paralysis of the right arm. 

Reason: a distinct sensory aura, brief localized clonic movements with preserved consciousness, and a transient focal weakness afterwards (Todd paralysis) are classic for a focal epileptic seizure; normal labs and exam make non-epileptic causes less likely.",Focal seizure,True,CORRECT
"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with increasing crampy abdominal pain and swelling over the past 2 days. He has not passed stool or flatus for over 12 hours. He has vomited twice. He has noted a lower stool caliber over the past month. His past medical history is unremarkable except for an appendectomy 8 years ago. He takes no medications. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows symmetric distension, active bowel sounds, and generalized tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. His leukocyte count is 10,000/mm3. An upright and supine X-ray of the abdomen are shown. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s recent condition?",A constricting (annular) adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon causing progressive luminal narrowing and acute large‑bowel obstruction.,Sigmoid tumor,False,WRONG
"A 60-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police officers because he was acting strangely in public. The patient was found talking nonsensically to characters on cereal boxes in the store. Past medical history is significant for multiple hospitalizations for alcohol-related injuries and seizures. The patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a disheveled male who is oriented to person, but not time or place. Neurologic examination shows nystagmus and severe gait ataxia. A T1/T2 MRI is performed and demonstrates evidence of damage to the mammillary bodies. The patient is given the appropriate treatment for recovering most of his cognitive functions. However, significant short-term memory deficits persist. The patient remembers events from his past such as the school and college he attended, his current job, and the names of family members quite well. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Korsakoff syndrome (Wernicke-Korsakoff) — chronic thiamine deficiency from alcoholism causing mammillary body damage, producing persistent anterograde (short-term) memory loss with relatively preserved remote memory.",Korsakoff's syndrome,True,CORRECT
"Four days after having been admitted to the hospital for a pulmonary contusion and whiplash injury sustained in a motor vehicle collision, a 66-year-old woman complains of severe pain in her right flank and muscle spasms. She also has nausea with two episodes of vomiting and abdominal bloating. Her pain had previously been well controlled with acetaminophen every 6 hours. She underwent umbilical hernia repair surgery two years ago. She takes sertraline for depression. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 99/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 102/72 mm Hg. After administration of 0.5 L of crystalloid fluids, blood pressure improves to 118/79 mm Hg. Multiple ecchymoses are present over the anterior abdominal wall in a pattern that follows the course of a seatbelt. There are ecchymoses of the flanks bilaterally. Bowel sounds are absent. There is tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants with voluntary guarding. Her hemoglobin is 7.9 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,500/mm3, platelet count is 350,000/mm3, prothrombin time is 11 seconds, and activated partial thromboplastin time is 33 seconds. An x-ray of the abdomen shows obliteration of the right psoas shadow and uniform distribution of gas in the small bowel, colon, and rectum without air-fluid levels. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?","A retroperitoneal hemorrhage (psoas/renal hematoma) from the blunt abdominal trauma. The seatbelt/flank ecchymoses, obliteration of the right psoas shadow, a drop in hemoglobin, flank pain with psoas spasm and paralytic ileus all point to a delayed retroperitoneal bleed (eg, renal or psoas muscle injury).",Retroperitoneal hemorrhage,True,CORRECT
"A 30-year-old man who was recently placed on TMP-SMX for a urinary tract infection presents to urgent care with a new rash. The vital signs include: blood pressure 121/80 mm Hg, pulse 91/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.2°F). Physical examination reveals a desquamative skin covering both of his lower extremities. A basic chemistry panel reveal sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 47, blood urea nitrogen 23 mg/dL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, and glucose 103 mg/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) — a sulfonamide-induced severe mucocutaneous reaction. Both lower extremities ≈36% body surface area (>30% → TEN rather than SJS).,Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN),False,WRONG
"A 17-year-old girl is admitted to the emergency department with severe retrosternal chest pain. The pain began suddenly after an episode of self-induced vomiting following a large meal. The patient’s parents say that she is very restricted in the foods she eats and induces vomiting frequently after meals. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 37.9℃ (100.2℉). The patient is pale and in severe distress. Lungs are clear to auscultation. On cardiac examination, a crunching, raspy sound is auscultated over the precordium that is synchronous with the heartbeat. The abdomen is soft and nontender. What tests would most likely confirm the diagnosis in this patient?","This presentation suggests Boerhaave syndrome (esophageal rupture with pneumomediastinum — Hamman’s sign). Confirm with imaging: an upright chest X-ray (may show mediastinal air/pleural effusion) and a water‑soluble contrast esophagogram (Gastrografin swallow) to demonstrate extravasation. If needed, CT chest with oral contrast can more sensitively localize the leak. Endoscopy is not the initial test.",Contrast esophagram,True,CORRECT
"A 47-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of urinary and fecal incontinence for 6 hours. Earlier in the day, he suffered a fall at a construction site and sustained injuries to his back and thighs but did not seek medical attention. He took ibuprofen for lower back pain. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg. Examination shows tenderness over the lumbar spine, bilateral lower extremity weakness, absent ankle jerk reflexes, and preserved patellar reflexes. There is decreased rectal tone. An ultrasound of the bladder shows a full bladder. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Cauda equina syndrome from acute compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots (eg, traumatic lumbar spine injury). The LMN signs (absent ankle reflexes with preserved patellar reflexes), urinary retention with decreased rectal tone and fecal incontinence are classic — urgent neurosurgical decompression is required.",Conus medullaris syndrome,False,WRONG
A 22-year-old female software analyst presents to a medical clinic for evaluation of tingling and numbness in both hands for the past 2 months. Her symptoms are usually aggravated by the end of the work day and absent on most off days. She has been a type I diabetic for 2 years and is currently on insulin. She admits to being sexually active but has had irregular periods for the past 3 months. A urine pregnancy test is negative. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?,Most likely carpal tunnel syndrome — repetitive wrist use (typing) causing compression of the median nerve at the wrist (tenosynovial thickening/transverse carpal ligament compression). Her diabetes predisposes to entrapment neuropathies; the workday‑dependent symptoms fit overuse/entrapment rather than diabetic polyneuropathy.,Hypothyroidism,False,WRONG
"A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department for eye pain. The patient states that he has had left eye pain for the past week that has been steadily worsening. The patient denies any changes to his vision, trouble moving his left eye, or recent trauma. The patient smokes one pack of cigarettes a day, drinks alcohol socially, and has had unprotected sex with two males and four females this past month. His current medications include loratadine, nasal saline spray, and diphenhydramine. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note a healthy young man. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. His physical exam reveals the finding in Figure A. What is the most likely diagnosis?","The most likely diagnosis is adult (inclusion) conjunctivitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis. 

Rationale: subacute unilateral eye pain in a sexually active adolescent with the exam finding of palpebral follicles (typical for chlamydial conjunctivitis) and relevant high-risk sexual history.",Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct,False,WRONG
A 17-year-old rugby player limped into the emergency room and says he “rolled his ankle” while running during a game. You conclude that the mechanism involved ankle plantar flexion and inversion. There is no medial or lateral malleolus point tenderness. Anterior drawer test of the ankle is positive. Talar tilt test is negative. What is the most likely injury?,An isolated lateral ankle sprain — rupture of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL). The plantarflexion/inversion mechanism and positive anterior drawer with a negative talar tilt point to ATFL injury (no malleolar fracture).,Anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) sprain,True,CORRECT
"ِA 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of colicky pain in the lower abdomen and abdominal distension for the past 12 hours.

"A 45-year-old woman repetitively visits the general surgery clinic worried that her inguinal hernia is incarcerated. 2 months ago, she was seen in the emergency department where she presented with a left lower abdominal swelling. The mass was easily reduced and the patient was referred to the general surgery clinic for elective surgical repair. Because her condition was deemed not urgent, she was informed that she was down on the surgical waiting list. Despite this, she continues to visit the clinic and the ED worried that her bowels are ‘trapped and dying.’ Each time she is reassured and any protrusion present is quickly reduced. She has previously frequently visited her primary care physician for complaints of abdominal pain and inconsistent bowel habits, but no etiology could be identified. She continues to intermittently have these symptoms and spends hours every day worrying about what may be going on. She has no other significant past medical history. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?","Somatic symptom disorder. 

She has real somatic complaints (hernia, abdominal/ bowel symptoms) but excessive worry and health‑related behaviors (repeated ED/clinic visits, hours/day worrying, persistent concern despite reassurance), consistent with somatic symptom disorder rather than illness‑anxiety disorder.",Somatic symptom disorder,False,WRONG
"A 72-year-old man who was involved in a traffic collision is brought to the emergency room by the ambulance service. He was in shock and comatose at the time of presentation. On examination, the heart rate is 60/min, and the blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. The patient dies, despite resuscitative efforts. Autopsy reveals multiple internal hemorrhages and other evidence of ischemic damage affecting the lungs, kidneys, and brain. The patient’s heart shows evidence of gross anomaly similar to the picture. While acute hypovolemia is the likely cause of the ischemic changes seen in the lungs, kidneys, and brain, which of the following best explains the gross anomaly of his heart?","The myocardial lesion most likely represents contraction‑band (catecholamine) necrosis caused by a massive adrenergic surge (and reperfusion/CPR). Intense sympathetic stimulation → Ca2+ overload and hypercontraction of myofibers with sarcolemmal rupture → focal hemorrhagic, hypercontracted (contraction‑band) lesions.",Senile calcific aortic stenosis,False,WRONG
"A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife because he has been acting confused for the past day. He is febrile, with an oral temperature of 103.6 deg F; vital signs are otherwise stable.

"A 60-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to progressive shortness of breath and a dry cough for the past week. She notes that her symptoms are exacerbated by physical activity and relieved by rest. The woman was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease 2 years ago and was recently started on regular dialysis treatment. Her pulse rate is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 30/min, and temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F). On examination of the respiratory system, there is dullness on percussion, decreased vocal tactile fremitus, and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The rest of the physical exam is within normal limits. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?","Findings are most consistent with a pleural effusion — dullness to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus and breath sounds at the right base. In a patient with chronic kidney disease on dialysis the most likely cause is volume overload/uremic fluid accumulation producing a transudative pleural effusion (can be worsened by inadequate dialysis).",Pleural effusion,True,CORRECT
"A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother for a follow-up examination. She has a history of recurrent asthma attacks.

The patient reports that she is unable to brush her hair and has stopped going to her regular tennis lessons because of the pain. She does not recall any fall or trauma. When her right arm is passively abducted in an arc, there is pain between 60 and 120 degrees of abduction. When asked to lower the right arm slowly from 90 degrees of abduction, she is unable to hold her arm up and it drops to her side. Passive range of motion is normal. Injection of 5 mL of 1% lidocaine into the right subacromial space does not relieve the pain or improve active range of motion of the right arm. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Full-thickness rotator cuff tear — most likely a supraspinatus tendon tear. 

Reason: painful arc (60–120°), positive drop-arm sign (can't slowly lower/hold at 90°), normal passive ROM (rules out adhesive capsulitis), and subacromial lidocaine not restoring active strength (injection relieves impingement pain but not a tendon rupture).",Rotator cuff tear,True,CORRECT
"A 67-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of decreased vision and black spots in front of his left eye for the past 24 hours. He states that it feels as if 'a curtain is hanging over his eye.' He sees flashes of light intermittently. He has no pain or diplopia. He underwent cataract surgery on the left eye 2 weeks ago.

The patient is deeply cyanosed despite a good respiratory effort and a clear airway. His lungs are clear to auscultation, bilaterally. Even though an endotracheal tube is introduced and assisted ventilation is induced, his condition does not improve. A review of dental records reveals the details of the procedure where the local anesthetic pilocarpine was administered. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?","Most likely methemoglobinemia from the local anesthetic (eg, prilocaine/benzocaine) used during the dental procedure. Oxidation of hemoglobin iron from Fe2+ to Fe3+ (methemoglobin) prevents O2 binding/delivery, produces cyanosis and an SpO2 ≈85% that does not correct with oxygen or ventilation.",Methemoglobinemia,True,CORRECT
"A 32-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of increasing lethargy, frequent upper respiratory tract infections, and easy bruising. Past medical history is unremarkable.

What cold-associated injuries does the patient have?","He has hypothermia (core 30.0°C — moderate hypothermia) plus frostbite of the hands and feet. The clear fluid-filled blisters, yellow/waxy skin and edema are characteristic of superficial (second‑degree) frostbite (deep frostbite would produce hemorrhagic blisters, eschar and gangrene).",Frostbite,True,CORRECT
"A 35-year-old is brought into the emergency room after a bicycle vs motored vehicle accident. He was unconscious after hitting the side of his head on the road, but recovered consciousness after a few minutes. He started to ride his bicycle again, but then developed a severe headache with nausea and vomiting, at which time he called EMS. While in the hospital, the patient is confused and cannot provide a history. He quickly loses consciousness and his CT scan is displayed in Figure 1. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Acute epidural hematoma (lens‑shaped, extra‑axial bleed — classically from middle meningeal artery rupture with a lucid interval followed by rapid deterioration).",Epidural hematoma,False,WRONG
"An 11-year-old girl is brought into the clinic by her parents, who are distraught over her behavior. They state that over the past several months she has started to act oddly, combing the hair of her toy dolls for hours without stopping and repetitively counting her steps in the house. She is often brought to tears when confronted about these behaviors. The patient has no past medical history. When questioned about family history, the mother states she has needed close medical follow-up in the past, but declines to elaborate. The patient's vital signs are all within normal limits. On physical exam the patient is a well nourished 11-year-old girl in no acute distress. She has occasional motor tics, but the remainder of the exam is benign. What is the diagnosis in this patient?","Obsessive–compulsive disorder (childhood-onset OCD) — she has time-consuming, distressing compulsions (repetitive counting, prolonged hair‑combing) with associated motor tics (common comorbidity). This is not Tourette syndrome (no vocal tics/multiple motor tics/history ≥1 year).",Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),True,CORRECT
"A 30-year-old man who recently emigrated from Southeast Asia presents with heartburn and a bad taste in his mouth. He says the symptoms have been present for the last 6 months and are much worse at night. He describes the pain as moderate to severe, burning in character, and localized to the epigastric region. He mentions that 1 month ago, he was tested for Helicobacter pylori back in his country and completed a course of multiple antibiotics, but there has been no improvement in his symptoms. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Most likely diagnosis: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with reflux esophagitis. 

Reason: chronic heartburn and acidic/bad taste (regurgitation), worse at night when supine, are classic for acid reflux; these features are not expected to improve after H. pylori eradication.",Gastroesophageal reflux disease,True,CORRECT
"A 51-year-old man presents to the emergency department with an episode of syncope. He was at a local farmer's market when he fainted while picking produce. He rapidly returned to his baseline mental status and did not hit his head. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension but is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 173/101 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for clear breath sounds and a S4 heart sound. Rectal exam reveals a firm and nodular prostate that is non-tender and a fecal-occult sample that is negative for blood. What is this patient's presentation most concerning for?","A cardiac cause of syncope—most concerning for an arrhythmic or structural cardiac event (eg, syncope from LV hypertrophy/ischemia → risk of sudden cardiac death). 

Rationale: no prodrome, S4 (stiff LV from long‑standing HTN) and cardiovascular risk factors point to a cardiac etiology rather than benign vasovagal or orthostatic causes.",Prostate cancer,True,CORRECT
"A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of unusual behavior that started 3 hours ago while he was at a party. He has a history of major depressive disorder and seasonal allergies. His mother has a history of anxiety. He drinks 5 beers on the weekends.

On physical examination, patient appears lethargic and tired. Skin is dry and coarse, and there is generalized pitting edema present. A complete blood count (CBC) and a peripheral blood smear show evidence of normochromic, normocytic anemia. Additional laboratory tests reveal decreased serum level of iron, decreased TIBC (total iron-binding capacity) and increased serum level of ferritin. What is the most likely etiology of the anemia in this patient?","Most likely anemia of chronic disease (anemia of inflammation). Chronic inflammation (eg, recent MI/heart disease, post-surgical/ongoing cardiac illness) → IL-6–mediated ↑hepcidin → decreased ferroportin activity, reduced iron release from macrophages and decreased gut iron absorption. This produces low serum iron, low TIBC, and high ferritin with a normocytic, normochromic anemia.",Anemia of chronic disease,True,CORRECT
"A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain. She denies any previous episodes of hematuria.

"A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of worsening pain in his left buttock. The pain is described as a deep, dull ache that is worse at night. He does not report any recent trauma. He has hyperlipidemia. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years and drinks one beer every night. He does not use illicit drugs. His only medication is simvastatin. Physical examination shows tenderness over the left gluteal region. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An x-ray of the pelvis shows a 4-cm, poorly defined, osteolytic lesion in the left ilium with a moth-eaten pattern of bone destruction, multiple well-defined sclerotic lesions, and an aggressive periosteal reaction. The remainder of the physical examination, including rectal examination, shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely osteosarcoma (secondary to Paget disease of bone).

Rationale: an aggressive, poorly defined osteolytic lesion with a moth‑eaten pattern and periosteal reaction in an older adult arising in a pelvis that shows multiple sclerotic changes is most consistent with osteosarcoma arising in Paget disease. Metastases are more common overall, but prostate mets are typically sclerotic and solitary lytic lesions with this aggressive periosteal response in an older patient suggest secondary osteosarcoma.",Chondrosarcoma,True,CORRECT

"A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain and uneasiness. He says that symptoms onset acutely half an hour ago while he was watching television. He describes the pain as being 8/10 in intensity, sharp in character, localized to the center of the chest and retrosternal, and radiating to the back and shoulders. The patient denies any associated change in the pain with breathing or body position. He says he has associated nausea but denies any vomiting. He denies any recent history of fever, chills, or chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus for which he takes lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, and metformin.

"A 27-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of difficulty swallowing, and she describes that ""there is something in the back of her throat"". Furthermore, she also feels an ""achy"" chest pain that has been getting progressively worse over the last few weeks. She denies having any fever, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, heartburn, nausea, or vomiting. The patient has a history of wrist fracture as a child, migraines, and a recent diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Most likely a thymoma — an anterior mediastinal mass associated with myasthenia gravis causing compressive symptoms (sensation in the throat/odynophagia and progressive chest discomfort).,Benign tumor of the thymus,True,CORRECT
"A 6-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with a rash and intermittent abdominal pain and swelling of her legs and arms. She has also begun to complain of pain in her knees and hands with no history of trauma. Her temperature is 97.6°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 100/80 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for the finding in Figure A as well as symmetric swelling in the joints of the upper extremities. Her abdomen is currently nontender and not painful. Laboratory studies are pending, and the results of a urinalysis are notable only for positive blood and protein in the urine. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IgA-mediated small-vessel vasculitis). The classic triad — palpable purpuric rash (usually buttocks/legs), arthralgias, and abdominal pain — plus hematuria/proteinuria from IgA nephropathy fits this presentation.",Henoch-Schonlein purpura,True,CORRECT
A 51-year-old woman comes to the physician because of daytime sleepiness and dry mouth for one month. She says her sleepiness is due to getting up to urinate several times each night. She noticed increased thirst about a month ago and now drinks up to 20 cups of water daily. She does not feel a sudden urge prior to urinating and has not had dysuria. She has a history of multiple urinary tract infections and head trauma following a suicide attempt 3 months ago. She has bipolar I disorder and hypertension. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. Examination shows poor skin turgor. Mucous membranes are dry. Expiratory wheezes are heard over both lung fields.

"A 37-year-old G1P1001 delivers a male infant at 9 pounds 6 ounces after a C-section for preeclampsia with severe features. The mother has a history of type II diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c of 12.8% at her first obstetric visit. Before this pregnancy, she was taking metformin, and during this pregnancy, she was started on insulin. At her routine visits, her glucose logs frequently showed fasting fingerstick glucoses above 120 mg/dL and postprandial values above 180 mg/dL. In addition, her routine third trimester culture for group B Streptococcus was positive. At 38 weeks and 4 days gestation, she was found to have a blood pressure of 176/103 mmHg and reported a severe headache during a routine obstetric visit. She denied rupture of membranes or vaginal bleeding. Her physician sent her to the obstetric triage unit, and after failure of several intravenous doses of labetalol to lower her blood pressure and relieve her headache, a C-section was performed without complication. Fetal heart rate tracing had been reassuring throughout her admission. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 7 and 10. After one hour, the infant is found to be jittery; the infant's temperature is 96.1°F (35.6°C), blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 60/min. When the first feeding is attempted, he does not latch and begins to shake his arms and legs. After 20 seconds, the episode ends and the infant becomes lethargic. What is the most likely cause of this infant’s presentation?","Neonatal hypoglycemia from fetal hyperinsulinemia due to poorly controlled maternal diabetes. Maternal hyperglycemia → fetal islet cell hyperplasia and high insulin; after birth the glucose supply stops and the infant becomes hypoglycemic, causing jitteriness, poor feeding, tremors, and lethargy.",ß-cell hyperplasia,False,WRONG
"A 47-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a fever and a headache. Her symptoms started yesterday and have rapidly progressed. Initially, she was experiencing just a fever and a headache which she was treating with acetaminophen. It rapidly progressed to blurry vision, chills, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension and she is currently taking insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and oral contraceptive pills. Her temperature is 104°F (40.0°C), blood pressure is 157/93 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Upon further inspection, the patient also demonstrates exophthalmos in the affected eye. The patient's extraocular movements are notably decreased in the affected eye with reduced vertical and horizontal gaze. The patient also demonstrates decreased sensation near the affected eye in the distribution of V1 and V2. While the patient is in the department waiting for a CT scan, she becomes lethargic and acutely altered. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis. 

Reason: acute high fever and severe headache with rapid progression to ipsilateral proptosis, ophthalmoplegia (III/IV/VI dysfunction), and loss of V1/V2 facial sensation — classic cavernous sinus involvement from an infectious thrombosis with intracranial extension (explaining lethargy). This is an emergency requiring urgent IV antibiotics, neurosurgical/ENT evaluation, and imaging (MRI/MR venography).",Cavernous sinus thrombosis,True,CORRECT
"A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely peripheral arterial disease (atherosclerotic lower‑extremity ischemia) causing intermittent claudication of the right calf. Evidence: exertional calf pain relieved by rest, absent right pedal pulses, elevation‑induced pallor/paresthesia, and strong atherosclerotic risk factors (smoking, diabetes, HTN).",Femoropopliteal artery stenosis,True,CORRECT
"A 13-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for 5 days of abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and mild diarrhea. Her parents have been giving her acetaminophen in the past 3 days, which they stopped 24 hours ago when they noted blood in their daughter's urine. Upon admission, the patient has a fever of 39.6°C (103.3°F) and is hemodynamically stable. While waiting for the results of the laboratory tests, the patient develops intense left flank pain, and nausea and vomiting intensifies. Her condition rapidly deteriorates with an abnormally high blood pressure of 180/100 mm Hg, a heart rate of 120/min, and labored breathing leading to ventilatory failure. Under these conditions, the ER team immediately transfers the patient to the pediatric ICU, however, the patient dies shortly after. The pathologist shares with you some excerpts from her complete blood count and peripheral smear report:

"A 73-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute substernal chest pain that began a few hours ago. The pain is described as a “pressure” that radiates to his left arm. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is on chlorthalidone for his hypertension and simvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking and drinks 1-2 beers on weekends. His EKG shows ST depressions in the anterior precordial leads and he is given the proper medications and sent for emergency revascularization. Seven days later, he develops dyspnea that worsens in the supine position. Bibasilar crackles are heard on pulmonary auscultation. Cardiac exam reveals a new 3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s new symptoms?",Postinfarction ventricular septal rupture — macrophage-mediated degradation of necrotic septal myocardium 3–7 days after a transmural MI producing an acute left-to-right shunt. This causes pulmonary edema and a new holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border.,Papillary muscle rupture,False,WRONG
"A 57-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police after he was found running around a local park naked and screaming late at night. During intake, the patient talks non-stop about the government spying on him and his family, but provides little useful information besides his name and date of birth. Occasionally he refers to himself in the third person. He refuses to eat anything and will only drink clear fluids because he is afraid of being poisoned. A medical records search reveals that the patient has been treated for psychotic behavior and occasional bouts of severe depression for several years. Today, his heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, he appears gaunt and anxious. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely schizoaffective disorder (depressive type). 

Rationale: he has chronic psychotic symptoms independent of mood episodes (years of psychosis) with intermittent severe depressive episodes. Normal labs/toxicology make substance- or medical-induced psychosis unlikely.",Schizoaffective disorder,False,WRONG
"A man returns home late at night to find his 15-year-old son and 40-year-old wife unconscious in the family room. He immediately summons emergency services. In the field, pulse oximetry shows oxygen saturation at 100% for both patients. 100% yet they both appear cyanotic. Both patients are provided with 2L of oxygen by way of nasal cannula on the way to the hospital. An arterial blood gas is performed on the teenager and reveals pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 31.8 mm Hg, PaO2 of 150 mm Hg, HCO3- of 20 mEq/L, SaO2 of 80%, and a COHb of 18%. What is the most likely cause of his condition?","Carbon monoxide poisoning (carboxyhemoglobinemia) from inhalation of combustion products (eg, faulty furnace or car exhaust). CO binds hemoglobin with high affinity, leaving PaO2 normal but reducing SaO2 and causing tissue hypoxia; pulse oximetry reads falsely high.",Carbon monoxide poisoning,True,CORRECT
"A 20-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to his back during an altercation. He reports weakness and numbness of the lower extremities. He has no history of serious illness. On arrival, he is alert and cooperative. His pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg. Examination shows a deep 4-cm laceration on his back next to the vertebral column at the level of the T10 vertebra. Neurologic examination shows right-sided flaccid paralysis with a diminished vibratory sense ipsilaterally, decreased sensation to light touch at the level of his laceration and below, and left-sided loss of hot, cold, and pin-prick sensation at the level of the umbilicus and below. Deep tendon reflexes of his right lower extremity are 4+ and symmetrical. Babinski sign is absent bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Brown-Séquard syndrome from a right-sided hemisection of the spinal cord at about T10. This explains ipsilateral (right) motor paralysis and loss of vibration/proprioception and contralateral (left) loss of pain/temperature below the lesion. (Early flaccidity can reflect spinal shock; long-term signs become spastic with hyperreflexia.),Brown-Sequard syndrome,True,CORRECT
"A 7-year-old boy presents to an urgent care center for a rash that began approximately 2 days ago. According to his mother, it began as a pink rash on his face and has subsequently spread to his trunk. The child was adopted and has not yet begun care with his pediatrician. His temperature is 100.2°F (37.9°C), blood pressure is 104/74 mmHg, pulse is 99/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

What is the most likely the reason for this patient's complaints?","He has an acute subdural hematoma — venous bleeding from torn bridging veins (crescent-shaped hyperdensity on CT) after head trauma, worsened by warfarin-induced coagulopathy causing increased ICP, headache, nausea and confusion.",Subdural hematoma,False,WRONG
"A 13-year-old teenage girl was brought to the emergency department by her mom after she collapsed. Her mom reports that she was at a birthday party when all of a sudden she fell. She reported left foot weakness and has been limping ever since. The patient has been healthy and had an uncomplicated birth history, though her mom reports that she just recovered from a cold. She currently lives with her younger sister and mother as her parents recently divorced. She does well in school and has a handful of good friends. Her physical exam demonstrated normal bulk and tone, 5/5 strength in all motions, 2+ and symmetric reflexes at biceps, triceps and knees. She had 1+ ankle reflex on left. What is the most likely explanation for her symptoms?","Most likely a conversion (functional neurologic) disorder — a psychogenic weakness. 

Reason: acute onset in an adolescent female with recent psychosocial stressors, normal motor exam and reflexes except a mildly decreased ankle reflex (clinically insignificant), and no objective neurologic deficit to explain true focal paresis. This pattern fits conversion disorder rather than an organic cause (e.g., Guillain-Barré or radiculopathy).",Conversion disorder,True,CORRECT
"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, has back pain and numbness in her lower extremities after an emergency cesarean delivery of a healthy 3856-g (8-lb, 8-oz) newborn male. She had a placental abruption and lost approximately 2000 ml of blood. During the procedure, she received two units of packed red blood cells and intravenous fluids.

She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased sensation to temperature and pinprick below her waist and 0/5 muscle strength in her lower extremities. She feels the vibrations of a tuning fork placed on both of her great toes. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 2+ in the upper extremities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anterior spinal (anterior cord) syndrome from ischemic infarction of the anterior spinal artery — acute anterior cord ischemia after hypovolemia. It produces bilateral loss of motor function and pain/temperature below the lesion with preserved dorsal-column vibration/proprioception.,Anterior spinal artery syndrome,True,CORRECT
"A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of sharp chest pain. She says that the pain is worse when she inhales and is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Her past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis, myocardial infarction status post coronary artery bypass graft, and radiation for breast cancer 20 years ago. Physical exam reveals a rubbing sound upon cardiac auscultation as well as increased jugular venous distention on inspiration. Pericardiocentesis is performed revealing grossly bloody fluid. What is most specifically associated with this patient's presentation?","A hemorrhagic (malignant) pericardial effusion — most commonly from metastatic cancer (eg, breast cancer) — which produces bloody pericardial fluid in the setting of acute pericarditis.",Malignancy,True,CORRECT
"A 36-year-old female with a history of end stage renal disease secondary to poorly controlled type I diabetes on peritoneal dialysis presents to her nephrologist's office with chest pain, shortness of breath, and extreme fatigue.

A 46,XX fetus with this enzyme defect shunts steroid precursors into androgen synthesis, virilizing the external genitalia while internal female structures and ovaries (not palpable externally) remain. Lab findings would show ↑17‑hydroxyprogesterone, ↓cortisol (± ↓aldosterone in salt‑wasting form).",Exposure to excessive androgenic steroids during gestation,True,CORRECT
"A 61-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of fatigue and feeling sad. She reports that ever since her husband passed away 3 months ago, she has noticed a decrease in her energy level and reports frequently awaking at 2 in the morning and cannot fall back asleep. She sometimes wakes up and hears her husband's voice, constantly thinks about how much she misses him, and has recently thought about ways to kill herself including driving through a red light. She used to be an active member of her neighborhood’s bridge club but has stopped playing. She has lost 15 pounds and rarely feels hungry. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Major depressive disorder (a major depressive episode precipitated by bereavement).

Rationale: Although grief can include preoccupation with the deceased and transient hallucinations, the patient has marked functional impairment, significant weight loss, early-morning awakening, anhedonia (stopped activities) and active suicidal ideation/intent — features that favor MDD rather than uncomplicated bereavement. Persistent complex (complicated) bereavement would require a longer duration (>6 months).",Major depressive disorder,True,CORRECT
"A 52-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient is complaining only of left hip pain which has been ongoing for the past 6-8 months. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 137/88 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Examination of the left hip reveals mild crepitus, appropriate range of motion, adequate distal sensation, and palpable posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses. A CT scan is ordered as seen in Figure A. Labs demonstrate an alkaline phosphatase of 876 U/L with a normal vitamin D and parathyroid hormone level (PTH). What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's symptoms?","This presentation is most consistent with Paget disease of bone — driven by abnormal osteoclast hyperactivity with subsequent excessive, disorganized osteoblastic bone formation (classically linked to paramyxoviral infection of osteoclasts).",Paget disease of the bone,False,WRONG
"A 63-year-old man comes to the physician because of increasing generalized fatigue for 3 months. He is having more difficulty with keeping up with his activities of daily living and has lost 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) over the past month. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He does not smoke and drinks two to three beers on weekends. His medications include lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 125/73 mm Hg. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. His hematocrit is 27.3%, leukocyte count is 4500/mm3, and platelet count is 102,000/mm3. A peripheral blood smear shows numerous blast cells that stain positive for myeloperoxidase, CD33, and CD34. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Acute myelogenous leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia). The presentation of cytopenias with numerous myeloperoxidase-positive, CD33+/CD34+ blasts is characteristic of AML.",Acute myeloid leukemia,True,CORRECT
"A 65-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual well-check. Her past medical history includes diabetes and hypertension, which are well-controlled with metformin and losartan, respectively. The patient reports a healthy diet consisting of mainly vegetables and lean meat. She denies smoking or alcohol use. She enjoys taking walks with her husband and sunbathing. Physical examination is unremarkable expect for a rough, scaly, sand paper-like plaque on her left dorsal hand with no tenderness or pain. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Actinic keratosis (solar keratosis). The rough, scaly, sandpapery plaque on a sun-exposed dorsal hand in an older patient with significant sun exposure is classic for a UV-induced precancerous lesion that can progress to squamous cell carcinoma. Typical management options include cryotherapy, topical 5‑FU or imiquimod, photodynamic therapy, or biopsy if suspicious for invasive SCC.",Actinic keratosis,True,CORRECT
"A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 38 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding for the past hour. The patient reports that she felt contractions prior to the onset of the bleeding, but the contractions stopped after the bleeding started. She also has severe abdominal pain. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. Her pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness with no rebound or guarding; no contractions are felt. The fetal heart rate shows recurrent variable decelerations. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Uterine rupture (likely rupture of the previous low-transverse cesarean scar).  

Reason: prior cesarean is a risk factor; sudden severe abdominal pain with vaginal bleeding, cessation of contractions, maternal hypotension/tachycardia and acute fetal distress are classic for uterine rupture.",Uterine rupture,True,CORRECT
"A 39-year-old man seeks an evaluation in the emergency room due to an episode of syncope at work. He says that he has felt increasing shortness of breath while exercising over the past 6 months. He is a well-built man in mild distress. The vital signs include heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. The cardiac examination is significant for a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. Palpation of the carotid artery shows 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole. What is most consistent with these findings?",Findings are most consistent with hypertrophic (obstructive) cardiomyopathy from asymmetric septal hypertrophy with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction). The murmur increases with Valsalva/standing and the carotid bisferiens pulse fits HOCM.,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,True,CORRECT
"A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?","The bleeding is most likely from the cervix — a friable/bleeding cervix (eg, cervical ectropion or cervicitis with postcoital trauma). Ultrasound excludes placenta previa and the speculum exam shows a bruised, tender cervix as the source.",Cervical trauma,True,CORRECT
"A 35-year-old man presents with yellow discoloration of his eyes and skin for the past week. He also says he has pain in the right upper quadrant for the past few days. He is fatigued constantly and has recently developed acute onset itching all over his body. The patient denies any allergies. Past medical history is significant for ulcerative colitis diagnosed 2 years ago, managed medically. He is vaccinated against hepatitis A and B and denies any recent travel abroad. There is scleral icterus present, and mild hepatosplenomegaly is noted. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for:
Total bilirubin 3.4 mg/dL
Prothrombin time 12 s
Aspartate transaminase (AST) 158 IU/L
Alanine transaminase (ALT) 1161 IU/L
Alkaline phosphatase 502 IU/L
Serum albumin 3.1 g/dL
Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) positive
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Most likely diagnosis: primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

Reasoning: Young man with ulcerative colitis, progressive cholestatic picture (marked alkaline phosphatase elevation, jaundice, pruritus), hepatosplenomegaly, and p-ANCA positivity — classic for PSC. Diagnosis is confirmed by cholangiography (beading/stricturing of intra‑ and extrahepatic bile ducts). PSC carries an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer; definitive therapy is liver transplantation.",Primary sclerosing cholangitis,True,CORRECT
"A 33-year-old man presents with yellowing of the eyes. He says symptoms onset acutely 3 days ago and have not improved. He says he has had similar episodes for the past 10 years. Each episode is self-limited, lasting no more than 3–5 days. The patient denies any recent history of nausea, weight loss, abdominal pain, light-colored stools, dark urine, or pruritus. Current medications are herbal supplements and a multivitamin. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. His BMI is 32 kg/m2. Physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Total bilirubin 3 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL
AST/ALT/Alkaline phosphatase Normal
Hematocrit/lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/haptoglobin Normal
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Gilbert syndrome — benign, intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to reduced UDP‑glucuronosyltransferase activity. Fits recurrent short self‑limited jaundice, elevated indirect bilirubin with normal LFTs and no hemolysis.",Gilbert’s syndrome,True,CORRECT
"A 42-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis presents to the emergency room with four-day history of nausea, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain. He is on medical management with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5 ASA). Examination shows an ill appearing man with a tense, tympanitic abdominal exam. He is unable to be fully examined due to the abdominal pain. Vitals are T 38.2 C, HR 102 bpm BP 133/92 mmHg,2 RR 20 bpm, and O2 Sat 100% on room air. In the ED an abdominal radiograph is shown in Figure A. What is the diagnosis?","Toxic megacolon — acute colonic dilatation (plain film showing markedly dilated colon, usually >6 cm) in the setting of active ulcerative colitis with systemic toxicity.",Toxic megacolon,True,CORRECT
"An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents because of difficulty sleeping. One to two times per week for the past 2 months, she has woken up frightened in the middle of the night, yelling and crying. She has not seemed confused after waking up, and she is consolable and able to fall back asleep in her parents' bed. The following day, she seems more tired than usual at school. She recalls that she had a bad dream and looks for ways to delay bedtime in the evenings. She has met all her developmental milestones to date. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Nightmares (REM-related parasomnia / nightmare disorder). She awakens frightened but is consolable, remembers a bad dream, and avoids bedtime — features typical of nightmares rather than night terrors.",Nightmare disorder,True,CORRECT
"A 54-year-old woman presents to the emergency ward with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain is sharp and present in the anterior part of the chest. There is no radiation of the pain; however, the intensity is decreased while sitting and leaning forward. There is no associated shortness of breath. Vital signs are the following: blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg; pulse rate is 82/min, rhythmic, and regular. Lungs are clear on auscultation and cardiovascular examination demonstrates scratchy and squeaking sounds at the left sternal border and a 'knock' heard on auscultation. Kussmaul sign is positive and ECG shows new widespread ST segment elevation and PR depression in leads II, III and aVF. The most likely cause for these findings in this patient is?","This presentation is acute pericarditis (pleuritic chest pain relieved by leaning forward, pericardial friction rub, diffuse ST elevation with PR depression). The most likely cause is viral (idiopathic) pericarditis—classically Coxsackie B causing a serofibrinous pericarditis.",Constrictive pericarditis,False,WRONG
"A 56-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal swelling. She states that her abdomen has been swelling for the past several months but otherwise offers minimal history and is a poor historian. She thinks it worsened more rapidly last night. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 122/80 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A bedside ultrasound is performed as seen in Figure A and a sample of the fluid is taken and sent for analysis as seen below.

Fluid sample:
Cell count: < 50 leukocytes/mm^3
Albumin: 4.8 g/dL
Culture: pending
Total protein: 2.0 g/dL
Gram stain: pending

Laboratory values are notable for a serum albumin of 4.0 g/dL. What is the most likely cause of this patient's ascites?","The ascites is most likely malignant (peritoneal carcinomatosis), e.g. ovarian cancer.  
Rationale: SAAG = serum albumin − ascites albumin = 4.0 − 4.8 = −0.8 (<1.1), indicating non–portal hypertensive ascites (malignancy, infection, pancreatitis). Chronic progressive abdominal distension in a 56‑year‑old woman favors malignant ascites due to peritoneal spread (ovarian carcinoma).",Pancreatitis,False,WRONG
"A 19-year-old female college student comes to the physician for a sudden loss of visual acuity of her right eye. She noticed that she was unable to read the time on the alarm clock when she woke up in the morning. When she closes her right eye, she is able to see sharply. When she closes her left eye, she has blurry double vision. She does not recall trauma to her eye but has been working long nights on her honors thesis. She has a history of occasional shoulder luxation. She is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall, and weighs 62 kg (136 lbs); her BMI is 19.1 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, slender and long fingers are noted. She has several flat, demarcated brownish nevi on her left cheek. Ocular examination shows upward temporal subluxation of her right lens. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Marfan syndrome — fibrillin-1 (FBN1) disorder. The superotemporal lens subluxation, tall, slender habitus with arachnodactyly and joint laxity point to Marfan (contrast: homocystinuria causes inferomedial lens displacement and hypercoagulability/ID). Check for aortic root dilation.",Marfan syndrome,True,CORRECT
"A 58-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider complaining fatigue and a vague muscle pain in her limbs. She always seems tired and has difficulty getting through her workday and doing chores around the house. This has been going on for several months and her symptoms seem to be getting worse. She also admits to long bouts of constipation. Past medical history is significant for cirrhosis and kidney stones. She was taking acetaminophen for the pain, but that no longer provides relief, and polyethylene glycol to treat her constipation. Today, her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 85/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, she has a regular rhythm, and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her laboratory results are as follows:

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 50 U/L
Total bilirubin 1.10 mg/dL
Serum albumin 2.0 g/dL
Calcium 10.6 mg/dL
What is the cause of this patient’s symptoms?","Her symptoms are from hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism (most likely a parathyroid adenoma). With albumin 2.0 g/dL the corrected Ca = 10.6 + 0.8*(4−2) ≈ 12.2 mg/dL, which explains fatigue, muscle pain, constipation and nephrolithiasis.",Hyperparathyroidism,True,CORRECT
"A 38-year-old woman presents with fever and acute onset chest pain for the past 12 hours. She describes the pain as severe, sharp and stabbing in character, and localized to the retrosternal area. She also says the pain is worse when she breathes deeply or coughs. Past medical history is significant for recently diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her vital signs include: blood pressure 110/75 mm Hg, pulse 95/min, and temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F). Physical examination is significant for a friction rub heard best at the lower left sternal border. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Acute pericarditis — most likely SLE-related serositis (acute inflammatory pericarditis), suggested by pleuritic retrosternal chest pain and a pericardial friction rub.",Serous pericarditis,False,WRONG
"A 65-year-old male is evaluated in clinic approximately six months after resolution of a herpes zoster outbreak on his left flank. He states that despite the lesions having resolved, he is still experiencing constant burning and hypersensitivity to touch in the distribution of the old rash. You explain to him that this complication can occur in 20-30% of patients after having herpes zoster. You also explain that vaccination with the shingles vaccine in individuals 60-70 years of age can reduce the incidence of this complication. What is the complication?","Postherpetic neuralgia — persistent neuropathic pain (burning, allodynia) in the dermatome of a prior herpes zoster outbreak.",Post-herpetic neuralgia,True,CORRECT
"A 47-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by paramedics. She was found unconscious on a park bench by a bystander. Her history is unobtainable. Vitals include a pulse of 64/min, a respiratory rate of 7/min, and a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg. On examination, the patient is unresponsive to voice and touch but shows a flexor response to pain. Her breathing is shallow. The pupils are constricted, and a response to light cannot be determined. An arterial blood gas sample reveals:
pH 7.26
Pco2 70 mm Hg
HCO3-  26 mEq/L
What could explain this patient's presentation?","An acute (uncompensated) respiratory acidosis from hypoventilation — most consistent with opioid overdose (eg, heroin/morphine). The high PCO2 with near‑normal HCO3−, depressed consciousness, shallow respirations and pinpoint pupils point to opioid-induced respiratory depression; treat with naloxone.",Opioid overdose,True,CORRECT
"A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain. The patient states he was at a barbecue around noon. Lunch was arranged as a buffet without refrigeration. Within 2 to 3 hours, he had abdominal pain with 3 episodes of watery diarrhea. On exam, vital signs are T 99.1, HR 103, BP 110/55, RR 14. Abdominal exam is significant for pain to deep palpation without any rebounding or guarding. There is no blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT). What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?","Foodborne illness from a preformed Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin in the unrefrigerated food. The short incubation (1–6 hr), sudden cramps/diarrhea after a buffet, lack of fever or blood on stool point to a toxin-mediated (noninvasive) S. aureus food poisoning.",Staphylococcus aureus,False,WRONG
A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of right foot pain for 3 months. She has a burning sensation in the plantar area between the third and fourth metatarsals that radiates to the third and fourth digits. She had a right distal radius fracture that was treated with a splint and physical therapy three months ago. She is an account executive and wears high heels to work every day. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right lower extremity shows intact skin. The posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses are palpable. When pressure is applied to the sole of the foot between the metatarsal heads the patient feels pain and there is an audible click. Tapping on the affected area causes pain that shoots into the third and fourth digits. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"Morton's neuroma (interdigital neuroma) — entrapment of the common digital nerve between the 3rd and 4th metatarsal heads, classically causing burning forefoot pain radiating to the toes with a Mulder's click and pain on compression/exquisite tenderness.",Intermetatarsal neuroma,True,CORRECT
"A 5-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician by her mother. The mother is concerned about a fine, red rash on her daughter’s limbs and easy bruising. The rash started about 1 week ago and has progressed. Past medical history is significant for a minor cold two weeks ago. The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. Today, she has a heart rate of 90/min, respiratory rate of 22/min, blood pressure of 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the girl has a petechial rash on her arms and legs. Additionally, there are several bruises on her shins and thighs. A CBC shows thrombocytopenia (20,000/mm3). Other parameters of the CBC are within expected range for her age. Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and metabolic panels are all within reference range. What is the most likely blood disorder?","Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

Reason: isolated severe thrombocytopenia after a recent viral illness with mucocutaneous bleeding (petechiae, bruising) and normal PT/PTT and other CBC indices — classic for antibody‑mediated platelet destruction in pediatric acute ITP. Management is often observation if mild; IVIG or corticosteroids for significant bleeding or very low platelet counts.",Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),True,CORRECT
"A 80-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department from a senior living home with a chief complaint of acute onset and severe abdominal pain with 5 episodes of bloody diarrhea. She has a history of having chronic constipation, and postprandial abdominal pain which subsides after taking nitroglycerin. The abdominal pain that she is currently experiencing did not subside using her medication. A week ago, she had a percutaneous intervention for an inferior wall STEMI. On physical examination, the patient looks pale and confused. The vital signs include: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). The patient receives an aggressive treatment consisting of intravenous fluids and vasopressors, and she is transferred to the ICU. Despite all the necessary interventions, the patient dies. During the autopsy, a dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon is noted. What is the most likely pathology related to her death?",Acute mesenteric ischemia from an arterial embolus (most likely a left ventricular mural thrombus formed after her recent MI) causing infarction/ischemic colitis of the sigmoid colon.,Transmural infarction,False,WRONG
"A 44-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with jaundice and diffuse abdominal pain. She denies any previous medical problems and says she does not take any medications, drugs, or supplements. Her temperature is 97.6°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 133/87 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam is notable for sclera which are icteric and there is tenderness to palpation over the right upper quadrant. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.

Hepatitis B surface antigen: Positive
Hepatitis B surface IgG: Negative
Hepatitis B core antigen: Positive
Hepatitis B core IgG: Positive
Hepatitis B E antigen: Positive
Hepatitis B E IgG: Positive

What is the most likely diagnosis?","Chronic hepatitis B infection with active viral replication (highly infectious). 

Rationale: HBsAg positive with anti-HBc IgG (not IgM) indicates chronic rather than acute infection, HBeAg positivity indicates active replication/high infectivity, and anti-HBs is absent.",Chronic hepatitis B infection,True,CORRECT
"A 23-year-old female presents with a week of malaise, muscle and joint aches, nausea, and headaches. Her history is significant for migraine headaches and gonorrhea/chlamydia treated on multiple occasions. She has not traveled recently, but does admit to daily IV heroin use and occasional unprotected sexual intercourse for drugs or money. Physical exam reveals scleral icterus and hepatomegaly. The patient is admitted for supportive treatment. On day 3 of the hospital stay, the physician on-call notices a change in some of the patient's laboratory values, shown in Figure A. The change in laboratory results are most indicative of which of the following conditions?","Acute (primary) hepatitis B infection. The serologic pattern shown (positive HBsAg with IgM anti-HBc, often ±HBeAg) is diagnostic of recent acute HBV infection and fits her IV‑drug use/sexual exposure and acute jaundice.",Progression to fulminant hepatitis,False,WRONG
"A 43-year-old woman presents to a new primary care physician complaining of anxiety. She has been worrying non-stop recently about the possibility that her husband will lose his job as a teacher. Her husband, who is present, assures the physician that his job is entirely secure and states that she has ""fretted"" for their entire marriage, though the exact topic causing her anxiety varies over time. She also worries excessively about everyday tasks, such as whether she will catch the train on time and whether their house in Southern California is sufficiently earthquake-proof. She has no way to overcome these worries. She endorses other symptoms including poor sleep (associated with racing thoughts about her various worries), fatigue, and impaired concentration at work, all of which have been present for at least the past year. Her vital signs are within normal limits and there are no abnormalities on physical exam. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Generalized anxiety disorder.

She has excessive, uncontrollable worry about multiple domains for >6 months with associated symptoms (insomnia, fatigue, poor concentration) causing impairment—fulfilling DSM criteria for GAD.",Generalized anxiety disorder,True,CORRECT
"An 11-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of severe abdominal pain. She says that the pain started near the middle of her abdomen and moved to the right lower quadrant after about 10 hours. Several hours after the pain started she also started experiencing nausea and loss of appetite. On presentation, her temperature is 102.5°F (39.2°C), blood pressure is 115/74 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 21/min. Physical exam reveals rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Raising the patient's right leg with the knee flexed significantly increases the pain. What is the most common cause of this patient's symptoms in children?","Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (eg, mucosal/mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia after viral infection) causing luminal obstruction of the appendix.",Lymphoid hyperplasia,True,CORRECT
"A 70-year-old male presents to the emergency department with fever and productive cough that has progressed rapidly over the past day. On exam, he is very ill appearing and his vitals demonstrate T: 39 deg C, HR: 95 bpm, BP: 80/40 mmHg, RR: 15, SaO2: 93%. A CBC is obtained which demonstrates a white blood cell count (WBC) of 14,000. A chest radiograph is obtained which is demonstrated in Figure A. The patient is subsequently diagnosed with severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia and is transferred to the ICU after intubation, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and resuscitation measures are initiated. The patient improves steadily over the subsequent days in the ICU with improving vitals and decreasing WBC. However, on hospital day 4 he develops a fever to 41 deg C, and his WBC elevates to 16,000. On exam, he appears to withdraw in pain when his abdomen is palpated. Liver function tests and amylase/lipase are ordered and shown to be within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasound is obtained which is demonstrated in Figure B. What is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation?","Acalculous cholecystitis from critical illness/ischemia of the gallbladder. In ICU patients after severe sepsis/ventilation you can get gallbladder stasis and ischemia causing RUQ pain, high fever and leukocytosis with normal LFT/amylase; ultrasound classically shows gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid without stones.",Acute acalculous cholecystitis,True,CORRECT
"A 6-month-old girl presents with recurring skin infections. Past medical history is significant for 3 episodes of acute otitis media since birth. The patient was born at 39 weeks via an uncomplicated, spontaneous transvaginal delivery, but there was delayed umbilical cord separation. She has met all developmental milestones. On physical examination, the skin around her mouth is inflamed and red. What is most likely responsible for this child’s clinical presentation?","A defect in the β2 integrin (CD18) subunit — leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 — causing impaired neutrophil adhesion/transmigration (failure of neutrophil extravasation; delayed umbilical cord separation, recurrent skin/soft-tissue infections).",Absence of CD18 molecule on the surface of leukocytes,True,CORRECT
"A 52-year-old African-American woman presents to the office complaining of difficulty swallowing for 1 week, and described it as ""food getting stuck in her throat"". Her discomfort is mainly for solid foods, and she does not have any problem with liquids. She further adds that she has frequent heartburn and lost 5 pounds in the last month because of this discomfort. She sometimes takes antacids to relieve her heartburn. Her past medical history is insignificant. She is an occasional drinker and smokes a half pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, her skin is shiny and taut especially around her lips and fingertips. A barium swallow study is ordered. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely systemic sclerosis (scleroderma—CREST) with esophageal involvement causing reflux and a peptic stricture. 

Reason: the shiny, taut skin/sclerodactyly points to scleroderma; esophageal dysmotility → severe GERD and peptic stricturing produces progressive dysphagia to solids.",Scleroderma,True,CORRECT
"An obese 42-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a complaint of left knee pain for the past 3 months. She describes the pain as affecting the inside part of the knee as well as the front of her knee, below the kneecap. She denies any inciting injury or trauma to the knee but reports that the pain is worse when she is climbing up stairs or rising from a chair. Physical examination is significant for localized tenderness to palpation over the left anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line. There is no joint effusion noted. Valgus stress testing is negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint. Radiographs of the left knee are obtained and reveal only mild arthritis, without evidence of any fractures or bony lesions. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Pes anserine (pes anserinus) bursitis — inflammation at the pes anserinus insertion on the anteromedial proximal tibia (classically ~5–6 cm below the joint line), common in overweight middle‑aged women and worsened by stair climbing or rising from a chair.",Pes anserine bursitis,True,CORRECT

"A 25-year-old man is in the middle of an ascent up a mountain, at an elevation of about 4,500 meters. This is the 4th day of his expedition. His friend notices that in the last few hours, he has been coughing frequently and appears to be short of breath. He has used his albuterol inhaler twice in the past 4 hours, but it does not seem to help. Within the past hour, he has coughed up some frothy, slightly pink sputum and is now complaining of nausea and headache. Other than his asthma, which has been well-controlled on a steroid inhaler, he is healthy. What is the most likely cause of this man’s symptoms?","High‑altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) — hypoxia at 4,500 m causes uneven hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction → marked pulmonary hypertension and capillary stress‑failure with protein/RBC leak into alveoli, producing noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (pink, frothy sputum), dyspnea and headache.",Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema,True,CORRECT
"A 54-year-old African American man presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. He was at home watching television when his symptoms began. He has a past medical history of COPD, alcohol abuse, diabetes, asthma, obesity, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and hypertension. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history as well. His current medications include albuterol, insulin, nicotine patches, duloxetine, hydroxyurea, and lisinopril. Chest radiography confirms the diagnosis of a spontaneous pneumothorax.

On the medical floor, the patient complains of continued fatigue and minor chest pain. A peripheral smear is ordered as seen in Figure A. An EKG is ordered and demonstrates a right bundle branch block which is unchanged from previous EKGs. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Megaloblastic (macrocytic) anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency (likely pernicious anemia). 

Reason: macrocytosis (MCV 125), low reticulocyte response, low B12, peripheral smear findings consistent with megaloblastic changes (eg, macro-ovalocytes/hypersegmented neutrophils) and history of neuropathy.",Myelodysplasia,False,WRONG
"A 8-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother and father due to decreasing activity and excessive sleepiness. The patient was born at full-term in the hospital with no complications. The patient's parents appear incredibly worried as their son has had no medical issues in the past. They show you videos of the child happily playing with his parents the day before. The patient’s mother states that the patient hit his head while crawling this morning and since then has been difficult to arouse. His mother is worried because she thinks he had a fever earlier in the day and he was clutching his head and neck in pain. Physical examination shows a barely arousable boy with a large, full anterior fontanelle. The boy grimaces on palpation of his chest, and a radiograph show posterior rib fractures. Retinal examination shows bilateral retinal hemorrhages. What is the most likely cause for this patient’s presentation?","Nonaccidental (abusive) head trauma — ""shaken baby"" syndrome causing tearing of bridging veins with subdural hemorrhage (↑ICP). Posterior rib fractures reflect chest squeezing; retinal hemorrhages from vitreoretinal traction.",Child abuse,True,CORRECT

HCO3-: 19 mEq/L
BUN: 16 mg/dL
Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
Glucose: 54 mg/dL
C-peptide: Low

What is the most likely diagnosis?","Exogenous insulin administration causing factitious hypoglycemia.  

Rationale: hypoglycemia with a low C‑peptide indicates insulin is from an exogenous source (endogenous insulin secretion would raise C‑peptide, as with insulinoma or sulfonylurea use). Her adrenergic episodes and seizure are due to severe hypoglycemia; family history of a diabetic mother suggests access to insulin.",Surreptitious insulin use,True,CORRECT
"A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after being found in a confused state on an interstate rest area in Florida. She is unable to recall her name, address, or any other information regarding her person. She denies being the woman on a Connecticut driver's license found in her wallet. A telephone call with the police department of her hometown reveals that she had been reported missing three days ago by her husband. When the husband arrives, he reports that his wife has had a great deal of stress at work lately and before she went missing, was anxious to tell her boss that she will not meet the deadline for her current project. She has had two major depressive episodes within the past 4 years that were treated with citalopram. She drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. She does not use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status exam, she is oriented only to time and place but not to person. Short-term memory is intact; she does not recognize her husband or recall important events of her life. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Dissociative fugue (a subtype of dissociative amnesia). 

She has sudden, stress-related travel away from home with inability to recall her identity and autobiographical information, preserved orientation to time/place and intact short-term memory, and no neurologic or substance cause—typical for a fugue state.",Dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue,True,CORRECT
"A 60-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife with a sudden onset of right-sided weakness 2 hours ago. He can speak clearly without difficulty and denies any similar symptoms in the past. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and diabetes, both poorly managed due to medication non-compliance. Family history is significant for heart disease and diabetes in multiple paternal and maternal relatives. His vital signs include: blood pressure 150/88 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, strength is 3/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left upper and lower extremities. The sensation is intact, and no impairments in balance or ataxias are present. An initial noncontrast CT scan of the head is unremarkable, but a repeat noncontrast CT scan of the head performed a month later reveals the 2 lesions circled in the image. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Lacunar infarcts (small-vessel ischemic infarcts) of the deep left hemisphere — most likely due to hypertensive/diabetic lipohyalinosis (producing a pure motor lacunar stroke in the posterior limb of the internal capsule).,Hyaline arteriosclerosis,True,CORRECT
"A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient was found unconscious on a train by the conductor at the last train station on the line. He has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, IV drug abuse, and a 22 pack-year smoking history. The patient smells of vomit and is minimally responsive. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 100/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Palpation of the patient's upper abdomen causes him to recoil his limbs. There are scars over the patient's antecubital fossae. The patient suddenly becomes tachypneic with an O2 saturation of 75% on 4L of 100% oxygen. A chest radiograph is taken and shown in Figure A. Which disease process is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",Acute pulmonary thromboembolism (venous thromboembolism from a lower‑extremity DVT) causing occlusion of pulmonary arteries with sudden V/Q mismatch/right‑heart strain (classic for sudden hypoxia and the CXR wedge infarct/Hampton hump).,Acute pancreatitis,False,WRONG
"A 49-year-old woman presents to her physician with a fever accompanied by chills and burning micturition since the past 5 days. She is an otherwise healthy woman with no significant past medical history and has an active sexual life. On physical examination, her temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), pulse rate is 90/min, blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Examination of the abdomen and genitourinary region do not reveal any specific positive findings. The physician orders a urinalysis of fresh unspun urine for this patient which shows 25 WBCs/mL of urine. The physician prescribes an empirical antibiotic and other medications for symptom relief. He also orders a bacteriological culture of her urine. After 48 hours of treatment, the woman returns to the physician to report that her symptoms have not improved. The bacteriological culture report indicates the growth of gram-negative bacilli which are lactose-negative and indole-negative, which produce a substance that hydrolyzes urea to produce ammonia. What bacteria is the most likely cause of infection in the woman?","Proteus mirabilis.

Reason: Proteus spp. are gram-negative, non–lactose-fermenting bacilli that are strongly urease-positive (hydrolyze urea to ammonia). Indole-negativity distinguishes P. mirabilis from indole-positive P. vulgaris.",Proteus mirabilis,True,CORRECT
"A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his neighbor, who found him lying unconscious at the door of his house. The patient lives alone and no further history is available.

His Glasgow Coma Scale score is 7 and the patient is intubated. A stat serum osmolality is reported at 260 mmol/kg. Based on the provided information, which of the following conditions is most likely present in this patient?","A hypotonic (low‑osmolality) hyponatremia most consistent with SIADH — excess ADH causing water retention, decreased serum Na+ and osmolality leading to cerebral edema and depressed consciousness.",Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone,False,WRONG
"A 37-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after falling down a flight of stairs. On arrival, she has shortness of breath, right-sided chest pain, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and right shoulder pain. She is otherwise healthy. She takes no medications. She appears pale. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 85/45 mm Hg. Examination shows several ecchymoses over the right chest. There is tenderness to palpation over the right chest wall and right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Bowel sounds are normal. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neck veins are flat. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Ruptured liver laceration with intra‑abdominal hemorrhage (hemoperitoneum) causing hypovolemic shock. 

Reason: blunt RUQ trauma with RUQ tenderness and referred right shoulder pain (diaphragmatic/phrenic irritation), hypotension/tachycardia and pallor consistent with hemorrhagic shock; normal chest exam and flat neck veins make tamponade, tension pneumothorax, or massive hemothorax less likely.",Liver hematoma,True,CORRECT
"A 45-year-old man presents to the clinic for an annual wellness checkup. He is relatively healthy and denies any pressing concerns. He endorses a healthy diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, and fish. He exercises for 30 minutes 3 times per week. He denies any headaches, chest pain, palpitations, fever, weight changes, or gastrointestinal issues. His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 154/78 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 12/min. As his previous appointment demonstrated elevated blood pressure, he is started on an anti-hypertensive medication. A week later, the patient presents to the office complaining of swelling of the face demonstrated in Figure A. He denies trauma, fever, pain, itchiness, respiratory difficulties, or recent upper respiratory infections. What is the most likely explanation for this finding?","Most likely ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema from accumulation of bradykinin. 

Rationale: onset shortly after starting an ACE inhibitor (eg, lisinopril), nonpruritic facial/lip swelling without urticaria or other allergic symptoms is classic for bradykinin‑mediated angioedema (ACE normally degrades bradykinin). Management: stop the ACE inhibitor immediately, monitor airway, and treat supportively (severe cases → airway intervention, icatibant or FFP may be used).",Deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor,False,WRONG
"An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency room by her mother because of wheezing for 1 day. The baby has never had similar symptoms. She also has a runny nose and a cough.

On examination, a clear nasal discharge is noticed with intercostal retractions. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral fine rales and diffuse fine wheezing. A chest X-ray is given in the exhibit. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Acute bronchiolitis — most likely RSV bronchiolitis (typical viral prodrome in an infant <2 years with diffuse wheeze, retractions, and CXR showing hyperinflation/peribronchial cuffing).",Bronchiolitis,True,CORRECT
"A 17-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a severe headache. The patient has had headaches in the past, but she describes this as the worst headache of her life. Her symptoms started yesterday and have been getting progressively worse. The patient states that the pain is mostly on one side of her head. There has been a recent outbreak of measles at the patient’s school, and the patient’s mother has been trying to give her daughter medicine to prevent her from getting sick, but the mother fears that her daughter may have caught the measles. On physical exam, you note an obese young girl who is clutching her head with the light in the room turned off. Her neurological exam is within normal limits. Fundoscopic exam reveals mild bilateral papilledema. A MRI of the head is obtained and reveals cerebral edema. A lumbar puncture reveals an increased opening pressure with a normal glucose level. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri).  
Fits an obese adolescent female with headache, bilateral papilledema, normal neuro exam, and elevated LP opening pressure with otherwise normal CSF.",Fat-soluble vitamin overuse,False,WRONG
"A 25-year-old woman with a psychiatric history of bipolar disorder is brought into the emergency department by emergency medical services. The patient is unconscious, but the mother states that she walked into the patient's room with the patient lying on the floor and an empty bottle of unknown pills next to her. The patient has previously tried to commit suicide 2 years ago. Upon presentation, the patient's vitals are HR 110, BP 105/60, T 99.5, RR 22.

"A 67-year-old man with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus presents to the ED with severe chest pain. The pain started suddenly a few hours ago, characterized as sharp and radiating to his back. He has never experienced pain like this before. He also has been sweaty, short of breath, and nauseous, but denies cough, fever, vomiting, or a history of trauma. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day since age 15, and currently takes lisonopril, amlodipine, metformin, and atorvastatin. In the ED, his temperature is 98.5 deg F (36.9 deg C), blood pressure is 85/50 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 25/min. An EKG is seen in Figure A and appears similar to an EKG obtained 1 month ago. He appears to be in moderate distress. Auscultation of his chest revealed no murmurs and his lungs are clear bilaterally. There is no tenderness to palpation along his chest wall. His abdominal exam is noteworthy for a pulsatile mass. The rest of his exam is within normal limits. Appropriate management is initiated. What is the most likely etiology of this patient's acute chest pain?","Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm from atherosclerotic weakening of the aortic wall.  
(History of sudden severe back-radiating pain, hypotension and a pulsatile abdominal mass with a nonischemic EKG is classic for ruptured AAA.)",Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,False,WRONG
"A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headache, blurring of vision, and numbness of the right leg for the past 2 hours. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include enalapril and metformin. He is oriented only to person. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 99/min and blood pressure is 158/94 mm Hg. Examination shows equal pupils that are reactive to light. Muscle strength is normal in all extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Sensation to fine touch and position is decreased over the right lower extremity. The confrontation test shows loss of the nasal field in the left eye and the temporal field in the right eye with macular sparing. He is unable to read phrases shown to him but can write them when they are dictated to him. He has short-term memory deficits. What is the most likely cause for this patient's symptoms?","An acute left PCA territory infarct — infarction of the left occipital lobe (primary visual cortex) with nearby PCA branch involvement (eg, thalamogeniculate/medial temporal branches). 

Rationale: the deficit described is a right homonymous hemianopia (loss of nasal field left eye + temporal field right eye) with macular sparing (occipital cortex/PCA). Associated contralateral right lower‑extremity sensory loss and short‑term memory impairment fit involvement of PCA‑supplied thalamic/medial temporal structures.",Infarct of the left posterior cerebral artery,True,CORRECT

"A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after sustaining a gunshot wound to her shoulder. During the course of the physical exam, the physician notes her spleen is palpable 10 cm below the left costal margin. Additionally, radiography of her shoulder showed several 'punched-out' areas of lytic bone. While this was considered an incidental finding at the time, she was referred to her primary care physician for further workup. Subsequent biopsy of the spleen demonstrated that this patient’s splenomegaly was caused by an infiltrative process. What processes would most likely result in splenomegaly in this patient?","Infiltrative splenomegaly is most commonly due to deposition or invasion of the spleen by abnormal cells or material, e.g.:

What is the most likely underlying etiology for this patient’s respiratory distress?","A transudative pleural effusion from congestive heart failure — increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure (LV failure) causing low‑protein, low‑LDH pleural fluid.",Cirrhosis,False,WRONG
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with dizziness. He states he has experienced a sustained sensation of the room spinning that is low grade and constant since this morning. The patient occasionally feels nauseous and has been taking diphenydramine to sleep which helps with his symptoms. The patient is generally healthy, has no other medical conditions, and only endorses eating more garlic recently to get over a cold he had a few days ago. His temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 122/81 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a healthy man. The patient is sat upright, his head is turned slightly to the right, and he is laid back flat rapidly. This does not provoke any symptoms even when repeated on the left side. A nystagmus is notable on cranial nerve exam as well as bilateral decreased hearing. The patient’s tandem gait is unstable; however, his baseline gait appears unremarkable despite the patient stating he has a sustained sensation of imbalance. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Acute labyrinthitis (viral labyrinthitis). 

Rationale: continuous, sustained vertigo after a recent URI with accompanying hearing loss and nystagmus, negative Dix–Hallpike (not episodic BPPV), and improvement with vestibular suppressants fits labyrinthitis rather than vestibular neuritis (which lacks hearing loss) or a positional/central cause.",Labyrinthitis,False,WRONG
"A 22-year-old man presents to a psychiatrist complaining of mood fluctuations. He is accompanied by his mother who reports that the patient recently experienced a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy. The patient admits to spending $2,000 of his parent’s money, without asking, on a down payment for a motorcycle. The episode resolved after 5 days, at which point the patient felt guilty and upset. The patient’s medical history is notable for multiple month-long episodes in the past 2 years of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. The patient has a history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17 requiring four days in the intensive care unit. During that episode, he reported seeing monkeys in his hospital room. On exam, he is a well-appearing, cooperative male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect. He states that he feels sad and guilty about what happens. He denies suicidal ideation. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Bipolar II disorder.

Rationale: He has a hypomanic episode (≥4 days of decreased need for sleep, increased energy, impulsive spending) plus recurrent major depressive episodes lasting months. There is no clear manic episode (≥1 week, marked impairment, psychosis/hospitalization), so the diagnosis is bipolar II rather than bipolar I.",Bipolar II disorder,True,CORRECT
"A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes.

"A 36-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for acute onset chest pain. She just returned from Japan 2 days ago and reports 7/10 chest pain that is worse with deep inspirations. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She currently takes oral contraceptives for birth control. A computed tomography scan is performed and demonstrates an embolus at the right lung. She is subsequently started on intravenous heparin with a transition to an oral medication at discharge. Three days after discharge, she returns to the emergency department for skin findings shown in Figure A. She denies any fever, flu-like symptoms, trauma, or abnormal contact. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s condition?","Warfarin-induced skin necrosis from a transient hypercoagulable state — initiation of warfarin (vitamin K antagonist) caused rapid depletion of protein C (short half‑life) relative to procoagulant factors, producing microvascular thrombosis of the skin (classically 3–5 days after starting warfarin), often seen in patients with underlying protein C deficiency or inadequate heparin bridge.",Deficiency of protein C,True,CORRECT
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of left shoulder pain for several weeks. He says that the pain often worsens when he tries to sleep on his left side. Although he tried several pain medications, none of the pain medications helped. He is an amateur tennis player who practices on weekends. He denies any trauma during his practice sessions. On examination of the shoulder joint, severe tenderness was present localized to the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint along with biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove. The range of motion was limited to the left side. An X-ray of the joint showed narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion. Routine blood test results are normal except for the rheumatoid factor, which is positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely subacromial impingement—rotator cuff (supraspinatus) tendinopathy with subacromial bursitis. 

Reason: pain over the greater tuberosity and bicipital groove, worse with lying on the affected side/overhead use (tennis), and x‑ray showing decreased acromiohumeral space with acromial spurring are classic for impingement; the positive rheumatoid factor is an incidental distractor.",Rotator cuff injury,True,CORRECT
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing pain and swelling in her right foot for the past 2 weeks. Initially, the pain was intermittent but it is now constant and she describes it as 8 out of 10 in intensity. She has not had any trauma to the foot or any previous problems with her joints. The pain has not allowed her to continue training for an upcoming marathon. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She is a model and has to regularly wear stilettos for fashion shows. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows swelling of the right forefoot. There is tenderness to palpation over the fifth metatarsal shaft. Pushing the fifth toe inwards produces pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Metatarsal stress fracture — likely an overuse (stress) fracture of the fifth metatarsal shaft. The insidious activity‑related pain, focal swelling/tenderness over the shaft, and pain with axial/medial pressure on the toe are classic for a metatarsal stress fracture (early X‑rays can be normal; MRI or bone scan is more sensitive).",Stress fracture,False,WRONG
A 65-year-old man is brought into the emergency department by his wife for slurred speech and right-sided weakness. The patient has a significant past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The wife reports her husband went to bed last night normally but woke up this morning with the symptoms mentioned. Physical examination shows right-sided hemiparesis along with the loss of vibration and proprioception. Cranial nerve examination shows a deviated tongue to the left. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Left medial medullary (Dejerine) infarct — likely occlusion of the left anterior spinal artery. The triad (contralateral hemiparesis and loss of vibration/proprioception from pyramidal tract/medial lemniscus plus ipsilateral tongue weakness/ deviation from CN XII) localizes to the medial medulla.,Dejerine syndrome,True,CORRECT
"A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of watery discharge from her right eye for 2 weeks. She and her parents, who are refugees from Sudan, arrived in Texas a month ago. Her immunization status is not known. She is at the 25th percentile for weight and the 50th percentile for height. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. Examination of the right eye shows matting of the eyelashes. Everting the right eyelid shows hyperemia, follicles, and papillae on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Slit-lamp examination of the right eye shows follicles in the limbic region and the bulbar conjunctiva. There is corneal haziness with neovascularization at the 12 o'clock position. Examination of the left eye is unremarkable. Direct opthalmoscopy of both eyes shows no abnormalities. Right pre-auricular lymphadenopathy is present. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Trachoma — chronic follicular conjunctivitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars A–C). Findings supporting this: endemic origin (Sudan), follicular conjunctivitis with limbal follicles, corneal neovascularization/pannus, matted lashes and preauricular lymphadenopathy.",Trachoma conjunctivitis,True,CORRECT
"A 30-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 30 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department because of progressive upper abdominal pain for the past hour. The patient vomited once on her way to the hospital. She states that she initially had dull stomach pain about 6 hours ago, but now the pain is located in the upper abdomen and is more severe.

Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows right upper quadrant tenderness. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,000/mm3. Urinalysis shows mild pyuria. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Acute appendicitis — in late pregnancy the enlarged uterus displaces the appendix upward, so appendiceal pain can present in the right upper quadrant. Fever, leukocytosis, vomiting and mild pyuria (irritation/contamination) support this diagnosis.",Appendicitis,False,WRONG
"A 69-year-old woman presents to the emergency department in severe abdominal pain. She states she was discharged from the hospital three days ago after being treated for a kidney infection with intravenous antibiotics. Over the last five days days, she has developed watery diarrhea and has been in almost constant pain which has now increased to an intensity of 10/10. On exam, her vitals are T 102.3F, HR 125, BP 89/45, RR 20. She has pain with palpation along her lower quadrants with questionable guarding. Her CBC is significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 25,000 cells/mcL along with Na 140, K 3.3, Cl 90 and HCO3- 15. Her lactic acid is 3.6 mmol/L. Figure A illustrates a radiograph of her abdomen. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely diagnosis: toxic megacolon from fulminant C. difficile (pseudomembranous) colitis.

Reasoning: recent IV antibiotics and watery diarrhea, high fever, hypotension, tachycardia, marked leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, severe abdominal pain/guarding, and abdominal radiograph classically showing a markedly dilated colon — all consistent with C. difficile–associated toxic megacolon.",Toxic Megacolon,False,WRONG
"A 23-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for muscle weakness. She states that she was at a rave when she was found down by one of her friends. Her friend waited with her to recover, but she has felt ill and abnormally weak. The patient admits to using MDMA, marijuana, and alcohol. Physical exam reveals a young woman who responds slowly to your questions. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Urine:
Color: Amber
Marijuana: Positive
Cocaine: Positive
MDMA: Positive
Blood: Positive

An ECG is ordered as seen in Figure A. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria causing hyperkalemia. (Urine dipstick positive for “blood” from myoglobin without RBCs; ECG changes from hyperkalemia — peaked T waves/widened QRS.),Rhabdomyolysis,True,CORRECT
"A 45-year-old man with a history of epilepsy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. He has had trouble moving the right side of his body for 2 weeks. Three weeks ago he was admitted to the hospital for a generalized convulsive seizure. He was treated with intravenous lorazepam and phenytoin; the seizure activity resolved after 50 minutes on EEG monitoring. He was discharged 2 days later after no further epileptic activity occurred. Physical examination at discharge showed no abnormalities. He has had multiple hospitalizations for similar episodes over the past year. His only medication is lamotrigine, though he says that he sometimes forgets to take it. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows right-sided hemiparesis, right homonymous hemianopsia, and receptive aphasia. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current symptoms?","Prolonged status epilepticus causing focal cerebral ischemic injury (neuronal necrosis from excitotoxicity/relative hypoperfusion) in the left MCA cortical territory — i.e., an ischemic infarct rather than transient Todd paralysis.",Cortical laminar necrosis,True,CORRECT
"A 58-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her husband complaining, “I can’t see out of my right eye.” She was watching television last night when she covered her left eye due to an itch and discovered that she could not see. The patient denies any precipitating event, pain, swelling, flashes, floaters, or headaches. Her past medical history is significant for uncontrolled hypertension and angina. Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and nitroglycerin as needed. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Fundus examination demonstrates generalized pallor and slight disc edema with no hemorrhages. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?","Most likely a central retinal artery occlusion (acute retinal ischemia from an embolus, e.g., atherosclerotic/cholesterol plaque). 

Reason: sudden, painless monocular vision loss in an atherosclerotic patient with a pale (ischemic) retina and slight disc swelling and no hemorrhages — classic for CRAO (vs. CRVO, optic neuritis, or giant-cell arteritis).",Occlusion of the ophthalmic artery by embolus,False,WRONG
"A 72-year-old man presents to the ED complaining of worsening abdominal pain over the last few hours. He also reports nausea, but denies fever, vomiting, or changes in the appearance of his bowel movements. His medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and peptic ulcer disease. Due to his recurrent bleeding peptic ulcers, he does not take warfarin. His surgical history is significant for an appendectomy as a child. His medications include metformin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and omeprazole. He has a 50-pack-year history of smoking. His temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 146/80 mm Hg, pulse is 115/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min. On physical exam, he is in acute distress due to the pain. Pulmonary auscultation reveals scattered wheezes and decreased air entry. His heart rate is irregularly irregular, with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdominal exam is significant for decreased bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation is as follows:
Na 138 mEq/L, Cl 101 mEq/L, HCO3 12 mEq/L, BUN 21 mg/dL, Cr 0.9 mg/dL, glucose 190 mg/dL, amylase 240 U/L (normal < 65 U/L).
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Acute mesenteric ischemia — most likely an embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. 

Reasoning: sudden severe abdominal pain in a patient with atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation, pain out of proportion to exam (diffuse tenderness, decreased bowel sounds), high anion-gap metabolic acidosis (consistent with lactic acidosis from gut ischemia), and elevated amylase (can occur with intestinal ischemia). These findings are classic for acute mesenteric ischemia.",Acute mesenteric ischemia,True,CORRECT
"A 33-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of repeated episodes of severe headache for the past 3 days. He is currently having his 2nd episode of the day. He usually has his first episode in the mornings. The pain is severe and localized to his right forehead and right eye. He had similar symptoms last summer. He works as an analyst for a large hedge fund management company and spends the majority of his time at the computer. He has been under a lot of stress because of overdue paperwork. He also has chronic shoulder pain. He has been using indomethacin every 6 hours for the pain but has had no relief. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. He appears restless. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows drooping of the right eyelid, tearing of the right eye, and rhinorrhea. The right pupil is 2 mm and the left pupil is 4 mm. There is localized tenderness to his right supraspinatus muscle. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Cluster headache. 

Reason: severe unilateral periorbital pain with ipsilateral lacrimation, rhinorrhea, ptosis and miosis, restless behavior during attacks, male smoker in his 30s with morning/seasonal pattern — classic trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia. Lack of response to indomethacin also argues against paroxysmal hemicrania.",Cluster headache,True,CORRECT
"A 27-year-old-man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being involved in a motorcycle accident. He lost control at high speed and was thrown forward onto the handlebars. On arrival, he is alert and responsive. He has abdominal pain and superficial lacerations on his left arm. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a tender, erythematous area over his epigastrium. The abdomen is soft and non-distended. A CT scan of the abdomen shows no abnormalities. Treatment with analgesics is begun, the lacerations are cleaned and dressed, and the patient is discharged home after 2 hours of observation. Four days later, the patient returns to the emergency department with gradually worsening upper abdominal pain, fever, poor appetite, and vomiting. His pulse is 91/min and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Traumatic pancreatitis from a pancreatic injury (eg, pancreatic contusion/duct injury from blunt epigastric trauma). Classic delayed epigastric pain, vomiting and fever after handlebar-type trauma; initial CT can be normal early.",Pancreatic ductal injury,True,CORRECT
"A 33-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for sudden joint pain. She states that the pain started several hours ago and has been worsening.

She reports that these “nightmares” happen when she is asleep and also sometimes when she is awake, but she cannot come up with another description for them. The episodes have been happening for at least 3 weeks now. She states that when it happens she feels “outside of her body,” like she’s “watching myself.” She also reports some chronic fatigue. The patient denies headaches, vision changes, dizziness, or loss in sensation or motor function. She has no notable medical or surgical history. She takes a multivitamin every day. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day but denies alcohol or illicit drug use. The patient appears slightly anxious but is in no acute distress. A physical and neurological exam is normal. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation. What is the most likely diagnosis for the patient’s symptoms?","Most likely diagnosis: depersonalization/derealization disorder.

Rationale: she describes recurrent episodes of feeling detached from herself/“outside of my body” with preserved insight, normal neuro exam, no substance or medical cause, and symptoms persisting for weeks. This pattern is classic for depersonalization/derealization rather than psychosis, primary sleep disorder, or neurological disease.",Depersonalization disorder,False,WRONG
A 23-year-old man presents with sudden loss of consciousness while pitching in a baseball game. There is no history of injury. Consciousness is regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Past medical history is negative for any neurological and cardiovascular problems. Physical examination reveals a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse. There are no audible murmurs. An S4 is present. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis). The sustained/double apical impulse and S4 indicate a hypertrophied, stiff ventricle, and HCM is a classic cause of exertional syncope/sudden death in young athletes.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,True,CORRECT
"A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a skin lesion. He is concerned because it has persisted for several days without improvement. The patient has a past medical history of alcohol abuse, intravenous drug abuse, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and depression.

There is tenderness to palpation in the area between the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, and extensor pollicis longus muscle. The thumb can be opposed actively towards the other fingers. Muscle strength of the right hand is decreased. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Scaphoid fracture.

Rationale: FOOSH injury with focal tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox (between APL/EPB and EPL tendons) and decreased grip strength is classic for a scaphoid fracture. Initial x-rays can be falsely negative — immobilize in a thumb-spica splint and obtain repeat imaging (or MRI/CT) because of risk of nonunion and avascular necrosis of the proximal pole.",Scaphoid fracture,True,CORRECT
"A 17-year-old girl suddenly grabs her chest and collapses to the ground while playing volleyball at school. The teacher rushes to evaluate the situation and finds that the girl has no pulse and is not breathing. He starts chest compressions. An automated external defibrillator (AED) is brought to the scene within 3 minutes and a shock is delivered. The girl regains consciousness and regular sinus rhythm. She is rushed to the emergency department. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/77 mm Hg and pulse 65/min. The pulse is regular. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a shortened PR interval, a wide QRS complex, a delta wave, and an inverted T wave.

A physical examination demonstrates a patient in acute distress with diffuse abdominal tenderness and decreased sensation of the hands bilaterally. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?","Acute intermittent porphyria due to deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (hydroxymethylbilane synthase) in heme synthesis → accumulation of ALA and porphobilinogen. Triggered by alcohol/drugs, it causes severe neurovisceral abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathies (paresthesias), autonomic signs (HTN, tachycardia) and dark/painless urine.",Mutation of the porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme,True,CORRECT
"A 9-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother for weakness, diaphoresis, and syncope. His mother says that he has never been diagnosed with any medical conditions but has been having “fainting spells” over the past month. Routine lab work reveals a glucose level of 25 mg/dL. The patient is promptly given glucagon and intravenous dextrose and admitted to the hospital for observation. The patient’s mother stays with him during his hospitalization. The patient is successfully watched overnight and his blood glucose levels normalize on his morning levels. The care team discusses a possible discharge during morning rounds. One hour later the nurse is called in for a repeat fainting episode. A c-peptide level is drawn and shown to be low. The patient appears ill, diaphoretic, and is barely arousable. What is the most likely diagnosis in this child?","Most likely: factitious disorder imposed on another (Munchausen syndrome by proxy) — the child is being given exogenous insulin by the caregiver. 

Rationale: profound hypoglycemia with a low C‑peptide indicates exogenous insulin rather than endogenous hyperinsulinism. The episodes occurring while the mother is present and resolving under observation support caregiver‑induced illness. This is a medical emergency and requires safeguarding/child‑protective intervention.",Munchausen syndrome by proxy,True,CORRECT
"Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catheterization for unstable angina pectoris, a 65-year-old man has decreased urinary output.

Urgent IV antibiotics and neurosurgical/ENT evaluation are required.",Infection posterior to the orbital septum,False,WRONG
"A 36-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her husband for “weird behavior"" for the past several weeks. He reports that her right arm has been moving uncontrollably in a writhing movement and that she has been especially irritable. She has a history of depression, which was diagnosed 4 years ago and is currently being treated with sertraline. She denies any recent fever, trauma, infections, travel, weakness, or sensory changes. She was adopted so is unsure of her family history. What is the most likely explanation for her symptoms?","Most likely Huntington disease — an autosomal‑dominant CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene causing degeneration of striatal (caudate/putamen) GABAergic neurons. That produces progressive chorea and psychiatric symptoms (depression, irritability); family history may be obscured by adoption and the disorder shows anticipation (worse with paternal transmission).",CAG triplet expansion on chromosome 4,True,CORRECT
A 34-year-old man comes to the physician with a 2-month history of difficulty concentrating at work. He is worried he may lose his job due to poor performance. He feels constantly tired but attributes his fatigue to waking up early most mornings and being unable to fall back asleep. His wife has noticed that he has been speaking more slowly than usual and his appetite has decreased. He used to enjoy dance classes with her but has not been as interested in this recently. He is a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"Major depressive disorder — current major depressive episode. 

He has >2 months of depressed mood/interest (loss of interest in activities), poor concentration, early-morning insomnia, fatigue, psychomotor slowing, and decreased appetite, meeting criteria for MDD.",Major depressive disorder,True,CORRECT
"A 7-year-old child with a history of abdominal and thigh pain that runs in his family is brought into the emergency room by his mother. His mother states they have a ""blood disease."" She also states the child was coughing and had fever to 101.1 F over the last three days and has been suddenly feeling much worse. On exam, the vitals are HR 110, BP 100/60, RR 20, T 101.5 F. CBC is significant for Hgb 3.2, WBC 2.1, Hct 10, Plts 30000. The reticulocyte count is 1% and the MCV is 81. Bone marrow biopsy shows hypocellular marrow with fatty tissue. What is the most likely diagnosis?","This is aplastic anemia (bone marrow aplasia) — acute marrow failure with hypocellular, fatty marrow causing pancytopenia (likely an acquired/viral-induced aplastic crisis in this child).",Aplastic anemia,True,CORRECT
"An otherwise healthy 31-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a several-day history of sharp, central chest pain, which is constant and unrelated to exertion. The pain gets worse on lying down and decreases with sitting forward. He has smoked 10–15 cigarettes daily for the past 7 years. His blood pressure is 120/50 mm Hg, the pulse is 92/min, and the temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F). On physical examination, a scratching sound is heard at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. ECG is shown in the image. Serum troponin is mildly elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Acute pericarditis — most likely viral (myopericarditis). Presentation and exam (pleuritic chest pain worse supine, better sitting forward, pericardial friction rub) plus diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG and mild troponin rise are classic.",Acute pericarditis,True,CORRECT
"A 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with an abnormal appearance of her eye. The patient states she noticed several days ago, and she has some minor pain and double vision as well. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension and is not currently taking any medications. She is currently sexually active with 2 male partners. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 222 mg/dL
HbA1c: 12.8%
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Physical exam is notable for the finding in Figure A. The patient's physical exam is notable for 5/5 strength in the upper and lower extremities with 2+ reflexes throughout. Sensation and proprioception are diminished in a bilateral fashion which the patient states has been gradually occurring over the past several years. Both pupils are equal and reactive to light. What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s symptoms?","Ischemic (microvascular) oculomotor nerve palsy from uncontrolled diabetes — a pupil-sparing CN III infarct. Longstanding diabetic small‑vessel disease injures the central somatic fibers causing ptosis and ""down‑and‑out"" diplopia while sparing the peripheral parasympathetic fibers (pupillary reflex), unlike a compressive lesion (eg, aneurysm).",Diabetes mellitus,True,CORRECT
"A 25-year-old man is brought into the hospital by his family because they are concerned that he has post-traumatic stress disorder. The patient is a marine and was deployed to Afghanistan 2 years ago. He was able to successfully reintegrate with society upon his return; however, for the last 2 weeks, he has been having recurrent nightmares and avoiding news coverage on the war. He has become more and more detached from his family and friends and, on the few times he does interact with them, he has angry outbursts. The patient is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. What findings is most important in correctly diagnosing this patient’s condition?",Duration of symptoms: PTSD requires symptoms persisting for >1 month after the traumatic event. At 2 weeks this would be acute stress disorder; persistence beyond 1 month would support PTSD.,Duration of symptoms,True,CORRECT
"A 3-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a fever and a rash. This morning the patient was irritable and had a fever which gradually worsened throughout the day. He also developed a rash prior to presentation. He was previously healthy and is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 102.0°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg, pulse is 160/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a scarlatiniform rash with flaccid blisters that rupture easily, covering more than 60% of the patient’s body surface. The lesions surround the mouth but do not affect the mucosa, and palpation of the rash is painful. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). 
Young age, scarlatiniform rash with widespread flaccid bullae and painful, Nikolsky‑positive skin, perioral involvement with mucosal sparing, and preceding fever all point to SSSS (exfoliative toxin cleaving desmoglein‑1).",Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome,True,CORRECT
"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of facial swelling that has now progressed to total body swelling. He also complains of nausea and abdominal pain. The child was in his usual state of health a week ago when they first notice swelling around his eyes. A few days later his legs started to swell.

Today, his blood pressure is 104/60 mm Hg, the heart rate is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 25/min, and the temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F). On examination, he has facial edema, abdominal shifting dullness, and bilateral leg edema up to the knees. Urine dipstick shows 4+ protein and urinalysis shows fatty casts. Serum albumin is 2.2 g/dL. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?","This is nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease — caused by T-cell–mediated release of a circulating permeability factor that injures podocytes, producing diffuse foot-process effacement and selective albuminuria.",Minimal change disease,True,CORRECT
"A 17-month-old girl was brought to the emergency department by her mom following a fall. The mom reports that the patient was playing in the playground when she tripped and fell onto the mulch. She had an uncomplicated birth history and has been meeting developmental goals except for language delay, for which she is to receive a hearing test for further evaluation next week. Physical exam reveals bruising along the left lateral thigh, knee, and elbow; all lab tests are within normal limits. Radiograph shows a fracture of the olecranon. Serum chemistry and liver panels were within normal limits. What is the most likely explanation for the patient’s presentation?",Osteogenesis imperfecta — an autosomal dominant defect in type I collagen (COL1A1/COL1A2) causing brittle bones with fractures after minimal trauma and associated hearing loss. Normal basic labs and the planned hearing evaluation support this diagnosis.,Defective type 1 collagen gene,False,WRONG
"A 47-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with ongoing dyspnea and confusion for 2 hours. She has a history of psychosis and alcohol abuse. She has smoked 1 pack per day for 25 years.

The classic cause producing both early respiratory alkalosis and anion‑gap metabolic acidosis is acute salicylate (aspirin) intoxication — the best explanation given her presentation and risk factors.,Salicylate intoxication,True,CORRECT
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 and is subsequently intubated. Physical exam is notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area. Needle decompression and chest tube placement are performed, and the patient is stabilized after receiving 2 units of blood and 2 liters of fluid. Chest radiography demonstrates proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient is transferred to the trauma intensive care unit. On the unit, a repeat chest radiograph is notable for a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube in place. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Traumatic tracheobronchial (major airway) rupture — most commonly a mainstem bronchus injury.  
Rationale: blunt deceleration injury with subcutaneous/mediastinal emphysema and a pneumothorax that recurs/persists despite a correctly placed chest tube is classic for bronchial disruption with a persistent air leak.",Tracheobronchial rupture,True,CORRECT
"A previously healthy 28-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of dizziness and palpitations for 2 days. Prior to the onset of the symptoms, he attended a bachelor party where he lost several drinking games. An ECG is shown.

The stool is often loose and associated with blood and lower abdominal pain. She denies any recent travel history, and she works at a nursing home as a caretaker. She is not currently on any medications. Clinical examination shows mild tenderness in the suprapubic region, and there is no organomegaly. Findings on colonoscopy include patchy erythema and ulceration in the cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon. Mucosal biopsy shows colonic crypts with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely diagnosis: ulcerative colitis.

Reason: a young adult with chronic bloody diarrhea and mucosal ulceration plus biopsy showing cryptitis/crypt abscesses (lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltration of colonic crypts) is characteristic of ulcerative colitis. Crohn disease would more often show transmural inflammation, skip lesions and noncaseating granulomas.",Crohn’s disease,True,CORRECT
"A 34-year-old woman comes to the gynecologist complaining of vaginal swelling and discomfort. She states that over the past 2 weeks she has noticed swelling of her right labia. The swelling continued to grow in size and now causes her discomfort when walking. She denies abnormal discharge or bleeding from the swelling or from the vulva. She normally shaves the area, but with the recent pain, she has been unable to. She denies any history of known trauma. The patient is relatively healthy and takes only a multivitamin. She never received the vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV). On physical exam, there is a fluctuant, swelling of the right labia, most prominently at the posterior vestibule. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely a Bartholin gland cyst (or developing Bartholin abscess). The posterior vestibule/labial location, fluctuant unilateral swelling in a reproductive-aged woman is classic for obstruction/infection of the Bartholin gland.",Bartholin gland cyst,True,CORRECT

After illumination of the right eye and conceptual constriction of the pupils, illumination of the left eye shows pupillary dilation. A fundoscopy image is shown. What best explains these findings?","An acute central retinal artery occlusion from an embolus (eg, carotid atheroembolus) causing ischemia of the inner retina — seen as a pale retina with a cherry‑red spot on fundoscopy. The injured retina/optic nerve produces an afferent pupillary defect (no direct/consensual constriction when light is shone in the left eye).",Central retinal artery occlusion,True,CORRECT
"A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after an episode of hemoptysis. He has a chronic cough that is productive of copious sputum. Six years ago, he had a stroke that left him with difficulty swallowing. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years, but quit 2 years ago. His respirations are 25/min and labored. Physical examination shows digital clubbing. An x-ray of the chest shows tram track opacities in the lower lung fields. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Bronchiectasis — most likely from chronic aspiration (post-stroke dysphagia). The chronic copious sputum, hemoptysis, digital clubbing and “tram-track” bronchial wall thickening in the lower lobes are classic for bronchiectasis.",Bronchiectasis,True,CORRECT
"A 16-year-old teenage boy is brought to the emergency room for severe left groin pain. He reports feeling feverish this morning but insisted on going to his basketball practice this afternoon. Shortly after the practice, he began experiencing severe pain at his left groin that is described as sharp and burning in quality. The pain does not radiate anywhere. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, hematuria, or abnormal discharge, but endorses fever and chills. He is sexually active with his girlfriend and reports consistent condom use. Per his mom, last week he had “a weird flu episode” where his left cheek was swollen but resolved within 4 days. He did not seek medical attention as his mother preferred natural/holistic management; the patient is not vaccinated. A physical examination demonstrates a relatively healthy patient in acute distress and an erythematous, swollen left scrotum. A Doppler ultrasound of the testicles is obtained and shown in Figure A. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s presentation?","This is mumps orchitis — viral inflammation of the testis from mumps (a paramyxovirus) that classically follows parotitis in unvaccinated post‑pubertal males. The prior cheek swelling, lack of MMR immunization, fever, and unilateral swollen, erythematous scrotum point to mumps orchitis (Doppler shows hyperemia), not torsion (which would have absent/decreased flow).",Inflammation of the testicles due to a viral infection,True,CORRECT
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife for severe abdominal pain for the past 1 hour. He is unable to give more information about the nature of his pain. His wife says that he has peptic ulcer disease and is being treated with antacids without a good response. She adds that he vomited repeatedly  in the last couple of hours, his vomitus being brown/red in color. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. A physical exam reveals a tense abdomen with a board like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness. An erect abdominal x-ray is ordered. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Perforated peptic ulcer with pneumoperitoneum causing acute chemical peritonitis. Erect chest/abdomen x‑ray would show free air under the diaphragm.,Perforated gastric peptic ulcer,False,WRONG
A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of fatigue and yellowish discoloration of his eyes and skin. Physical examination shows mild right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. The course of different serum parameters over the following 4 months is shown. What is the most likely explanation for the course of this patient's laboratory findings?,"I don't have the laboratory-parameter graph you mention. Please upload the image or list the values/timeline for bilirubin, ALT/AST, and alkaline phosphatase over the 4 months. 

If helpful: common patterns to describe quickly—
- Marked early ALT/AST rise with subsequent fall and transient bilirubin rise = acute hepatocellular injury (eg, acute viral hepatitis or toxin-induced).
- Predominant alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin elevation = cholestatic or obstructive process.
- Mild chronic transaminase elevation over months = chronic hepatitis or fatty liver.",Resolved acute hepatitis B infection,True,CORRECT
"A 23-year-old woman presents to the emergency room for a self-inflicted laceration of her distal volar forearm. The patient states that she knew her husband was having sexual thoughts about the woman from the grocery store, prompting her decision to cut her own wrist.

She is grateful to you for her care and regrets her actions. Of note, the patient has presented to the emergency department before for a similar reason when she was struggling with online dating. The patient states that she struggles with her romantic relationship though she deeply desires them. On physical exam you note a frightened young woman who is wearing a revealing dress that prominently displays her breasts. You tell the patient that she will have to stay in the psychiatric emergency department for the night which makes her furious. What personality disorders is the most likely diagnosis?","Borderline personality disorder.

Rationale: recurrent, impulsive self‑harm/suicidal gestures, intense unstable/fragile relationships and fear of abandonment, labile affect and anger, rapidly shifting attitudes toward caregivers — all classic for borderline PD. (Histrionic features such as provocative dress may overlap, but the recurrent self‑injury and relationship instability point to borderline.)",Borderline,True,CORRECT
"A 7-year-old boy with a history of fetal alcohol syndrome is brought by his mother to the emergency room for malaise and lethargy. His mother reports that the family was on vacation in a cabin in the mountains for the past 10 days. Five days ago, the child developed a fever with a max temperature of 102.6°F (39.2°F). She also reports that he was given multiple medications to try to bring down his fever. Although his fever resolved two days ago, the child has become increasingly lethargic. He started having non-bilious, non-bloody emesis one day prior to presentation. His current temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 95/55 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. On exam, the child is lethargic and minimally reactive. Mild hepatomegaly is noted.

The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical exam, there is left-sided, lower abdominal tenderness and guarding. Pelvic examination is notable for clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa. A pelvic ultrasound with Doppler reveals a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ruptured ovarian (hemorrhagic) cyst — sudden unilateral pelvic pain precipitated by exertion with adnexal tenderness and hemoperitoneum (free fluid in the pouch of Douglas) in a reproductive‑age woman.,Ruptured ovarian cyst,False,WRONG
"A 40-year-old man presents with a rash, oral lesions, and vision problems for 5 days. He says the rash started as a burning feeling on his face and the upper part of his torso, but soon red spots appeared in that same distribution. The spots grew in size and spread to his upper extremities. The patient says the spots are painful but denies any associated pruritus. He says the painful oral lesions appeared about the same time as the rash. For the past 3 days, he also says he has been having double vision and dry, itchy eyes. He reports that he had a mild upper respiratory infection for a few days that preceded his current symptoms. The patient denies any chills, hematuria, abdominal or chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past.

Her boyfriend says that they have broken up 10 times in the past year because she is prone to outbursts of physical aggression as well as mood swings. He says that these mood swings last a few hours and can vary from states of “exuberance and affection” to states of “depression.” On examination, the patient appears well-dressed and calm. She has normal speech, thought processes, and thought content. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Borderline personality disorder. Her recurrent self-harm/impulsivity, unstable intense relationships, short-lived (hours) affective swings and attention-seeking/abandonment features are characteristic of BPD (vs bipolar disorder, whose mood episodes last days–weeks).",Borderline personality disorder,True,CORRECT
"A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after an episode of light-headedness. She was using the bathroom when she felt light-headed and fell to the floor. Her daughter found her and brought her into the emergency department right away. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and diabetes mellitus. She came to the emergency department 1 week ago for a similar complaint. The patient states that she has otherwise felt well with the exception of fatigue, constipation, an odd sensation in her chest, and a decreased appetite and desire to drink recently causing her to lose 10 pounds. Her temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 122/88 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a cardiopulmonary exam within normal limits and stable gait. The patient has an obese abdomen with abdominal distension. Strength is 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities. What is associated with the most likely diagnosis?","This presentation is most consistent with hypercalcemia from primary hyperparathyroidism (eg, parathyroid adenoma). It is associated with elevated PTH, hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia — classically with nephrolithiasis and subperiosteal bone resorption on x‑ray.",CA-125,False,WRONG
"A 71-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-month history of severe muscle cramps and back pain. He says that he is homeless and has not visited a physician in the past 20 years. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lb); BMI is 18.5 kg/m2. His blood pressure is 154/88 mm Hg.

Calcium 7.2 mg/dL
Phosphorus 5.1 mg/dL
Glucose 221 mg/dL
Creatinine 4.5 mg/dL
An x-ray of the spine shows alternating sclerotic and radiolucent bands in the lumbar and thoracic vertebral bodies. What is the most likely explanation for these findings?""","Chronic kidney disease → phosphate retention and decreased 1α‑hydroxylase activity → reduced 1,25(OH)2D (↓GI Ca2+ absorption) and hyperphosphatemia → hypocalcemia → secondary hyperparathyroidism. Excess PTH causes bone turnover/abnormal mineralization (renal osteodystrophy) producing the “rugger‑jersey” vertebral bands, bone pain, muscle cramps and the lab abnormalities.",Secondary hyperparathyroidism,True,CORRECT
"A 48-year-old homeless male presents to the ED because he hasn’t felt well recently. He states that he has been feeling nauseous and extremely weak over the past few days. He has several previous admissions for alcohol intoxication and uses heroin occasionally. His temperature is 100.9°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 127/89 mmHg, and pulse is 101/min.

What is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?","Chronic alcohol-induced liver injury — alcoholic hepatitis (acute-on-chronic alcoholic liver disease). The AST:ALT >2 ratio and markedly elevated GGT with signs of chronic liver disease (palmar erythema, gynecomastia, tender hepatomegaly) point to alcohol-mediated hepatocellular injury (acetaldehyde/mitochondrial damage and alcohol-related pyridoxine deficiency lowering ALT).",Alcoholic hepatitis,True,CORRECT
"A 10-year-old boy presents to the emergency department accompanied by his parents with a swollen and painful right knee after he fell from his bicycle a few hours ago. The patient’s mother says he fell off the bike and struck the ground with his whole weight on his right knee. Immediately, his right knee swelled significantly, and he experienced severe pain. The patient’s past medical history is significant for previous episodes of easy bruising that manifest as small bluish spots, but not nearly as severe. The family history is significant for an uncle who had similar symptoms, and who was diagnosed at the age of 13 years old. The patient is afebrile, and the vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, a large bruise is present over the right knee that is extending several inches down the leg. The right tibiofemoral joint is warm to the touch and severely tender to palpation. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Most likely hemarthrosis from hemophilia A (X-linked factor VIII deficiency). The boy’s male sex, family history (affected maternal uncle), easy bruising, and acute large joint bleed after trauma are classic for hemophilia causing a painful, swollen knee.",Hemophilia A,True,CORRECT
"A 27-year-old new patient presents to the physician’s office with complaints of burning, upper abdominal pain for the past 6 months. The pain does not radiate and is only partially relieved by eating small meals, over the counter antacids, and PPI. He previously underwent upper endoscopy that revealed small ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. He had to relocate across the country before he could receive proper treatment or further workup. He also complains of constipation and urinary frequency. His mother has a history of peptic ulcer disease and recurrent kidney stones. Vital signs are normal. On physical examination, the patient is alert and not under distress. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness with no rebounding. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. A fecal occult blood test is positive. Laboratory results are as follows:

Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL
CRP: 5.2 mg/L

Further imaging is currently pending. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Most likely diagnosis: spinal (epidural) abscess from hematogenous seeding (most commonly Staphylococcus aureus).

Rationale: IV drug use, fever, focal severe thoracolumbar back pain with vertebral tenderness and leukocytosis/raised inflammatory marker — classic presentation of an epidural abscess. This requires urgent MRI of the spine, blood cultures, and prompt IV antibiotics ± neurosurgical decompression.",Spinal epidural abscess,False,WRONG
"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric emergency department by his parents with a complaint of abdominal pain and diarrhea for the past week. He states that for the past two days, he has noticed blood in his stool. His parents note that they attended a neighbor’s barbecue last weekend, but otherwise have not eaten any new foods or changed their usual diet. The patient is admitted to the hospital unit for further work-up. The provider team finds that the patient’s blood is positive for Shiga-like toxin and notes the following lab values: creatinine of 4.2 mg/dL, platelet count of 50,000/mm^3, and hemoglobin of 6.0 g/dL. What additional lab findings would be consistent with the diagnosis?","Findings of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia — e.g. schistocytes on peripheral smear, elevated LDH, elevated indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, increased reticulocyte count, and a negative direct Coombs test.",Microthrombi within glomerular vessels on kidney biopsy,False,WRONG
"A 45-year-old man presents to the clinic for the third time in the past 3 weeks asking for an MRI of his lower back. He had initially gone to the gym as advised by his wife and had started doing some back exercises. The next day, he developed soreness in his lower back and spent the whole day online trying to figure out what was wrong with him. He has been to the emergency department a few times and subsequently has been redirected to the clinic where each time he was thoroughly examined and investigated for all the possible causes. The patient still exhibits worry and would like to get an MRI to make sure everything is ‘okay.’ What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Most likely diagnosis: illness anxiety disorder (formerly hypochondriasis). 

Rationale: persistent preoccupation with having a serious illness despite minimal symptoms and repeated reassurance/negative evaluations, with excessive health‑seeking (repeated ED/clinic visits and requests for MRI).",Illness anxiety disorder,False,WRONG
"A 34-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of numbness and tingling of her right arm for 2 days. She reports that she was washing dishes when she felt a burning sensation along her right forearm. The patient has been relatively healthy except for an episode of right eye pain and vision loss 4 years ago. She does not recall specific details but claims that “it just went away on its own after a couple of days.” The patient denies any recent travel, trauma, loss of consciousness, speech changes, weakness, or vision change but does endorse gastroenteritis about 1 week ago. She is sexually active with multiple partners and rarely uses contraception. Her last HIV testing 2 weeks ago was negative. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of her brain is shown in Figure A. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?","This presentation is most consistent with multiple sclerosis. The prior transient optic neuritis and the new focal sensory symptoms separated in time and space, plus the MRI (typical periventricular white‑matter plaques/Dawson fingers), point to an autoimmune T‑cell–mediated demyelination of CNS oligodendrocytes causing focal conduction block. (Supportive test: oligoclonal IgG bands in CSF.)",Destruction of oligodendrocytes by T-cells,False,WRONG
"A 23-year-old man comes to the emergency department for 2 days of severe headaches. The pain is most intense on his left forehead and eye. He had similar symptoms last summer. He has been taking indomethacin every 6 hours for the last 24 hours but has not had any relief. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years. He works as an accountant and describes his work as very stressful. Physical examination shows drooping of the left eyelid, tearing of the left eye, and rhinorrhea. The left pupil is 2 mm and the right pupil is 4 mm. There is localized tenderness along the right supraspinatus muscle. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Cluster headache (trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia). 

Rationale: recurrent, severe unilateral periorbital/head pain in a young male smoker with ipsilateral autonomic signs (ptosis/miosis, tearing, rhinorrhea) — classic for cluster headache. Lack of response to indomethacin makes paroxysmal hemicrania unlikely.",Cluster headache,True,CORRECT
"A 23-year-old man presents to the emergency department with bloody vomitus. The patient is an alcoholic and has presented similarly before. He is given ondansetron; however, he continues to vomit. The patient complains of sudden substernal chest pain and dysphagia after another bout of vomiting. His temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 117/60 mmHg, pulse is 122/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an uncomfortable man with subcutaneous emphysema in the patient’s neck and supraclavicular areas. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Boerhaave syndrome — spontaneous transmural esophageal rupture after forceful vomiting, producing chest pain, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema.",Esophageal rupture,True,CORRECT
A 57-year-old man with HIV and GERD comes to the emergency department because of productive cough with malodorous phlegm and night sweats for the past week. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years and he drinks 8–10 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F).

His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and azithromycin. He has no sign of injury, and he appears well. During the examination, he loses consciousness again. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?","Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes) from drug‑induced QT prolongation — most likely azithromycin blocking the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr), prolonging repolarization and precipitating torsades with transient syncope.",Prolonged QT interval,True,CORRECT
"A 66-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of shortness of breath. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) and pulse is 105/min. When the blood pressure cuff is inflated to 140 mm Hg, the patient's pulse is audible and regular. However, upon inspiration, the pulse disappears and does not reappear until expiration. Only when the blood pressure cuff is inflated to 125 mm Hg is the pulse audible throughout the entire respiratory cycle. What underlying conditions is most likely responsible for this patient's physical examination findings?",This is pulsus paradoxus (inspiratory fall in systolic BP >10 mm Hg). The most likely underlying cause is cardiac tamponade from a pericardial effusion — impaired LV filling (exaggerated RV filling and septal shift during inspiration) leading to the large inspiratory drop in systolic pressure.,Asthma,False,WRONG
"A 31-year-old man comes to the emergency department for acute tearing chest pain that radiates to the back. Despite appropriate therapy, the patient dies. Autopsy shows an increase in mucoid extracellular matrix and loss of smooth muscle cell nuclei in the media of large arteries.

"A 67-year-old woman is brought to the clinic by her husband for changes in personality. He reports that 3 years ago she began to forget day-to-day things (e.g., where her keys are and the directions home). She would intermittently forget who her friends are and put the remote in the refrigerator. Recently, the husband noticed stark changes in her personality as she is more impatient, aggressive, and sometimes violent. She denies any fever, trauma, focal neurologic deficits, or sensory changes. Her past medical history is significant for diabetes and hypertension for which she takes metformin and lisinopril, respectively. A physical examination is unremarkable.

"A 61-year-old man with schizophrenia in a locked inpatient psychiatry unit was observed making an unusual smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits. What accurately describes his symptoms?","These are classic tardive dyskinesia: involuntary, repetitive oro‑bucco‑lingual movements (lip smacking, pursing, blinking) that arise after months of D2‑blocking antipsychotic exposure. Pathophysiology is thought to be dopamine D2 receptor upregulation/supersensitivity from chronic blockade. TD often develops insidiously, may be only mildly bothersome to the patient, and can be persistent or irreversible; management includes reducing/switching the antipsychotic (eg, to clozapine) and/or using VMAT2 inhibitors (deutetrabenazine/valbenazine).",Tardive dyskinesia,True,CORRECT

These episodes occur once every few days and the most recent one happened about 10 minutes before the patient arrived to the emergency department. On arrival, the patient is mildly confused and does not know where he is or what recently happened. He is slow to respond to questions and appears tired. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","Most likely diagnosis: complex partial seizures (focal seizures with impaired awareness), most consistent with temporal‑lobe epilepsy.

Reasoning: episodes last 1–2 minutes with automatisms (lip‑smacking, hand clasping), eyes open but unresponsive, and a prolonged postictal confusion—features that distinguish them from brief absence seizures.",Complex partial seizure,True,CORRECT
"A 43-year-old type 1 diabetic woman who is poorly compliant with her diabetes medications presented to the emergency department with hemorrhage from her nose. On exam, you observe the findings shown in figure A. What is the most likely explanation for these findings?","Rhinocerebral mucormycosis (Mucor/Rhizopus) — an angioinvasive fungus that infects poorly controlled diabetics (especially in DKA). The organisms (broad, nonseptate hyphae with right‑angle branching) invade vessels causing thrombosis and tissue infarction → necrotic/black eschars of the nasal/oral mucosa.",Rhizopus infection,True,CORRECT
"A 61-year-old woman presents to the urgent care unit with a 2-week history of abdominal pain after meals. The patient reports vomiting over the past few days. The past medical history is significant for osteoarthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. She regularly drinks alcohol. She does not smoke cigarettes. The patient currently presents with vital signs within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in moderate distress, but she is alert and oriented.

Briefly: Mycoplasma produces cold agglutinins that agglutinate RBCs at low temps, causing hemolysis and lab artifacts; it classically causes a nonproductive cough, sore throat, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates.",Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection,False,WRONG
"A 68-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism presents to the emergency room with 6 months of worsening headaches and vision changes. Initially, her headaches were dull and infrequent, but they now occur daily and have become quite severe. She states that her symptoms are worse in the morning. They do not improve substantially with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. The patient requests prescription medication as she can no longer tolerate the pain. She has also been experiencing fatigue, nausea, increased thirst, and frequent urination. Her current medications include insulin, metformin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and levothyroxine. She confirms that she has been taking all her medications as prescribed. She also reveals that her peripheral vision has been getting worse, though she thinks this may be due to old age. Her temperature is 97.9°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 139/89 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for mild impairment of her lateral visual fields. A non-contrast CT scan of the head is performed and shown in Figure A. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension compressing the optic chiasm (producing bitemporal hemianopsia). Morning headaches, progressive peripheral visual loss, and the sellar/suprasellar mass on CT are most consistent with a macroadenoma.",Craniopharyngioma,True,CORRECT
"A 4-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother with fever and a rash. The patient’s mother says his symptoms started 1 week ago with the acute onset of fever and a runny nose, which resolved over the next 3 days.

"An 18-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her mother for vaginal bleeding. The mother states that she noticed the bleeding today, which appeared as brown discharge with clots in the patient’s diaper. The mother denies frequent nosebleeds or easy bruising. She also denies any known trauma. She does mention that the patient has been limping and complaining of left leg pain since a fall 2 months ago. On physical exam, there are multiple 2-3 cm hyperpigmented patches on the patient’s trunk. There is bilateral enlargement of the breasts but no pubic hair. The vaginal orifice is normal and clear with an intact hymen. A plain radiograph of the left lower leg shows patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis. What is associated with the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",Findings fit McCune–Albright syndrome — polyostotic fibrous dysplasia + café‑au‑lait spots + peripheral precocious puberty. It is due to a postzygotic activating mutation in Gsα (GNAS) causing constitutive adenylate cyclase → ↑cAMP (somatic mosaicism).,Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia,False,WRONG
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. He states that for the past month ever since starting a new job he has experienced an episode of syncope or near-syncope every morning while he is getting dressed. The patient states that he now gets dressed, shaves, and puts on his tie sitting down to avoid falling when he faints. He has never had this before and is concerned it is stress from his new job as he has been unemployed for the past 5 years. He is wondering if he can get a note for work since he was unable to head in today secondary to his presentation. The patient has no significant past medical history and is otherwise healthy. His temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 122/83 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Cardiopulmonary and neurologic exams are within normal limits. An initial ECG and laboratory values are unremarkable as well. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (carotid sinus syndrome) — a reflex-mediated syncope triggered by pressure/manipulation of the carotid sinus (eg, tight collar/tie, shaving). Normal ECG/labs and the consistent morning episodes with shaving/putting on a tie strongly point to this diagnosis.",Carotid hypersensitivity syndrome,False,WRONG
"A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was the back seat restrained passenger in a vehicle that was rear ended at 25 miles/hour.

In tamponade, pericardial fluid restricts diastolic filling producing near-equalization of diastolic pressures in all chambers.",Tamponade,True,CORRECT
"A 66-year-old man is brought into the emergency department by his daughter for a change in behavior. Yesterday the patient seemed more confused than usual and was asking the same questions repetitively. His symptoms have not improved over the past 24 hours, thus the decision to bring him in today. Last year, the patient was almost completely independent but he then suffered a ""series of falls,"" after which his ability to care for himself declined. After this episode he was no longer able to cook for himself or pay his bills but otherwise had been fine up until this episode. The patient has a past medical history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, depression, diabetes mellitus type II, constipation, diverticulitis, and peripheral neuropathy. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, sodium docusate, atorvastatin, metoprolol, fluoxetine, and gabapentin.

What is the best explanation for the most likely diagnosis?","The CT and classic ""thunderclap"" headache indicate a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a saccular (berry) aneurysm. Berry aneurysms arise at arterial branch points in the circle of Willis from a congenital defect/weakness in the vessel wall (loss of tunica media/internal elastic lamina), and can rupture with hemodynamic stress (eg, Valsalva, hypertension).",Rupture of a berry aneurysm,False,WRONG
"A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after having been hit by a car while riding his bicycle. He was not wearing a helmet. Despite appropriate life-saving measures, he dies 2 hours later because of a severe intracranial hemorrhage. Autopsy of the heart shows general thickening of the left ventricular wall with narrowing of the ventricular chamber. What conditions is the most likely underlying cause of the described cardiac changes?","Long-standing systemic (essential) hypertension — chronic pressure overload causes concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (parallel sarcomere addition → thickened wall, small chamber).",Chronic hypertension,True,CORRECT
"A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for erectile dysfunction. He states that for the past month he has been unable to engage in sexual intercourse with his wife despite having appropriate sexual desire. He also endorses deep and burning buttock and hip pain when walking, which is relieved by rest. The patient states that he does not have erections at night or in the morning. His past medical history is notable for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, and he has a 40 pack-year smoking history.
