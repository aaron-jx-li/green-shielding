Results from first-trimester laboratory test are provided below. Screening for depression and intimate partner violence is negative. In addition to ordering a complete blood count (CBC), type and screen (T&S), and urine culture, which additional test or interventions are recommended at this visit? | **Test** | **Result** | | --- | --- | | Blood type | A-negative | | Antibody screen | Negative | | CBC | Within normal limits | | Urine culture | 10,000 CFU group B *Streptococcus* (GBS) | | Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) | Within normal limits | | Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) | Negative | | Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) | Non-reactive | | Hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg) | Negative | | Rubella | Non-immune | | Varicella | Immune |?","Recommend three things now:

1. Give Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) at 28 weeks (patient is Rh‑negative and unsensitized).  
2. Administer Tdap vaccine now (recommended at 27–36 weeks each pregnancy to protect the newborn).  
3. Document GBS colonization (urine grew group B strep) and plan intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IV penicillin during labor; use an appropriate alternative if penicillin‑allergic).

Also counsel that because rubella serology is nonimmune, MMR vaccination should be given postpartum (not during pregnancy).","OGTT, anti-D immune globulin, TDaP vaccine",False,True

Her past medical history is significant for 3 prior uncomplicated cesarean births with tubal sterilization during her last birth. Vital sign are within normal limits, and body mass index is 22 kg/m2. Pelvic exam shows a 10-week-sized boggy uterus with smooth contours that is mildly tender to palpation. No discrete masses are palpable, and the adnexa are nontender. A urine pregnancy test is negative, and serum bloodwork shows mild anemia. A pelvic ultrasound is ordered. Which finding would confirm the most likely diagnosis?","Findings consistent with adenomyosis — a diffusely enlarged, heterogeneous myometrium with an indistinct endometrial–myometrial junction and small myometrial (anechoic) cysts on transvaginal ultrasound.",Circular anechoic structures within the myometrium without posterior shadowing,True,False

Physical examination finding are unremarkable. What is the next best step in managing this patient’s condition?","Repeat and quantify the proteinuria — obtain a first‑morning urine and measure a urine albumin‑to‑creatinine (or protein‑to‑creatinine) ratio (and check serum creatinine/eGFR). 

Rationale: dipstick 3+ may be transient; you should confirm persistent significant proteinuria and quantify it before further workup or referral.",Repeating the urine dipstick test,True,True
720,"A 32-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 3-week history of midthoracic pain that is localized to the area between the shoulder blades.

Structural examination reveals a prominent left transverse process that becomes more prominent in flexion. The spinous process of the affected vertebra is palpated halfway between the transverse processes of T6 and T7. The most likely diagnosis is?",Segmental rotation of T6 to the left (T6 rotated left) — a left-rotated thoracic vertebra causing a posteriorly prominent left transverse process.,"T6 extended, rotated left, sidebent left",False,True
546,"A 26-year-old man arrives at the emergency department with complaints of fatigue and dark-colored urine over the past day.

Physical examination reveals a grade III/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla, along with several painful, red nodules on her fingers.

That pregnancy resulted in a healthy male infant with AB-positive blood type. What should be the next step in managing this patient's care?","No specific treatment now. Anti-I and anti‑Lea are typically cold, IgM antibodies (Lewis and cold agglutinins) that do not cause hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn. She is not alloimmunized to D, so continue routine prenatal care, obtain/confirm the father's Rh(D) status if desired, and administer routine Rh(D) immune globulin prophylaxis at 28 weeks (and postpartum if the infant is Rh(D)+).",No further evaluation is indicated,True,False
