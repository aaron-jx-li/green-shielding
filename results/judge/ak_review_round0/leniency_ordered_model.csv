249,"A 36-year-old G2P2 female seeks medical attention for severe menstrual symptom persisting for 8 months. She experiences heavy menstrual flow requiring 6-8 pads daily during her 5-6 day periods, which occur regularly every 28 days. She reports intense pelvic cramping beginning 2 days before menstruation, with minimal relief from naproxen. These symptom recently led to job loss from her position as a janitor. Her medical history includes tubal sterilization one year ago and two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. She maintains a monogamous sexual relationship with her spouse and takes only a daily multivitamin. She has a 15-pack-year smoking history. Physical measurements show: height 165 cm, weight 68 kg, BMI 25 kg/m2. Vital sign, physical examination including pelvic exam, complete blood count, thyroid function test, coagulation studies, and transvaginal ultrasound are all normal. What is the most appropriate next step in management?","Insert a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena). 

Rationale: LNG-IUS is first-line for heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea (likely adenomyosis/structural cause despite normal TVUS), markedly reduces bleeding and pain, and is preferable to combined OCPs in a 36-year-old smoker. Endometrial biopsy or MRI are not indicated given regular cycles and normal initial evaluation; hysterectomy is reserved if medical therapy fails.",Endometrial ablation,False,False
794,"A 63-year-old female presents with a 3-month history of progressively worsening pain in her right calf. She notes that the pain begins after walking for approximately 10 minutes and resolves with rest. Her medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and she takes lisinopril and simvastatin daily. She has a 34-year history of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day. Her pulse is 78/min, and her blood pressure is 142/96 mm Hg. On examination, femoral and popliteal pulses are 2+ bilaterally, left pedal pulses are 1+, and right pedal pulses are absent. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) is 0.65 in the right leg and 0.9 in the left leg. Which complications is this patient most at risk of developing?","This presentation is peripheral arterial disease (ABI 0.65). She is at high risk for both local and systemic atherosclerotic complications: locally — progression to critical limb ischemia with nonhealing arterial ulcers, gangrene and possible limb loss/amputation; systemically — major adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.",Acute myocardial infarction,False,False
740,"A 67-year-old man arrives at the emergency department experiencing acute dyspnea and epigastric discomfort. His medical history includes GERD, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, anxiety, glaucoma, and IBS. His medication regimen consists of omeprazole, insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and as-needed clonazepam. Initial vital sign show: temperature 99.5°F (37.5°C), heart rate 112/min, blood pressure 90/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 18/min, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally and notable jugular venous distention, with unremarkable cardiac auscultation. Following fluid bolus administration, his heart rate decreases to 80/min and blood pressure improves to 105/75 mmHg. After initiating treatment with beta-blockers, oxygen, nitroglycerin, morphine, IV fluids, and aspirin, his blood pressure drops to 80/65 mmHg. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for this blood pressure decrease following medication administration?","Most likely: reduction in preload (venodilation from nitroglycerin and morphine) in a preload‑dependent right ventricular infarction, with added loss of compensatory tachycardia/contractility from the beta‑blocker. The venodilation decreased RV filling → lower LV preload and cardiac output, causing the BP drop.",Increased cGMP,False,False
854,"A 16-year-old female presents with her mother for evaluation of a 3-month history of abdominal cramping, fatigue, and polyuria. She has no significant past medical history and takes only a daily multivitamin. Her family history is notable for type 2 diabetes in her mother and polycystic ovary syndrome in her maternal aunt. She is an excellent student and actively participates in school sports. She reports primary amenorrhea. Physical examination reveals: height 150 cm, weight 50 kg, BMI 22 kg/m2, normal vital sign, a grade 2/6 early systolic murmur that increases with inspiration best heard over the pulmonic area, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and Tanner stage 5 breast and pubic hair development. What is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test?",A urine pregnancy test (urine β-hCG). Rule out pregnancy as the initial test in any adolescent with amenorrhea and abdominal symptoms.,Serum β-hCG,False,False
165,"A 33-year-old man arrives at the emergency department following a motor vehicle collision in which he was the unrestrained driver and sustained significant trauma to his left arm, which was outside the car window during the crash. The patient reports pain in his elbow and arm. He has no prior medical history and is not on any medication. Vital sign are as follows: temperature 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure 123/82 mmHg, pulse 88/min, respirations 15/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. On examination, there is tenderness over the humerus and elbow with weakness in wrist extension, but the left upper extremity has a full, painless range of motion. Radiographs reveal a mid-shaft humeral fracture and a small, non-displaced olecranon fracture. The patient is admitted to the medical floor. On hospital day 14, he reports a ""pins and needles"" sensation in his hand, numbness over the ring and little fingers of the left hand, and mild atrophy of the interossei muscles. What is the most likely cause of his current symptom?","Compression/entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow (cubital tunnel) from prolonged pressure/immobilization (eg, tight splint/cast or prolonged elbow flexion).  

Rationale: sensory loss in the ring/little fingers and intrinsic-interossei atrophy localize to the ulnar nerve; the delayed onset favors a compressive neuropathy from positioning or immobilization rather than an acute transection from the fractures.",Traumatic elbow injury,False,False
587,"A child is brought to the general practitioner with a three-day history of cough and runny nose. Yesterday, the child developed a fever but remains energetic, playful, and is eating well. The child attends daycare, and an older sibling recently had similar symptom. The child has no significant medical history, is up-to-date on vaccinations, and has no history of hospitalizations or surgeries. The child takes a vitamin D supplement and has no known allergies. On examination, the child appears well, is playing and engaging with the examiner. The child can hop on one foot but cannot stand on one foot for more than two seconds, throws a ball overhead, draws a person with 2-3 parts, sings, and can state their full name. Based on this information, which is the best conclusion?","This is most consistent with an uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection in a well child who is developmentally normal for preschool age (about 3–4 years). The motor, language and drawing skills shown are appropriate overall, so reassure and provide symptomatic care; no urgent investigations or referral for developmental delay are indicated.",It is expected for this child to able to  tell stories at his age,True,False
545,"A 57-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents to the emergency department with acute onset of chest and back pain that began one hour ago. His vital sign show elevated blood pressure at 168/111 mmHg, pulse of 95/min, and normal temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Recent routine blood work from one month ago was normal. Current ECG is unremarkable. Laboratory results show: Hematology: - Hemoglobin: 15 g/dL - Hematocrit: 45% - Leukocyte count: 6,300/mm^3 with normal differential - Platelet count: 222,000/mm^3 Serum Chemistry: - Na+: 141 mEq/L - Cl-: 103 mEq/L - K+: 4.5 mEq/L - HCO3-: 24 mEq/L - BUN: 42 mg/dL - Glucose: 129 mg/dL - Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL - Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL What is the most appropriate next step in management?","Suspect acute aortic dissection. Immediate management is to reduce shear stress — start an IV beta‑blocker (eg, esmolol or IV labetalol) to lower heart rate (<60) and systolic BP (100–120 mmHg), give IV analgesia, and arrange urgent imaging. Because his creatinine is elevated, obtain transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) rather than CT angiography with iodinated contrast.",Transesophageal echocardiography,True,False
362,"A 19-year-old female collegiate volleyball player seeks medical evaluation. Her medical history includes seasonal allergies but is otherwise unremarkable. During her team practices, which occur 5 days weekly and last up to 3 hours, she consistently experiences episodes of chest tightness, shortness of breath, and ""coughing fits"" approximately 10-15 minutes after beginning exercise. Her physical examination reveals no abnormalities. While encouraging continued physical activity, what is the most appropriate therapeutic intervention for managing her symptom?","This history is classic for exercise-induced bronchospasm. The most appropriate therapy is a short-acting inhaled β2-agonist (eg, albuterol) used prophylactically about 10–15 minutes before exercise (eg, 1–2 puffs). If symptoms are frequent or not controlled, add daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy.",Prescribe a daily low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid and an as-needed inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist,False,False
252,"A 1-year-old male infant is brought to the emergency department by his foster mother, who reports that he has been behaving unusually since this morning. His medical history is unremarkable. On examination, the infant appears lethargic and has a distinct odor of alcohol and cigarettes. Multiple bruises are noted on his shoulders, head, and buttocks. The left lower limb shows restricted range of motion. Fundoscopic examination reveals bilateral retinal hemorrhages. His vital sign include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), pulse of 150/min, respirations of 50/min, and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Before the examination is completed, the foster mother expresses impatience and asks to leave. When informed of the suspected diagnosis, she becomes angry and refuses treatment for the child. What is the most appropriate immediate next step in management?","This is suspected nonaccidental trauma. You must immediately report to child protective services (and law enforcement) and proceed with emergency evaluation and treatment (eg, stabilize airway/breathing, IV access, urgent head CT, ophtho/neurosurgery as indicated) despite the foster mother's refusal. Guardians cannot withhold needed emergency care for a child.",Request an urgent CT scan and call neurosurgery,True,False
293,"A 68-year-old woman presents to the osteopathic clinic with a 6-month history of intermittent headaches and dizziness. She reports that dizziness often precedes the headaches, with both resolving spontaneously. She cannot identify a specific trigger for the dizziness, which she describes as a ""spinning room"" sensation that requires her to sit or brace herself. Episodes last between 30 seconds and 5 minutes, and she has not experienced any falls. She denies trauma or injury. Previous evaluations by her primary care provider, neurologist, and otolaryngologist have been unremarkable. Her medical history includes hypertension, for which she takes medication as prescribed. She denies tobacco or alcohol use. Vital sign are normal, and a neurologic exam is unremarkable. The Dix-Hallpike test is negative. Structural examination reveals the right greater wing of the sphenoid is superior to the left, with physiologic motion. The occipitoatlantal joint is boggy and tender, with a deep right occipital sulcus and symmetrical sulci in extension. At C6 and C7, the articular pillars are tender and rigid with restricted left translatory motion, unaffected by flexion or extension. What is the most likely primary diagnosis?","Most likely diagnosis: cervicogenic dizziness (cervicogenic vertigo) due to upper cervical/cranial-base somatic dysfunction (occipitoatlantal dysfunction with cranial base strain pattern, with contributory lower‑cervical somatic dysfunction).

Reason: episodic spinning vertigo with normal neuro/ENT workup and negative Dix–Hallpike points away from peripheral vestibular disease; the exam shows OA joint dysfunction (boggy, tender, deep right occipital sulcus) and a cranial base/sphenoid asymmetry and cervical articular pillar restrictions—findings consistent with a cervicogenic source of vertigo and headache.",Right torsion cranial strain somatic dysfunction,False,False
