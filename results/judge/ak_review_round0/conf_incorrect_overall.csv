773,"A 47-year-old male visits his primary care physician reporting a seven-month history of fatigue. His symptom include morning headaches, poor concentration at work, and excessive daytime drowsiness. He has experienced a 25-pound weight gain over the past year and recently began taking daily post-work walks for weight management. He has no remarkable medical history. His vital sign show: temperature 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate 84/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and blood pressure 138/82 mmHg. His BMI is 36, and physical examination reveals a neck circumference of 42 cm with normal thyroid. His skin is warm and slightly moist without edema. Heart and lung examinations are normal. His abdomen is non-tender, and he demonstrates full muscle strength in all extremities. What is the most appropriate next step in diagnostic testing?",Suspect obstructive sleep apnea. The most appropriate next diagnostic test is an overnight sleep study (polysomnography) to document apneas/hypopneas and determine the apnea–hypopnea index.,"Complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and thyroid-stimulating hormone",False,False
667,"An 18-year-old male with multiple stab wounds arrives at a rural emergency department. His medical history includes obesity, diabetes, recurrent upper respiratory infection, heart failure, and a 10 pack-year smoking history. Initially, he maintains his airway and demonstrates adequate oxygenation and ventilation. His initial vital sign show: temperature 97.6°F (36.4°C), blood pressure 74/34 mmHg, heart rate 180/min, respiratory rate 24/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.

Her medical history includes alcohol use disorder, depression, and aortic and mitral valve replacement. Current medication are bupropion, citalopram, and warfarin. On the fifth day of her stay, she develops a fever and becomes more difficult to arouse than usual. She denies symptom such as cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or dysuria. Blood test reveal leukocytosis. Urinalysis shows 0-3 white blood cells/hpf and is negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and blood. A chest radiograph shows no acute abnormalities. Blood cultures are drawn, and both bottles grow coagulase-negative *Staphylococcus*. Which test is required to confirm the most likely source of infection in this patient?","Remove the central venous catheter and send the catheter tip for culture (eg, semiquantitative roll-plate).

103,"A 24-year-old male arrives at the emergency department following a low-speed motor vehicle collision where his stationary vehicle was struck from behind by a car traveling at 11 miles per hour. He reports intense back pain but denies other symptom. His medical history reveals ongoing physical therapy for back pain that is most severe in the mornings, improves with physical activity, and worsens during periods of inactivity.

His vital sign show: temperature 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure 117/78 mmHg, pulse 116/min, respirations 12/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical examination reveals spinal tenderness and limited range of motion, with the remainder of the examination limited by pain. The patient is seeking documentation to be excused from his final examinations and work duties. What is the most probable diagnosis?","Ankylosing spondylitis — inflammatory axial spondyloarthritis.
