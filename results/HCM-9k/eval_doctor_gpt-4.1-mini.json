By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time?

      "model_response": "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.",

Can you please tell us what diagnosis he might have based on this?",
      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. OLD (interstitial lung disease) can not be caused by single exposure of any chemical. Chronic exposure (for years) of chemicals can cause OLD. It is not possible to find out cause for each and every OLD patient. Some patients can develop OLD just because of aging (old age). So your uncle is not having OLD due to breakage of acid bottle. He might be having age related OLD. Better to start Perfinodone and N acetyl cysteine (NAC) for OLD rather than searching for cause. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your uncle. Thanks.",

By your history and description, possibility of bacterial infection especially staphylococcus is more in her case. She is having pleural effusion and infective skin lesions on breast.

Better to send pleural fluid culture and sensitivity for the diagnosis of staphylococcal infection. This will also tell about effective antibiotic therapy. With appropriate antibiotics and Care, this infection can be treated. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your aunt. Thanks.",

I appreciate your concern towards H pylori infection which normally causes break in the lining of the stomach (peptic ulcer). H pylori is an exceptional bacterium which can survive in the acidic environment of the stomach producing tissue damage result in ulcer. Since this is a bacterial infection, hence antibiotics are used for 2 weeks to kill H pylori. Along with antibiotics Omeprazole is given for a period of 4-6 weeks to suppress the acid production and to increase the healing process of the ulcer. It is not a serious condition, usually triple treatment is sufficient to cure this condition. You must avoid taking Alcohol, hot and spicy foods, NSAID painkiller, smoking, caffeine, carbonated sweetened soft Chat Doctor. I hope all your doubts have been clarified in a simple language,Feedback in this regard is highly appreciated. Take care",

      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burning in chest. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.  4. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 5. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Lose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

Another thing i want to share that i was suffering from loose motions and was on Ofloxacin-200mg with ornidazole500mg B.D dosage (oflox OZ )medication for 2days and continued ofloxacin-200 B.D dosage (oflox) for another 3days as was suffering cold and cough also.now i need to go to gastro doctor to get the ultrasound reports checked. Just want to know what could be the reason for this elevated SGPT and will i get the clearance for joining new company.what should i do to lower my SGPT levels?? and what diet i should follow i am not a heavy drinker just take drinks occasionally and i am not fond of junk food as well.",
      "model_response": "Hello, I can understand your concern for abnormal blood report.1) Your symptom of loose motion might be due to indigestion. There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days. Hope I answered your query. If you have any further question, I would be happy to help you. Have a nice day!",

The doctor drilled out the pulp (noting that it was mostly dead) and put on a temporary filling until the root canal specialist could see me.  Now, about 36 hours later, Im in quite a bit of pain again, both on the tooth that was operated on and in a molar on the top of my jaw and in the back jaw muscle.

      "model_response": "Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Dead pulp inside a root canal is almost always infected with several bacteria. Now, while removing those dead pulp/ remaining tissue or washing the root canal, there is every possibility that some part of that infected material pushed through the root apex foramen(hole) to the surrounding area. Naturally that area become infected and in many instances the infection expressed as an acute infection of root apex area with pain and may be with swelling. It is called ENDODONTIC FLARE UP. It may happen in 50% patients after the cleaning of root canal. The dentist has no control over it. There is no need of postponing your travel schedule. You should start an antibiotic like Augmenting or same type (Amoxicillin 500 mg + Clavulanic acid 125 mg) 8 hourly for 5 days. Along with that you have to take Diclofenac 100 mg + Paracetamol 500 mg, 3 times a day in full stomach. If you have a history of excessive acidity, you have to take 10 ml of any liquid antacid before taking Diclofenac.  Your pain will subside with in 2 to 3 days. But continue Antibiotic for 5 days.

      "model_response": "Hello, I can understand your concern. Usually, wisdom teetChatDoctore in mouth at the age of 18 to 25 years. However, as you have never had them in mouth, it is possible that they might be impacted or locked in the jaw. As right side of jaw is causing you pain, let us focus on that only. Due to absence of physical space to come out in mouth or due to its improper position, it might be possible that the wisdom tooth of that side was locked in the jaw all this time and now might be impinging on the muscle of the mastication or nerve that supplies tongue causing you the pain and discomfort you are experiencing. It is also a possibility that a tooth might be decayed on the side of the jaw that is causing you problems, has developed an abscess that is causing these symptoms. In both cases, you need to visit a dentist to get an oral examination to find out if any tooth is decayed and taking x-ray of the wisdom tooth area to diagnose wisdom tooth related problem. By the time you ET an appointment of the dentist, Ibuprofen 400 mg thrice a day will help you in getting relief from pain. Please refrain from hot water gargles or heat compression as if the pain would be abscess related, it would worsen. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.

What could be causing these pimples and what condition might she have?",
      "model_response": "Hi, Is she having fever? How are the lesions-itchy / fluid filled / pus filled? It was helpful if you can send us a picture. In hot and humid climate, most likely this is Emilia- small pimples over the skin due to clogging and blockage of sweat glands. In absence of secondary infection (painful / edematous / pus filled), this does not require any specific treatment other than avoiding direct sunlight and keeping the skin cool with wet moping 3-4 times a day(apart from routine bath). If itchy, I used to give calamine lotion and antihistamine like levocetirizine for few days. In short, if she is not febrile and the lesions are not with surrounding edema / pain / tenderness / pus filled-this does not indicate bacterial infection-hence no need of antibiotics and no chance of blood contamination.

A x-ray should be taken according to the point of tenderness. If wide pain is there I recommend taking a pelvis and Lumbosacral spine x-ray. If no fracture is then it can be due to strain or sprain. In such case I advise muscle relaxants like thiocolchicoside NSAIDs like diclofenac and neurotrophic Chat Doctor. I also recommend doing warm compress on back. Hope this may help you.

Your current symptom may be related to residual depression. It is better to get re-evaluated by your psychiatrist to investigate and treat these symptoms effectively.

It is quite common for kids to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the kid takes feeds, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastronomic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

This will relieve the throat infection.- since the sinus congestion is most likely reason for associated headache, steam inhalation or use of humidifiers during sleep are useful remedies.- use antibiotics after throat swab culture for streptococcal infection if the symptoms are severe and fever spikes occur.

The itching comes and goes and shows in small patches , not lumps but itchy red spots. i am worried that it is an std as i have had a lot of unprotected sex recently (lesson learnt) but the symptoms don t relate to any std so i m puzzled!? i also have what i thought was joggers nipple? very itchy nipple and also my face sometimes has dry patches on the eyelids and near the hair receding line?

When there was fume (smoke) due to reaction of bleach +Harris, it entered in your lungs through inhalation, and you developed allergy. This fume was a predisposing factor, otherwise your lungs were already sensitive to allergy. Due to this allergy there develops, coughing, sneezing, tears from eyes, red eyes, nasal discharge, itching in eyes and over face. Due to these symptoms you got infection and this produces expectoration (phlegm or pus in your words). Please don't worry, be tension free, this sort of allergy is very common. Consult a physician and take treatment, once alright (cure), forget, again allergy take treatment. Antihistamine + bronchodilator helps in this type of condition. If infection than take antibiotics.

The acceptability of oral contraceptive preparations in various individuals differ from each other. Therapeutically both preparations are found to be equally effective. According to surveys conducted, the order of side effects reported by people using Tenor 35 is nausea, bloating, anxiety, breast pain and depression whereas for Movie 35 the order is depression, anxiety, bloating, dizziness and breast pain. Since both are hormonal preparations, these side effects are expected. The symptoms of depression you have, is suggestive of movie.

Fact or Fiction: Amoebic dysentery has been eradicated in North America. Amoeba and trophozoites cannot be seen by the naked eye. Amoeba generally float on top of the toilet water, easily visible. Standard O&P lab tests cannot detect amoebas and trophozoites. The infected stool must be submitted to a lab that has the special equipment and appropriately trained personnel in order to detect amoebic dysentery disease. Two or more antibiotics will be necessary to eliminate such parasites; long term if the host has been infected over a long period of time. Could you please tell me if these symptoms and facts indicate that I might have amoebic dysentery?",

What could be causing these symptoms and what is my diagnosis?",
      "model_response": "Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint pain in tooth after cavity filling and preparation of tooth for placing a crown clearly indicates that the nerves of the tooth have been opened up due to preparation of cavity to retain the filling causing inflammation and condition is known as Chronic Irreversible Pulpits . You should consult your dentist and get an X-Ray done, and it will definitely show exposed nerves and blood vessels present in central portion of tooth in a small chamber known as Pulp. The treatment is first to get the filling removed under local anesthetic followed by Root Canal Treatment and the advised antibiotic AMOS TR-K CLV 875-125MG TAB twice daily, along with it a painkiller is to be taken to relieve pain as antibiotics can reduce infection but to relieve pain painkiller is needed. You can take Ibuprofen for moderate pain but in case of severe pain Motorola or Tramadol can be taken. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards... Chat Doctor. .",

In the past few days, I have done nothing that might cause these. It s happened a few times in the past, but not often. A few days ago, I started having a sore throat and I was wondering if there could be any corrolation. I cannot remember if the last time this happened was during a time at which I had a sore throat. So far, no unexplained bruising has occured on my stomach, back, chest , etc and very rarely on my arms (though I assume that it s only unexplained because I don t remember hitting something). However, the bruises which have just appeared are not in any place I would bump into. I m a 21 year old otherwise healthy female. The only concering aspect of my medical history is that my mother, my half-sister, and my grandfather on my father s side have all died from cancer . Two cases of melanoma and one of colon cancer. Could the bruising be a result of my sore throat? Or should I be seeing a doctor?",

      "model_response": "Hello, Appendicitis is a high probability. The pain in appendicitis begins in the per umbilical region(that is around the naval) and then migrates to an area called as McBirney point that is at the junction of the medial 2/3rd and lateral 1/3rd of a line joining your naval with the anterior superior William spine. This area is roughly the same as you have mentioned. Further evaluation is needed. Blood counts, urine examination and ultrasound scan of the abdomen are required. In appendicitis the blood counts will be high, urine will be normal or show mild hematuria and USG abdomen will show an elongated or enlarged appendix. Treatment is mainly surgical, however in some rare mild cases, medical management with painkillers and antibiotics may be tried.",

Such changes occur with age and can cause mild lower back pain and spasm of muscles. A pinched nerve can also arise from this condition. You must consult a neurologist and probably also get a lumbar spine MRI scan done to know if there is a disc herniation or nerve impingement which is not seen clearly on SPENT CT should you experience severe pain in the region. It is important to know why you got a spent CT done and if it is related to any cancerous condition for which you are taking treatment. There is no serious concern for the above findings.",

This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to Chat Doctor.  Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there. Next time check if she is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put her in lying position after feeding till she burps out the swallowed air.2. If she is still crying - put her in prone position and keep patting her back gently so that she passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Regards -",

It can also be an ulcer. Normally This happens with fever and infection and regress on their own. I suggest you to check if it is discolored, enlarge or have uneven borders, then get it checked. Else you can wait for healing up of your infection. Take your prescribed medications. Take multivitamin tablet one per day. Maintain God oral hygiene. If warm water is tolerated, do warm saline rinses. Maintain good diet and HY Chat Doctor.  If it burns while eating, you can apply oral anesthetic gel 5 min before eating. Hope the answer helps you.

In this case most probably there is herniated disc disease, so I suggest you to consult a Neurologist and to discuss the possibility of imaging study of your lumbar spine. Since there has been trauma you'll need plain radiographs and MRI imaging. Treatment modalities should become clear after this. Hope this answers your question.

Among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% by the end of second year. So don't be worried. You will conceive. Since your doctor has already started treatment I presume that all baseline infertility investigations including semen analysis are normal. Then this is called as unexplained infertility. The cause cannot be found with available investigations. What your doctor has done is right step. Have GUI after induction of ovulation with Gonadotrophin. You can have 3-4 cycles of GUI. I hope and pray you conceive with the help of GUI. If you do not get pregnant with this treatment, the next option would be IVF (in vitro fertilization). I hope this is helpful. If you have further concerns, do contact me through Chat Doctor. To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. I hope this is helpful.

How is the potential for using these values of semen to make an egg pregnant : Volume 1.5 Sperm concentration (mill/mL) 38 Rapid linear progressive (A) 00,0 Slow/ Non-linear progressive (B) 09,0 Non-progressive 08,0 Non-motile 83,0? What do these results mean for my fertility?",
      "model_response": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor The analysis for your semen is as follows:Volume is 1.5 ml/ ejaculate-This is low volume as the normal volume per ejaculate should be at least 2 sperm count is 38 million/ml- This is normal sperm counts. The cut-off for normal sperm count is at least 20 million/ sperm motility is less than the normal range. Non-motile sperms are 83 %. Normally at least 50 % sperms should have rapid progressive forward motion. There is no comment on morphology and presence/ absence of pus cells, RBC's and other nucleated cells. On the basis of this report your sample is deficient in adequate volume and adequate volume. It can lead to infertility i.e. inability to fertilize an egg under physiological conditions. However, I recommend you to get semen analysis repeated after three days of abstinence. If, again the sperm count remains low, there are other techniques for fertilization of the ovum. You can get details of which from a fertility expert. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.",

No instant swelling that I noted (adrenalin) but did feel pain, I admit I kept playing so did weightbear after falls..first fall of significance in first half. Knee started to stiffen up and get more painful towards end of match, knee noticeably swelling and real discomfort on car home and painful to sleep, ache walking and stairs or kneeling painful...used price technique straight away..iced it straight away, tubrigrip compression and elevated..knee now feels better..widespread bruising tender on palpation of joint line/bruises, knee not as stiff but still an ache at end range flexion swelling has reduced. I think when the bruising goes the dull ache in my knee should go too, I feel I dont need physio or medical intervention as its only been 3 days since injury and to let healing process take its course? Am I foolish or should I check if ligaments/cartilage isnt Injured even though the symptoms/mechanism don t match? Thanks",
      "model_response": "Hello, I have studied your case. As per your history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs may be associated collateral ligament injury. If pain persists then you may need to do MRI knee to see for any functional defect. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. Rest and ice fomentation along with supportive brace will help to reduce swelling and pain. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take care.",

Could you please tell me what this rash might be?",
      "model_response": "Hello.thanks for sharing your query Since it is already 8 months since the insertion was done, I won't think that the Implant should be a cause of the rashes you have. You may apply a mild topical steroid for 3-4 days to see if it improves. If you have itching, oral anti histamines may be taken. However, if your lesions persist, you must visit a dermatologist.PUPPY rash is a pregnancy related condition and resolves mostly within a week of delivery. A few women continue to experience symptoms into the postpartum period, but I think this not be related to the present symptoms. Hope this is helpful. Take care.",

      "model_response": "Hi. Thanks for your query. Read your history and understood the problem. It is good that you had been diagnosed and well treated for Tuberculosis of abdomen. Since you were asymptomatic for last year the chances of an active TB of abdomen is remote. The probable causes for belatedness and tightness of your abdomen can be: Intestinal sub-acute intestinal obstruction due to stricture formation of intestine; this is quite common sequel. Can be a mild gastroenteritis. I would advise you the following. X-ray of the abdomen in standing position. This is the cheapest and simplest test to see for intestinal obstruction. Ultrasonography and CT scan of the abdomen to confirm. Routine tests of blood and urine. Enterocolitis if obstruction is suspected, Diagnostic Laparoscopy: this helps in diagnosis and well as therapeutically. One can cut the bands / release the adhesions. Take a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole for 5 days, is there is a response, nothing to worry. - Maintain healthy food habits, avoid too many fibrous foods as they can cause repeated sub-acute intestinal obstructions. If no relief further investigations and treatment will be required.",

It may benefit to consult your doctor and discuss, as these may be related to your earlier problems. In addition, you may need to do nerve conduction studies to look for peripheral neuropathy.

If the test is positive you should also do the TB testing by Inexpert, It is also diagnosed the common resistance pattern and can help you in treatment part. TB treatment have many side effects, please do not discontinue the treatment as it can create resistance pattern in the bacilli. Complete treatment only cures you but also prevents future relapse.

Delayed positive test could be due to exceptional additional delayed ovulation from the other ovary. In such confusion, I would advise you to take the help of ultrasonography. Ultrasonographic ovulation monitoring has an edge over the kit:1. It gives visual evidence of ovulation.2. It informs us about the size of the follicle when it ruptured to release egg. Follicles between 18 mm to 21 mm size give best results of pregnancy. 3. It informs about the endometrial thickness also. For successful implantation, at least 10 mm thick endometrium is lucrative. I hope this helps you.",

In your case two factors are playing role one is your disease & other is your inactivity with your age. In my opinion if you are facing severe problem with low back pain then you may ask from your doctor about intermittent course of low dose steroid. This is very helpful in such cases. Your doctor is the sole person to decide its pros and cons in your age. You should continue or start calcium & vitamin D therapy. Hope I have answered your query.

From your history, and ultrasound report of fluid in the cul-de-sac, I would suspect you to be having a PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) which might also be associated with a UTI (urinary tract infection), which had to be ruled out by a culture and sensitivity test. If I were your doctor, I after a general physical examination of yours would advise you to get yourself assessed by a gynecologist of your area to rule this out specially if you are sexually active. Till then, I would advise you for a course of broad spectrum antibiotics along with an anti inflammatory and a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

      "model_response": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The sensitivity in the tooth can be because of the cervical abrasion(Wearing away of tooth structure) since it is in an abnormal position, more force will be applied when you brush. The other possible cause can be a dental caries in between the teeth. So consult an oral physician and get it evaluated and take a radiograph to confirm the diagnosis. If the tooth is a wisdom tooth, then get it removed. If it is some other tooth, you can get it restored a cement material. I hope my answer will help you, take care.",

I have called him and he said the will fit when I grow into them. I don t think I m going to be doing anymore of that. What to do? He pulled what 10 teeth I had left now nothing and owe him over 5,000$. What could be causing these problems with my dentures?",
      "model_response": "Hi, Thank you for the query.  First thing is you cannot wear a denture which is bigger than the size of our palate. Definitely you will have a gag reflex as the over extension of the denture is into the soft palate area leading to gag reflexes. Coming to the growth part, you are already 38yrs old, at this age there won't be any growth in your body parts. Only thing what can be done is asked your dentist to prepare another set of dentures which are of your size not huge and size of the teeth should be reduced, and your occlusion should be checked thoroughly and extensions of the dentures are important so that you won't end up in gag reflexes anymore. Best thing is to see a prosthodontist. Hope this information will help you. Take care.",

      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Mild Breathlessness, skipped heart beat, left sided chest pain etc. can be seen in arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). So first get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. In my opinion, your pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal cause. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Sit with proper back and chest support. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

Since you are diabetic, this kind of purulent infection can be seen with mixed infection like aerobic, anaerobic bacteria with tuberculosis. So abscess fluid (pus) culture and sensitivity report is needed. Culture will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. For this we need abscess material, and it is available only after aspiration. It is not much painful procedure. Intensity of pain will be similar to simple needle prick. If you're really afraid of pain then ask your use local anesthetic agent (lidocaine) before the procedure. Don't worry, this won't cause pain. Hope I have solved your query.

      "model_response": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. We talk about hypertension if we have mean values that exceeds 140/90 mmHg. Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension, usually in young ages, meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem, a cardiovascular pathology. As you explain, you have done all the examinations, and they result normal. According to this, we are dealing with essential hypertension. It is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure, but it should be treated life long. If you tell that you still have high blood pressure values despite your treatment, it means that you have to rise your medication to better control your blood pressure. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend a holder pressure monitoring for 24 h, to know your mean values. After that if they result high I will add another medicament or rise the dosage of your existing ones. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards.",

This is explained by the effect of sub mucosal fibroid which can cause increased bleeding, so blood loss results in decrease RBC counts and Hemoglobin.3. You need to get it removed if it is a large fibroid and sub mucosal in location.4. Transfusion requirements depend on how much your Hemoglobin is. If it's less than 7, you will require transfusion, if not it can be corrected by parenteral iron therapy. Hope this helpsRegards",

It is possible that after a viral infection, cough persists for a few weeks. If fever has subsided, please do not worry about cough.2. For symptom relief of cough, I would suggest him a cough syrup containing antihistamine like pheniramine.3. Warm saline gargles would also help him to recover early. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to your son. If you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish your son the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards.",

In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x ray2. PUT (pulmonary function test). You are having chronic cough for 5 months. So we need to rule out lung infection and bronchitis first. So chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection.PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. Uncontrolled sleep apnea can also cause chronic cough. So better to consult pulmonologist and first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment.

Your symptom might also accompany a runny or stuffy nose, a feeling of liquid running down the back of your throat, frequent throat clearing and sore throat, hoarseness,wheezing and shortness of breath. You might be having allergic rhinitis or Gastroesophageal reflux disease. Try taking tablet containing montelukast + levocetirizine, cough suppressant syrup before bed at night and pantoprazole 40 mg empty stomach in the morning. If your cough doe snot subside by this you should see a doctor and get a chest X-ray done to get a confirmed diagnosis. In the meantime stop smoking, avoid allergens and reduce acid reflux. This includes eating smaller, more frequent meals; waiting three to four hours after a meal before lying down; and elevating the head of the bed at night. Hope this helps you. Take care.",

Usually, rather than fever, what is more, important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.  If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.  Once the viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.  I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.",

However, my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck. Can I still have a normal delivery? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position, before my delivery date which is 14th Feb.?",
      "model_response": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. So if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. However, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. Ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. Going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. However, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. In the US, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. It works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. Regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. So the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. If you are considering having a version, I suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,",

I want to do exercises but there is literally no energy in me due to these prolonged pain. I feel low and down through out the day at work and at home too. Can you please tell me what might be causing these symptoms?",

      "model_response": "HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It is unlikely that this injury would have significantly affected your ability to conceive. There are different reasons for infertility. It can be due to male or female causes or due to a combination. In terms of your partner, you are right in assuming that he would need a semen analysis. The cost would vary according to one lab to the next. He can either consider speaking to his urologist, speaking to a lab directly to find out the cost. In terms of your investigations, your doctor would need to assess the different aspect of the reproductive system-the uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervixThis would involve both imaging and blood tests. You should consider visiting your gynecologist or a fertility specialist. Even if issues are found with either of you there are effective techniques available that may be able to help you conceive.

      "model_response": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it is possible that if the margins of the crown is not intact and there is a gap between crown and tooth, water and food debris along with bacteria can seep into the tooth and leads to secondary Infection. In this case if the decay has not reached the nerves present in the center of tooth then you may not have pain, but the tooth can continue to decay. If this is the case you will have to get the crown removal, get the tooth filled or Root Canal treatment has to be done followed by replacing the crown. You can take a second opinion if you wish as well as you can send me a scan of the x Ray of the crowned tooth so that I can guide you how you should proceed for treatments. In case if tooth is decayed then the treatment advised to you is appropriate. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.",

      "model_response": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint sudden swelling in fingers and ankles along with itching or Urticaria in different body parts seems to be most probably be due to allergic reaction to some unknown allergen. It can be due to a number of things certain insect/bug bites, poison ivy, skin cosmetics, detergents, foods, leather, latex, medicines etc. It can also be due to mite infestation causing Scabies. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and blood tests can help in confirming the diagnosis and treatment can be planned accordingly. You can be advised to take anti allergic like Allegra or Clarity, apply steroid ointment, do cool compresses over the body and apply calamine lotion. In case of Scabies you can be advised to apply Preterit lotion and take Ivermectin. You can also be advised anti allergic along to relieve itching. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

When you are a diagnosed case of an ovarian cyst, this becomes the most probable reason in spite of the fact that you have pain on the right side of the abdomen and the ovarian cyst is on the left ovary.

So possibility of pneumonia is more. And pneumonia is infection, so it is definitely curable. You need broad spectrum antibiotics, antihistamines and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.

Very weird. Can you please tell me what might be causing this bleeding?",
      "model_response": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint bleeding from airhole can be due to infection in the area of ear-piercing while at times tightly packed earrings can lead to lack of air flow to the area of ear-piercing and can lead to inflammation and slight area of necrosis. I would suggest you to avoid wearing the earrings for a few days and clean the area with antiseptic solution and apply an antibiotic ointment over it. Cool compresses can also be relieving. You should wear earrings a bit loosely fastened so that air can flow easily. You should also wear gold or plastic earrings as they are inert materials and will not cause allergic reaction. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.",

This can be arrhythmia like PSV or atrial fibrillation, where your heart rate suddenly goes up and BP falls. These are episodic tachycardia and your ECG may be normal if you are not having tachycardia during ECG. You will need evaluation like thyroid test and holder monitoring. You should also get one hemoglobin levels done. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation. Also, to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Is there any stress or anxiety associated. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day. If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiologist studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases.

      "model_response": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your question... Since you say that he had been depressed even before the accident, it is more likely that his current psychiatric symptoms are related to the depression. When depression becomes severe, psychotic symptoms can appear (like hearing voices, false beliefs, etc.) Moreover, since he was well enough to be sent home after the accident, it is unlikely that he would have suffered from any significant brain damage.  Depression can be caused due to neurochemical imbalances in the brain and need not be stress related always. So, it is not surprising that he did not reveal anything to his parents. With appropriate medication and close follow up he should be able to come out of his depression. Best wishes,-",

I would come up with these possibilities for this severe pain in the left hip joint, This includes. 1 Pinched nerve (sciatica) , diagnosis can be confirmed by C T scan and X-ray of lumbar sacrum region. As you mentioned that there is severe pain radiating to leg, foot, as all these symptoms are an indication of sciatica nerve involvement (pinched)2 Degeneration of head of femur. Diagnosis can be confirmed by C T scan & X-ray of head of femur.3 Osteoporosis, diagnosis can be confirmed by blood examination and bone density test.4 Osteoarthritis, diagnosis can be confirmed by C B C and E SR. Hysterectomy have not any role in this pain. In my opinion consult an orthopedic surgeon and get his opinion. Good luck.",

Due to which you are facing difficulty in getting pain while performing knee movement.  Kindly do hot water fermentation and allow the limb to rest. Use knee brace for 3 weeks or so. Then do simple knee exercises like static Qua Chat Doctor.  You should be fine. As you applied to ice there won't be swelling. So in any injury icing is advised to avoid swelling as it will lead to vasoconstriction of blood capillaries. So you don't have swelling.  Usually, icing is advised if we are planning for some x-ray or MRI. Do the conservative therapy mentioned above, and you should be fine. Hope I have answered your query.

      "model_response": "Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion iron supplements are known to cause constipation or hard stools. Constipation is routinely seen complaint in pregnancy. To prevent the constipation:-1) Change the iron preparation- Certain iron preparations tend to cause gastritis, constipation etc. So changing the brand might be tried.2)Take adequate fluids up to 3 liters per day.3)Take high fiber diet daily.4)Take laxatives if needed. Nothing to worry. It will subside by following the above measures. Coming to vaginal lips swelling check for any infection like white discharge or itching or any high BP. The swelling can also be related to excessive straining at stools. If everything is normal the swelling might be considered physiological as some swelling of vaginal lips might be there in pregnancy and subsides after delivery. But iron preparations might not be associated with swelling of vaginal lips. Anyways nothing to worry as such. Prevention of constipation is important to avoid other problems. Hope this helps.

They said they are not sure what happen  and I think maybe I got bitten or something cause there was a mark there and know like I said still a mark but red around it and I was running a temp also of 100. What do you think is causing this infection?",
      "model_response": "Hi. Thanks for the query. As per your symptoms of having a red and swollen area above the upper lip and having raised body temperature can be either due to allergic reaction to any bee sting or can be due to infection like Hair follicle infection. As you are being treated with Cephalexin that is an antibiotic, and you have taken 3 doses without any side effects you can continue taking the antibiotic for the prescribed time period by your physician. You can also take Acetaminophen or Tylenol for reducing body temperature. Topical application of steroid ointment can help in reducing inflammation and discomfort. Hope this helps. Regards.",

Bacteria or viruses can appear in blood after a throat infection, urine infection or lung infection. Once the bacteria enter the blood they can infect other organs including the heart. The bacteria settle on the valves of the heart and cause infection and destruction of the valves. This happens over time and cannot happen in 24 hrs. But he must have had symptoms like fever, breathlessness, shivering etc. You have not mentioned any of the symptoms. Here. The treatment of infective endocarditis is long term treatment with antibiotics and some residual damage to valve always remains. Wishing him good health Regards",

So possibility of throat infection or cancer in neck (vocal cords, pharynx, larynx etc.) is more. So better to quit smoking as soon as possible. Consult ENT doctor and get done 1. Clinical examination of neck 2. CT scan of neck 3. Endoscopic examination of pharynx and larynx. You may need to biopsy if there is any mass lesion. You may need antibiotic, anti histamine and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright but first quit smoking. Hope I have solved your query.

The measurements give an estimate of weeks but, a variability from the actually calculated date can be present, as ultrasound only gives a rough estimate. So in effect the ultrasound findings can be plus or minus 1 week in first trimester; 2 weeks in second trimester; and more than two weeks in third. This variability is decreased with newer machines but can't be totally removed. So I would say that this report is absolutely reassuring, and you should not worry at all. A good fetal heart rate and a placenta which is only grade 1 maturity indicates that everything is as it should be at this stage. Do not worry. Hope this helps. Regards.",

As per your complaint it seems that due to traumatic injury caused by nail there has been torn of mucosa leading to formation of a painful traumatic ulcer. Due to inflammation there is pain. I would suggest you to start applying a numbing gel containing Lidocaine or Choline Salicylate to relieve pain. You can apply steroid ointment containing Escort or Triamcinolone Acetone to reduce inflammation. You can take anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen. You can also take vitamin B complex daily. Suck ice popsicles or do cool water rinses. Avoid hard and spicy food to prevent further irritation and injury. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.",

      "input": "Hi, 3 weeks ago I fell in my wrist & was told I d probably fractured my scaphoid bone. It was put in a Velcro cast for 10 days & told to come back to fracture clinic for it re xraying & they would decide the course if treatment from there. When I attended clinic I was told I wouldn t need an X-ray as they were certain from my original X-ray that I hadn t broken anything, to take my cast off & get it moving again. I mentioned I had a numbness and pins & needles in my thumb but that was put down to the cast I d had on. One week later, I still have a numbness/pins & needles in my thumb & my wrist continues to ache/throb. What could be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "Dear patient, a needles and pins sensation is generally due to a nerve compression/irritation. If it wasn't due to the cast (that's a possibility), probably your trauma provoked a hematoma pressing on a nerve (median nerve? Collateral nerve of the thumb? It depends on numbness distribution). I propose to wait a month from the trauma. If this sensation persist, get an electromyography/electroneurography to objective the nerve injury. If positive, do an RMN of wrist and hand to understand the cause (i.e. hematoma) and project its possible removal. Concerning instead your doubt about a scaphoid fracture, I don't know which X-ray projections you did (scaphoid fractures are hard to be seen in standard X-rays). However, if your wrist remained very painful for 10-15 days after the trauma, a scaphoid X-ray projection or, better, a wrist CT, would solve your doubts",

      "model_response": "Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.",

The itching is still persistent and leads to bump formation, on itching think it is due to bug bite may be right, it could be due to bug bite. Bump formation after itching is normal, as this due to histamine release. Have you taken any treatment for itching, I presume no. Take antihistamine and short course of antibiotic (since we presume this is bug bite of few weeks' duration).Hopefully you symptoms will subside in a week time. Consultation with a physician is encouraged. There are negligible chances that it could be an STD(sexually transmitted disease). Hope this answers your question.",

      "model_response": "Hello and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your Implant was removed. Implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. So if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. Many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. So, I suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your Implant removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,",

Your baby seems to suffering from gastroenteritis give her ORS, zinc. You also need to show her to your pediatrician early as she is weak and prone to severe infection without warning signs like fever. You need to give her a balanced diet with variety, and supplements after consulting your doctor, Cowlicks alone is not going to help , I usually do not recommend it. There is also a need to find cause of her poor weight, was she born with low birth weight, what diet is she taking, is her appetite poor or weight not increasing despite good appetite ? All questioned needs to answered and her diet to be planned accordingly in consultation with your doctor. Hope this answers your question.

This is a\" diabetic foot\" :Presentation of diabetic foot is of three type :1 Neuropathic foot in which neuropathy dominates .2 The neuroischemic foot, in which occlusive vascular disease is the main factor .3 Non-neuroishemic but purely infected foot. Since you are a diabetic patient, so any of above possibility may be the reason of NON-HEALING DIABETIC FOOT. In my opinion you must consult a PLANETOLOGIST and get his opinion.

      "model_response": "Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Although more details would help, from your current symptoms, I would first think of allergy.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you montelukast and levocetirizine regularly during your \"bad\" season. You can also start montelukast 1 week before onset of \"bad\" season which may reduce your symptoms.3. If still you have cough, I would suggest you to get your chest examined by a doctor who will listen to it with a stethoscope and may identify the cause of cough.4. I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them.5. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health. Thank you & Regards.",

Bites can become infected when bacteria are introduced from under the nails during itching. It is not likely that they are linked to the cold that you are currently fighting. The use of topical antibiotics may help but if they do not resolve with topical treatment then oral antibiotics would be needed. You should also consider repellent to prevent further bites.

A Catholics gland cyst, a Garden cyst, soft tissue swelling, etc. Inflammation of Catholics gland is quite painful. However, the Catholics cyst lies at the junction of anterior two thirds and posterior one third of the labia minor. You need to consult a gynecologist for clinical assessment. Depending on the type of lesion, further management will be planned. Surgical removal of the cyst will be curative in most of the cases. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.",

In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal cause for your chest discomfort. Your chest discomfort is associated with exertion (playing tennis), so musculoskeletal cause is more likely. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal discomfort. 1. Avoid awkward movements. 2. Sit with proper back and chest support. 3. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. 4. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 5. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

We took him to the E.R. and he was diagnosed with Diverticulitis after a CT scan with contrast. Due to not having insurance at the time, we never followed up until this past month. He had a colonoscopy done and they found nothing to even suggest he has diverticulitis. They also eliminated Crohn s and Celiac disease. The only thing we have noticed that aggravates the pain is steak so he avoids it but still has the pain. He describes it as a bruised feeling. It s a dull pain unless he eats something that aggravates it or if the area is touched then it is a sharp pain, and he says it s not a cramping pain at all, just a very bad bruised feeling. It also causes him weird bowel movements that range from diarrhea one day to close to constipation the next. His doctor is treating him for Irritable Bowel but the medicine hasn t helped at all. What could be causing these symptoms?",

If the medicines are not helping, the probable causes and the treatment area as follows:-Notice more than the steaks, which food stuffs and beverages cause / increase his problems. -Increase the dose of the medicines o give more effect or may be change over to another medicines. -Stress and anxiety are the biggest contributory factors, and he has to keep them under control at any cost, with yoga, meditation and / or medicines.",

Regarding your concern, I would explain that your resting heart rate values are a little high, but they can be related to Adderall IR adverse effects (it is known to increase the heart rate by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system). As your blood pressure values are normal, the situation does not seem to be really concerning. But, I would recommend performing some other tests to be sure that everything is OK: - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart rate values for a prolonged time-complete blood count for anemia-thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance. If all these tests result normal, there is nothing to worry about. If your heart rate is persistently high, I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of reducing the dose of Adderall. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing good health,",

As per your complaint a dark purple lump next to molar tooth can be due to a dilated vein also known as Varicose vein or a Varix. The lump might be due to formation of a small blood clot that got lodged in that area forming a Thrombus. It is not AA serious condition and will not cause any serious problem. It can gradually reduce in size on its own. If it is not ruled out as the cause other causes can be like mucous cyst or Muscle, Hematoma or a Hematoma. Confirmation can be done by getting a clinical evaluation done by an Oral Physician or an Oral Surgeon. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.",

The pain disrupts sleep and is painful while sitting still. I am a 53yr old female, 175lbs.  Last year  blood work shows my white blood cell count to be slightly elevated but I have seen a oncologist who didnt find anything.  I also have been very tired and have been getting frequent headaches.  I was recently diagnosed with a autoimmune disease Vitilago.  I have seen a dermatalgist and endocrinologist.  No one has any answer.  What could be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Hip and upper thigh pain which is of burning nature and is occurring more in sitting position especially in obese individuals (as in your case) is suggestive of NEURALGIA PARENTHETICAL. This condition results due to the compression of Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (pinched nerve) at the level of groin fold. A few conservative measures which are effective in treating this condition includes - wearing loose clothing (avoiding tightness at the level of the waist and groin fold), Losing weight, taking OTC pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) ibuprofen (Advil) or aspirin, Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the legs and buttocks etc. Other causes arising from the Hip joint are also to be excluded by having X-rays and MRI scans, which may also present with similar picture. So, I suggest you to consult an orthopedic surgeon for a detailed clinical examination and further management. Hope this information is helpful. Good day",

I would advise you the following:Get the blood, urine and stool test done. Standing X-ray of the abdomen and Ultrasonography. Get a course of additional medicines if advised so.

She is getting a CT tomorrow as the ultrasound showed a nodule on the right and a mass on the left.  The surgeon said whatever it is it needs to come out.  What are they suspecting?She does not smoke or drink, has a history of atrial fib and was on amiodarone until her doctor discontinued it 2 months ago due to high liver studies.  she is now on only beta blockers.  Her thyroid studies at her last physical 6 months ago were normal.",

Her CT report clearly mentioned left sided mass and right sided nodule. So possibility of papillary thyroid cancer is more. Old age is an independent risk factor. It is usually painless and present only as enlarged mass in the neck. So better to get done fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for the confirmation of papillary thyroid cancer. Consult oncologist and plan future treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.",

The treatment for this is physiotherapy to release the nerve compression so may visit the nearby physiotherapist. Till the time you can have tabbed Neuronion forte once a day which is a nerve vitamin and Diclofenac/Ibuprofen. Also, you should get nerve stabilizer prescribed like Tab Pregabalin will stabilize the nerve and reduce pain. Etc. You need to visit orthopedic for all these investigations.

So, as your old physician suggested you need not have to worry about it. You need to have some lifestyle modifications to reduce the level of ALT. Daily physical exercise, eat healthy balanced diet preferably fresh fruits and vegetables which contain several anti-oxidants that help in reducing the ALT, AVOID ALCOHOL if any, avoid fatty vegan and non-vegan meals, fast junk foods, take plenty of oral fluids.

As your daughter was bitten by a vaccinated dog over the lip which has led to bleeding from the site, according to WHO it is categorized into Cat III. Even it is a vaccinated dog you need to doubly check whether it is properly and completely vaccinated, because the bite is on the lip which is closer to the brain and the virus can ascend easily and reach the brain and can affect it. So I would suggest you to take 1. Active immunization with antirabies vaccine on days 0,3,7,14 and 28.2. Passive immunization with Rigs around the wound.3. Oral antibiotic like Tab Augmenting, twice daily4. Topical Tract ointment.Don't take any risk with this disease, I would suggest your daughter to take aforementioned treatment. Thank you.",

      "model_response": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after sexual penetration. It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.",

The CT head/brain without contrast reads...Moderate white matter hypodensities are seen in the deep, periventricular and subcortical white matter with volume loss and old lacunar type infarcts in the basal ganglia. There is mild global volume loss. Chronic microangiopathic changes in the old lacunar type infarcts and mild global volume loss. What does this mean for her diagnosis?",
      "model_response": "Hello, In relation to the fall that she took the CT scan doesn't show any damage due to the hit, none of those findings are related to the trauma, they were already present before she fell and hit her head. The findings are due to chronic changes in the brain matter and its blood vessels. Chronic microangiopathic changes are changes to the small blood vessels. To a point, they are genetically determined and are found in many people as they age. They are accelerated by factors affecting blood vessels such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etcetera. So the only thing that can be done to slow down this process is checking for the presence of those factors and ad Chat Doctor. As for the mild volume loss that means the mild shrinking of the brain. Again that is part of aging, all of us start to lose brain cells after our thirties, so as we age volume loss accumulates. So that finding depends a little on her age which you do not mention, the older she is, the more such volume loss is expected. The report speaks of mild volume loss so no reason for major concern on that regard, the blood vessel changes which I add",

The number of platelet count in dengue is of prognostic value;it means that it tells us how the disease is progressing and if platelet count has come down to 43K from 1.6K in one day, it should be followed up keenly although in my opinion a retest is a must. If it goes down further, he may need platelet infusion. Please talk to the doctor and keep an eye over the platelet count and the overall condition of your brother. I hope this answers your question.

Your blood pressure and heart rate are normal, but since you are having history of atrial fibrillation and ablation, better to first rule out coronary artery disease as a cause for your left arm and Chest pain. So first get done 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) and coronary angiography (if required). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Apply warm water pad on affected areas.

In your case especially, the association with increased ESR, fatigue and petechial suggest exclusion of a bone marrow malignancy, especially a leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy might be compelling. Secondly, I would to suggest carrying out Anti-nuclear antibodies, HLA27 and autism antibodies for your symptoms are also very compatible with systemic lupus erythematous, which is an autoimmune disease. The symptoms as I said are very suggestive of a leukemia. An appropriate diagnosis is critical, for the setting up of an appropriate treatment plan. Delayed diagnoses my make the prognosis more faint. I suggest you book an appointment with the hematologist, to rule out a leukemia or any possible blood malignancy, and possibly systemic lupus erythematous. Thanks for your question and hope this helps, Luchuo, MD.",

Most likely a virus, but it is safer to go to his pediatrician in routine hours within a day if possible.

Psoriasis classically involves the extensors like scalp, elbows, knee, shins and lower back, but sites like maxilla, groin folds can also be involved either together with the extensors or solely, where it is classically known as inverse psoriasis would advise that you see a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. Psoriasis in the body folds responds very well to topical steroids as well as topical immunomodulators like tacrolimus/pimecrolimus ointment. An OTC antihistamine once daily e.g. cetirizine would help you symptomatically with the itch. Regards",

In Oct 2010 we got to know that i am having a cyst which was constantly present for 8-9 mionths and our gyn said that it might be a chocolate cyst and endo. So we had laproscopy done in Sep 2011 and after that tried for iui for 5 months but unsuccessful. Then our gyn said to go for IVF wherein we still are thinking as it is very expensive. We went to another doctor in March 2012 and she prescribed Lupron depot inj for 3 mths and I got my mensus in Aug 2012..I want to know what are the chances to conceive with endo and should i wait for sometime and try iui or what else can be done..please help..Regards Neha",
      "model_response": "Hi, As you have already tried 5 cycles of GUI after laparoscopy, it's better to try for treatment which gives better pregnancy rate which is IVF. As you have already received In Lu pron Depot for 3 months, it would have been better to go for IVF immediately after 3rd dose of Lu pron as it increases chances of pregnancy in IVF. But still It's not too late. You can go for IVF straightforwards or can again take Lu pron depot for 1-2 months & then go for IVF. IVF is definitely the best treatment for you. Wish you good health.",

As per the description, all your symptoms suggest a degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine witChatDoctorpression of the neural elements. The conservative management of degenerative disc disease is as follows -* avoid lifting heavy weights as it imparts more strain on your back* avoid forward bending activities as it will worsen the disc protrusion* Use a lumbosacral back support to augment your spinal muscles* Intermittent pelvic traction to cause a regression of disc* Maintain optimum body weight, if you are obese* Physiotherapy to strengthen your back muscles. Physiotherapy has to be done only after the acute pain has subsided.* Judicious use of analgesics and muscle relaxants. If all these measures fail to provide you relief, then surgical decompression may be an option. Hope this information is helpful. Good day",

If flap is interrupting in its path then go for flap removal i.e. operculumectomy. Otherwise, if sufficient space is not available then go for extraction since it is vestigial & has no role in mastication. For temporarily relief do warm saline rinses 3-4 times a day. Start with Tab Amclaid-625 twice a day along with Tab Aerosol -SP thrice a day for 5 days. In Case of gastric problem take rabeprazole-40 mg once daily. Your herbal pills won't be of much use.

Thank-you Swaroopa.",
      "model_response": "Hi... Recurrent fever with swollen glands in the neck for the past 15 days could be ABV infection or otherwise called infectious mononucleosis. It is a self limiting prolonged viral illness. Rarely it can cause complications. I will suggest you how a viral illness behaves so that you will be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Regards -",

If blushing, sweating, along with possibly tremors or stuttering occur when you are in a social situation; you may seek the help of a psychiatrist. The other features of social phobia which you may be having are:1) Fear that people will evaluate you/ judge you negatively when you are in a social situation. Such fears are more likely in public speaking, talking to a crowd, or meeting many people at a party or social gathering.2) Many people have symptoms described in 1) above. But they should be severe enough to cause limitations in your functioning. Or you find the anxiety so severe that you avoid situations completely. This then leads to further social problems.3) You think this fear is excessive, but seem to have no control over it. There are medications as well as Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) for dealing with social anxiety. The disorder is sometimes almost a part of your personality, that it stays throughout life. However, medications or psychotherapy will help you deal effectively with the symptoms. Do seek a psychiatrists' opinion on it.",

However, if it was aneurysm, you should be feeling symptoms like pulsations, numbness over the area etc. What you are experiencing is a sharp and dull pain episodes in the cheek area which seems like pain from infection of the oral cavity or due to sinusitis. It could also be pain related to Trigeminal or Facial nerve. I would advise you to visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity to look for presence of infection in the area. If dentist clears you for any loci of infection, an ENT specialist or physician can examine you for sinus or nerve related problems. By the time you see a doctor, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Motorola 10 mg up to thrice day to have relief from pain. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.

I am not sure if it is anything related to hemochromatosis as you can walk at nights and not in day. Are you able to move your limbs during daytime? If you are able to move any of the limbs, then you will require psychological support and counseling.3. Routine hologram along with serum iron investigations will give a guide on hemochromatosis. Liver biopsy can confirm it. If more details are available regarding investigations and clinical history, I can be more helpful. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.",

Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

      "model_response": "Hallow, I fully empathize your sufferings. Mirena is an intrauterine device. When with IRENA in you start getting severe pain in abdomen, the cause could be:1. The uterus cannot get adjusted with it and is trying to throw it out. This is more commonly observed in women without any previous pregnancy.2. There is infection in the uterus and the device.3. The device is trying to perforate through the uterus. You will have to report to the Gynecologist at the earliest. Ultrasonography/X-ray can reveal about the perforation aspect. Rest two will have to be evaluated by the Gynecologist by clinical examination. You may have to get the device out if it is not tolerated by you. If there is infection, you may require a course of antibiotics. I hope I have guided you with sufficient information.",

Irregular intake of birth control pill & unprotected sex close to your fertile period or ovulation day (occurs 14 days prior to due date) are quite risky for being pregnant. In this case, I suggest you to undergo one home pregnancy test if you miss your next period. Above clinical features are quite relevant with possible pregnancy. Common symptoms of pregnancy:a) Missed period, nausea, vomiting, tender and swollen breast.b) Increased frequency of urination, fatigue, food craving.c) Slight vaginal spotting, cramping, mood swing, constipation etc. Hope, I have answered your query.

The side effect of Ventolin is increased heart rate but let me assure you that this is a very widely used medicine and well tolerated and so you need not worry about the side effects. Give your child steam inhalation twice or thrice a day and I think that she would get some relief. Also add some antiallergic syrup like Relent which will also help in diluting the cough.

It could be an allergy which increases with weather changes, dust, exposure to sun, certain plants, animals etc. Also, certain foods like nuts, seafood, processed foods, etc. You will need to keep a track of when exactly the rashes come up and if there is a common cause each time. Allergies generally reduce as the child grows, but repeated exposure to the cause can make it recur often. Use a mild sunscreen when outside. When rashes appear, apply a demonize cream on the face for 5- 7 days till rash subsides, no longer. Use an antihistamine like HY Chat Doctor. To confirm you can consult a dermatologist and run tests to check allergy levels in blood, also skin tests for possible causes. Hope this helps.",

      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You had choking and aspiration of food particles in trachea. Your symptoms are associated with eating. So by mistake when we aspirate food particles in trachea (wind pipe), it gets blocked. Due to this, we can not get air and hence we feel breathlessness. During this episode our body is deprived of oxygen and so black out is seen. To overcome this, violent coughing (reflex) is done by the body to cough put food particle. Once food particles are out, wind pipe is open, and you can breathe normally. So better to chew properly while swallowing. Do not speak much while eating. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

For that investigation needed wit:- Chest x-ray digital - Sputum examination- Auscultation - CBC-ADA estimation needed If specific cause found than treated accordingly. For bacterial infection antibiotic needs to be prescribed If on examination yellow sclera found than serum bilirubin estimation done and management for jaundice needed. With keeping my answer in mind consult physician for examination. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

Studies have shown that it effects the baby if taken after 4 months of pregnancy, causing the babies teeth to be discolored and can cause hardening and cause excess calcification of teeth and bones which is irreversible. But, since you are exposed to tetracycline at such an early gestation it is very unlikely to have affected your baby. Only minor abnormalities are known to occur in few women. Do not be overly concern and get a NT scan at 11 weeks and an anomaly scan done at 20 weeks to check for anomaly. Hope this helps. Regards.",

The removal of the wisdom tooth is a lumbar some process, with the breaking of the alveolar margin of the jaw bones, which may damage the nerves and vessels of the jaw.

      "model_response": "Hello, You may have a condition known as OSCILLOPSIA which refers to fields of vision that are in motion with head movements.  The underlying pathological mechanism involves a loss of image stabilization by loss of reflex control of eye muscle control when a person has their gaze fixated.  Things such as toxicity, infection (most importantly meningitis) or side effects from antibiotics can cause the condition.  Desalinating disease such as MS can also cause this condition, as well as abnormal movements of the eyes referred to as nystagmus. I recommend you seek an opinion from a NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGIST.  Vertigo from inner ear problems will not produce this phenomenon. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.",

      "model_response": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor ! On your description - not painful, hanging (which I assume you mean not firmly attached but mobile) and the recent onset - I can tell that there is no likelihood of serious infection or dental cyst/tumor. It could be a granuloma or a papilloma. All conditions are self regressing and you don't have to worry. Try not to disturb it though, and if you develop signs of infection (reddening, fluid discharge, multiple sores in mouth etc.) get it attended immediately. If papilloma or granuloma increases in size and interferes with normal oral functions, it can be surgically removed under local anesthesia. Hope this helps! Thanks.",

This lump is towards the left center side of your stomach/abdomen. As I don't have any direct photo of the lump / or not many details from you, I would advise you to consult ER surgeon who would rule out other causes as Femoral hernia, Inguinal hernia/Spiegelman hernia.

      "model_response": "Hello. Thank you for writing to topical treatment with ointments and lotions is usually combined with systemic treatment/ oral treatment for psoriasis involving > 20% body surface area. Phototherapy, though is a good choice for extensive body involvement with plaque psoriasis, however, certain body sites like scalp are resistant even to phototherapy. Apart from phototherapy Oral methotrexate is a well known treatment for plaque psoriasis and can be considered in a healthy young adult. Biologics like golimumab, ustekinumab are not first line options in a young patient with limited involvement with plaque psoriasis. Scalp involvement responds well to topical steroids lotions with or without salicylic acid. Vitamin D analogues e.g. calcitriol/ calcitriol lotions are also effective in scalp psoriasis. I suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region. Your dermatologist will assess the severity of involvement and advice accordingly. Regards",

If you did not have any further intercourse after your wife had her natural period, there is no need to worry about pregnancy. This delay in menstrual cycle could be due to a transient hormone imbalance often caused by sudden weight changes, stress, infections etc. Please ask her to see her health care provider to detect the cause and plan further management. If the sonogram of the pelvis shows normal study, hormones can be given to induce the period. Hope this helps.",

      "model_response": "Hi and pleased to answer you. Throughout pregnancy, the fetus bathes in a translucent pouch that gradually fills with amniotic fluid until the 35th week of amenorrhea where the amount of fluid is at its maximum with about 980 ml. Then the amniotic fluid decreases to the end to reach a volume between 600 and 800 ml approximately. The flow of the amniotic fluid signals the rupture of the membrane, and the risk of premature delivery if the term of the pregnancy is not reached. When the amount of amniotic fluid is abnormally low compared to the term of pregnancy, it is called oligoamnios. During oligoamnios, infection rate is higher. The premature rupture of the membranes (rupture before the beginning of the work) concerns 5 to 10% of the pregnancies. Its risk factors are the same as those of spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes. This patient received a punch on her abdomen, which caused a premature rupture of the membranes and then a loss of the entirety amniotic fluid then an oligoamnios was created, and during the 2 weeks before the hospitalization, there was infection of the genital and baby components and infection dissemination by haematogenous route Causing endocarditis.

I always have normal periods . ALWAYS. I have a calendar that I go by . It said that my next expected period was Feb 18 . On Feb 17th I started spotting . I only seen it when I wipe . I never had this happen to me before . When my period comes on it flows and its never light . This went on for the remainder of the day then the next day it got darker , but it filled up half of pantie liner . After that I used tampons to see if he will be regular and it wasnt . It was just little spots of blood . Im nervous to take a test . Could I be pregnant ?",
      "model_response": "Hello, In the current scenario, please do get the pregnancy test done as you definitely need it and hope for the best. If you cannot read the urine test properly, you should go for the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles along with a trans-vaginal sonogram to clarify the issue. The spotting could possibly be due to an implantation bleed, but, it needs to be clarified. If pregnancy is excluded, you could be having slight hormonal imbalance which is common now and then whenever there is some stress, infection, weight disturbance etc. Such a disturbance usually gets corrected spontaneously.

      "model_response": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Early pregnancy may naturally have periods of episodic vaginal bleeding with clots. This is caused as the baby with the sac in early pregnancy is too small to fill up whole of the uterus. The exposed inner lining of uterus may degenerate and bleed just like a normal menstrual cycle. I am assuming that your ultrasonography after the gush of bleeding showed a live baby with evidence of fetal heart beat. In that case chance of abortion is minimal. ASA or aspirin tablets are given in pregnancy to help in free flow of blood between mother and fetus. Please write back if you have any more queries.",

      "model_response": "Greetings HOPE you are aware of endometriosis. It means the inside layer of uterus called as endometrium is present outside the uterus, and it responds to the cyclical changes as inside uterus causing bleeding. As you have menses, there will be bleeding from this endometrium which can be present anywhere in the abdomen.the commonest site is ovary and all around outer side of uterus. So premenstrual there will be pain which depends up on the organ involved and the extent. So you can consult a gynecologist and get an ultrasound scan to rule out any cysts in ovary which is causing problems for you. Coming to your reports everything looks normal if done on day 2 or 3 of your cycle. Hope my answer helps you regards",

He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body? Sorry about this being such a long messge but we are at a wits end as to finding out what is causing this problem.  Could you possibly help us by offering your guidance about the fluid? What do you think might be causing this fluid buildup?",

If there is no active peritoneal dialysis going on, then the abdominal fluid collection is unlikely to be related to the Peritoneal dialysis catheter. Ascites or fluid in the peritoneal cavity can be due to a weak heart or liver problems. I would recommend a 2D Echocardiogram, Ultrasound of the abdomen and a diagnostic ascetic fluid tap.

My father has been suffering from high blood pressure and two weeks ago his pulse was at 125 for a number of days.  This landed him in the hospital for about 10 days. He was diagnosed with atrial fibralation as well as anxiety and chronic fatigue.  Both he and the rest of my family have been taking care of my mother who is has a terminally ill with cancer.  He is on a number of medications now and is taking Lisinipril and cumodin and other meds.  His cumodin level was high this week.  He walked to the store the other day and had to ask for a ride back as he wasnt feeling well.  The hospice nurse took his blood pressure and pulse today: 153/100, pulse 50.  She said that he should get checked out again soon as something does not appear right with his meds.  Could you please help us understand what might be going on with his condition?  My father is 79 years old.  Thank you.  Melinda",
      "model_response": "Hello, There are two issues in him, first his blood pressure is not under control so his BP medicine needs to be hiked up. Dose of lisinopril can be increased in multiple of 5 up to 40 mg. Blood pressure is not emergency you can get it optimized from your doctor.  Secondly, his pulse rate is low and pulse rate controlling med needs to be decreased. Like he must take some beta blockers like metoprolol or nebivolol, or other medicines like Verapamil or Diltiazem, dose of either med needs to be decreased.  Also, he should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week then once or twice a week. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and 5 days a week. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. There shouldn't abdominal fat deposition or obesity. Get your lipid profile and sugars tested once. Monitor INR regularly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

      "model_response": "Hi. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint at times after wisdom teeth extraction the muscles of mastication becomes tensed, swollen and sore leading to restricted mouth opening and pain. You should do warm compresses over the check and continue till the sides of neck. You should massage the muscles with your fingers starting from the front of ear progressing down the jaw reaching the chin. Try to open the mouth with fingers by pushing front teeth apart. You should also keep doing the jaw exercises advised by your dentist. You need to take Muscle relaxant like Flexion MR for relieving the spasms of muscles. Take soft diet and more. Of liquids but do not stay hungry. If still it doesn't improve consult an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. .",

      "model_response": "Hello and I hope I can help you today. Insulin is used to treat diabetes during pregnancy at all stages and is safe and effective. The disease of diabetes and high blood sugar is the part that is dangerous for the baby, and good glucose control is the best way to ensure a healthy child. Good blood glucose levels should be less that 95 for fasting levels and less than 120 after meals (2 hours).  If this is the way your wife checks her sugar, and you test at least 4 times daily, she is under very good control and should not need further adjustment of her insulin if her levels stay at the current level.  She should be checking her sugar fasting and then 2 hours after every meal.  So in summary, insulin is safe and absolutely necessary for the health of the baby if your wife has diabetes.  Please discuss the dosing regimen with your treating physician on a regular basis and make sure your wife checks her readings at least when she wakes up in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal.  She should also write down what she eats, so her doctor can also know if any changes need to be made in the diet. I hope this information was helpful and answered your question adequately.

Just continue with the antibiotics or analgesics whatever are prescribed by your dentist.  Septicemia or endocarditis are risk factors if you have undergone any previous surgeries or have any congenital heart problems or valve replacements. In that case the doctor prescribes you with antibiotics before the procedure itself.  Take sufficient rest and relax to have a fast recovery.

It is a condition where gum line with respect to the tooth shows severe recession and exposure of the root surfaces of the teeth.  It is caused due poor oral hygiene, improper brushing and flossing that leads to accumulation of bacterial plaque and calculus deep in the gum pockets and root surfaces of the teeth.  Yes CLINDAMYCIN is an antibiotic which can be used to prevent infection and suppress further damage, but antibiotic will work better when you get the gum treated by dental procedures. It needs to be treated by thorough professional deep scaling of gums and root planing of the teeth to remove all the irritants, this will help in resolving the symptoms followed by a course of antibiotic and analgesics.

      "model_response": "Hello, There could be a few reasons to your symptoms. Since your blood pressure was so low, the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. From you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. Language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere, so speaking would also be difficult. You didn't mention your age, but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain, what needs to be done is an MR-Angiogram (blood vessel imaging with MRI) or CT-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a CT) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. If neither of those tests are possible, then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. Alternatively, but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. They are very rare, but still a possibility. The symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. Lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. There is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. Again, I feel that that is less likely. None-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. Also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. It can be due to a Chat Doctor.  You should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Kristoffer Mission",

I no longer am experiencing shortness of breath, but I still have weasing in my bronchial tree. I am not a smoker.

      "model_response": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. Age more than 50 is an individual risk factor for bronchitis. You are also having wheezing with shortness of breath, these also favors possibility of bronchitis more. Bilateral septal thickening is also seen in bronchitis due to inflammation. So consult pulmonologist and get done PFT. PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but also tell you about severity of the disease. And for treatment severity is important. You may require inhaled bronchodilators. No need to worry much for septal thickening in both lungs.",

Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach twice daily.4. Go for walking after meals.5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent gas reflux.6.

The picture of your brother has several characteristics of vasovagal syncope, but the information you reported is insufficient to confirm the diagnosis. This type of syncope is often triggered by stress such as fear of needles, fear of heights, long periods of standing and in the same position, hot and stuffy places. Usually there is complete loss of consciousness, which can last a few seconds and the patient wakes up slowly, often with nausea and dizziness, and skin pallor and general ma-being. After a few minutes the person is totally normal. This all occurs by stimulation of the autonomic nervous system that causes bradycardia (reduction in frequency of heartbeat and Chat Doctor. To confirm this diagnosis and away from others is necessary look for a good Cardiologist to make a detailed medical history and discard cardiac and neurological causes.

For this reason, I would recommend performing further tests: - PCR, sedimentation rate for inflammation- blood electrolytes including calcium to exclude possible imbalance. Meanwhile, I recommend taking ibuprofen. I would also advise you to closely monitor the skin in this region for possible eruptions. Shingles can cause similar symptoms before eruptions.  Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards,",

Rapid progressive motility is below normal, but moderate is ok3.morphology of sperms seems to be normal. Another findings are prolonged liquefaction. I suggest your husband to consult an Chat Doctor.  If so treatment can be taken SND motility and liquefaction might improve. Need not worry about single report. There will be variations always. A repeat analysis after 2 months can be done. Hope my answer helps you. Regards",

Cause and plan of Treatment-In my opinion on the given data, you seem to have Epigastric Ventral Hernia with entrapment obstruction which is causing shifting pain from the adhesions of the chronic lump there. I would advise consulting ER Surgeon, who would treat it by Surgical Repair after study by USG scan.Don't guess more. I would advise ER Surgeon Consultation to avoid further complications with it. Hope this would resolve your issues. Act fast. So keep cool and Consult your ER Surgeon, if need be, who would treat it accordingly. So don't build up wrong concepts and create more psychic complications in you which would increase risks and costs to you, but just ask a query to Chat Doctor and be comfortable to resolve your health issues. Welcome for any more query in this regard to Chat Doctor. Write good reviews and Click thanks if you feel satisfied with my advice. Have a Good Day. Chat Doctor. N.",

There is a genetic predisposition to plasma, with at least one-third of patients reporting other family members to be affected. In most people plasma is a chronic disorder.  Sun exposure, pregnancy, hormonal changes, photo-toxic reaction to Scented or deodorant soaps, toiletries and cosmetics or medications are the commonest triggering factors of Plasma.

Can you please tell me how much possibility is there for a fetal heartbeat and fetaql pole after 10 days. Thanks in advance.",
      "model_response": "Hallow Dear, Usually by 6 weeks or so the fetal pole and fetal cardiac activity is detectable by ultrasound. If by 7 weeks, it is undetectable, there are following possibilities:1. The ovulation and conception might have occurred late in the menstrual cycle, which otherwise happens 14 days before the next menstrual period.2. There could be mistake in calculating the duration of pregnancy.3. The pregnancy could be without embryo (baby). This is known as blighted ovum. In such case, the ultrasonography image shows corrugated margins of the sac. If the margins of the sac are well-rounded, in order to exclude the first two causes, it is a good option to repeat the scan after a week to 10 days. If still the sac is empty, then the diagnosis of blighted ovum is confirmed. However, if the edges are corrugated, it is blighted ovum. Pregnancies with blighted ovum do not grow. If such pregnancy does not abort spontaneously, termination is the requirement. I hope this helps you.",

It should diffuse within a few hours or so. Then the lump should go away. It is not an infection. Regarding sharp pain in the eye, it appears unrelated. But if you find persisting symptoms in relation to eye then please revisit your dentist.Also, please mention in which jaw the crown was placed upper or lower?so that I can suggest better in this regard. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care.",

      "model_response": "Dear, We understand your concerns went through your details. Let me assure you, masturbation is not unhealthy. Masturbation is normal and natural. Frequency of 4 or 5 times a week masturbation is pretty normal and not in excess. Therefore, masturbation is not the reason for your present problem. I think you are obsessing with your sexual ability and sexual organ. Unless you are actually in sexual intercourse, you cannot judge your hardness. Secondly, when you try to test your hardness, the hardness comes down, because at that moment, you are diverting from sexual thoughts. The reason for your present problem is simply psycho-logic and never organic. I suggest you to consult a psychologist for sexual counseling.

This is very common especially in cases you mention, but elderly age is a reason also. It is generally self limiting but very uncomfortable meanwhile. There is oral acyclovir he might use to speed up healing, it should be started as soon as possible and there are Chat Doctor.  Local cold compresses can help with pain also. As for you, you are not in risk if you are not in contact with the fluids that come from the vesicles. Very little chance it will spread to you by contact, it generally comes from the inside of the patient (the sleeping virus) but to be safe please try to avoid contact with the area that has the vesicles.

Both these diseases are common in smokers and cause similar symptoms like cough, expectoration, fever and breathlessness. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. Chest x-ray 3. PUT (pulmonary function test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You will mostly improve with antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilator, inhaled corticosteroids and other supportive Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

Fatty liver is one of the more common causes of liver disease presently, it may reverse if lifestyle changes are made or progress to inflammation of the liver. The lifestyle changes would be increased activity and dietary changes such as reduced carboy Chat Doctor. Variation of the recto refers to separation of some muscles in the abdomen (the rectus abdominis). An umbilical hernia is a protrusion through a defect in the umbilicus. The anteverted uterus is not concerning and would not cause any issues. A uterus can be bulky for different reasons such as fibroid, pregnancy, endometriosis, adenomyosis, molar pregnancy, cancer. It is possible that the hernia is the cause of your pain particularly since the pain is around the navel. I hope this helps",

With in 4 days the lump was the size of a hockey puck and extremely painful. They did surgery to remove it, but didn t take it out 2x s. Once before a mri and petscan, and once after, but both times they just sewed him back up and said if they removed it, they would be doing more damage than the tumor. He says he has a non-cell malignancy. He told me today it is stage 4 melanoma. He is in his 4th week of daily radiation, but he said that he has been told he is inoperable, uncurable, but manageable. He originally told me that the tumor was solo, and not attached to anything when he had an ultrasound, but 4 days later when they did the 2nd surgery it has wrapped itself around things in his neck. What kind of cancer does this? Is he terminal?He lives in another state and I think he is keeping information from me to spare my feelings?",
      "model_response": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. This is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. What happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. When there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. Since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. The lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. Doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. It is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. Please do not worry.",

In my opinion you have a kind of sciatica due to nerve compression, actually these two symptoms are not related, but bowel movements may exaggerate the pain sensation.  For my patients I may recommend physiotherapy, hot massages, spinal straightening exercises will be helpful, painkillers like Advil tabs when needed, gentle massaging with anti-inflammatory gels, B12 vitamin supplements, muscle relaxants will be effective for most of the cases, in more severe and chronic cases steroid tabs or injections are prescribed.  If pain persists I recommend MRI scan on your spine to exclude any spinal disc herniation and follow them up with your neurologist for proper evaluation and management.

      "model_response": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You must know that Adderall is a stimulant of central nervous system. It affects chemicals in the brain that contributes to hyper reactivity. Through stimulation of nervous system in a secondary way it stimulates the electrical system of the heart. This stimulation might cause fast heart beats over 100 or generate other electrical impulses in parts of the heart different from normal sinus Rhythm. This causes premature heart contraction that we call extra systolic beats. In this situation you feel your heart like running, making pauses or skipping beats. You might feel anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply, palpitations or pulsations to your veins all over. Every kind of stimulation of nervous system might cause this rhythm issue to simple emotional stress, coffee consumption or pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism, this kind of medicine that act directly to the system. So, nothing serious is happening to your heart. it's a reaction to this stimulation. My opinions is to discuss this effects with your doctor and decide together what to do with and fit is possible or allowed to stop it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards.",

Could this be the cause of my tinnitus and hearing loss?",

Due to cavity there can be referred pain in ear, but this tinnitus and hearing loss can be due to ear problem for this you should consult ENT surgeon and go for its treatment. For cavity in wisdom tooth you should consult dentist and go for IOWA X-ray of tooth if possible go for restoration of tooth or extraction of wisdom tooth.  In meantime do like warm saline rinses, you can take analgesic for pain like Painted or Paracetamol by consulting with your local doctor. Hope this will help you. Wishing you good health.",

When I run my fingers along my spine, I do notice a slight protrusion at the source of the pain -- I m not sure if it can be seen, but I can feel it. I don t have any serious history of either back or muscle issues. I do feel quite restless when sitting down -- I am constantly shifting.

      "model_response": "Hello Bad childhood experience, troubled relationships between parents are causing the disturbances in your behavior and relationships. Your close uncle tried to approach you and this resulted in fear of males. But presently you had relationship with a boy, so you have to move on. Childhood trauma results in conflict in mind, and it causes severe distress, and it can cause serious effects on personal and social life. I would advise you to please consult a good Psychiatrist for expert opinion and get your Psychotherapy done. Psychotherapy will resolve the unresolved conflict and will improve your condition. Life skill training is also needed. Try to do relaxation exercises and this will increase your confidence. Hope it solves your query. Thanks",

The limited or difficulty in mouth opening can be because of the trauma to the muscles while injecting local anesthesia or repeated injections, or it can be a disc displacement in the jaw joint that occurs if you had kept your mouth opened for long time during cleaning.

I went to urgent care, they didnt do an xray, and diognosed me with bronchitis. They gave me an anitibiotic, but im concerned because, I just dont feel like myself, and I think its something more.

And you are not improving because you are not taking appropriate treatment for bronchitis. Bronchitis needs inhaled treatment. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will improve with inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

They removed my cecum, ileocecal valve , and appendix, luckily I do not have a colostomy they were able to reconnect everything without any problems. I did have a general surgeon who actually specializes in vascular surgery do the procedure because he was on call. I have been experiencing some difficulty sleeping since surgery. I will doze off and wake up feeling nauseated and lightheaded with a weird vibratory sensation throughout my chest. Also when I stand up my vision goes dark for a few seconds. I am eating 4-5 small meals a day and drinking one Gatorade and about 2 bottled water a day. My urine is light yellow and I am going about 5-6 times a day. BM s daily to every other day, no diarrhea. I haven t been taking any pain meds since I left the hospital on the 12 th. I take Zantac and Prevacid once daily. It may just be anxiety from the whole experience but I m just a little concerned. Can you help me understand what might be causing these symptoms?",

It is always expected to feel some nonspecific gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea or stomach cramps but symptoms you're saying don't seem to be serious. If you have fever associated with abdominal pain OE extensive vomiting then you should go to hospital.  For other, I suggest just to wait few more weeks. It is not so much time from surgical procedure so just be wait a bit more to see are these symptoms gonna persist. Wish you good health.",

      "model_response": "Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor Ischemic colitis is caused due to obstruction to blood flow of the colon. Cholesterol deposition in the arteries of the body lead to narrowing of the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. Some subjects have increased tendency to atherosclerosis which depends on genetics and environmental factors. This causes narrowing of the arteries leading to stagnation of blood at these sites and subsequent formation of clots. This causes you the attacks of ischemic colitis. In you case since you have suffered from two heart attacks, I suppose you have got high propensity to atherosclerosis, may be due to genetic factors and strong family history. Treatment is blood thinners like aspirin which I suppose you are already on. Usually two blood thinners are used on recurrent attacks of ischemic colitis and even in case of previous heart attacks. So ideally you must be on two blood thinners. If despite this you have episodes of ischemic colitis you must be on higher blood thinners like warfarin. However, higher blood thinners have a potential of causing bleeding elsewhere in the body. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good healthRegards.",

There is trivial turbulence in the aortic valves. There is trivial pulmonic and trivial tricuspid insufficiency. The TRP is not raised. Both IAS and IVS look intact. There is no thrombus or vegetation. There is o.75cm pericardial effusion behind RV and at the apex of the heart. What diagnosis can be made from these findings?",

This report broadly means that you might be having hypertension which is causing pressure on heart & causing thickening of a chamber of heart (LVH). It is also telling that one side of heart is working less than other parts(hypokinetic inferior wall), which may be because of blockage of one of the arteries of heart. Rest everything is fine.

      "input": "Hi, I am 24 year old male working for a software company in Bangalore. I am working for the past one year. I had a severe back pain and also severe pain in the neck which made me to see an orthopedician. I was given some painkillers and some exercise tips to continue. I followed it for some time and could not find much improvement after stopping the painkillers. I went back to the doctor again for a better advice. He suspected something peculiar now and referred me to a pain and rehabilitation clinic. I got the diagnosis there. Do you know what it is a Computer related Injury (CRI)? This is the exact diagnosis made. After I came out of his office and walked through the road thinking what peculiar diseases are coined depending on the occupation we say and googled it next day, I was astonished to hundreds of pages opened up with this condition called Computer related Injuries.The CRI research was on for the more than 25years though the IT revolution has come up in late nineties in India.",

It may be dislocated, or it may be just degenerative changes to your cervical vertebral column. These changes explain the back pain, headaches, dizziness.  Also, the changes in your cervical x-ray can be explained by this diagnosis. I would recommend you have a cervical CT scan to visualize the discs and find out where the problem is. In the meantime you can use acetaminophen, ibuprofen or fetoprotein for the pain and avoid abrupt cervical movements. A cervical collar can help. Hope to have been helpful.

I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms may be related to anxiety or autonomic dysfunction related to nightmares. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing a careful physical examination and some tests:-resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound-chest X-ray study-blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, etc.) to exclude other causes of increased heart rate. An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would be necessary to examine your heart rhythm trends during day and night and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. You should discuss on the above issues with your attending physician. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best regards!",

I am having a sensation of constant/always urination; with a weired kind of burning senation in peline urethera and penile head. This situtation occurs after i did abusive/lengthy masturbation 10 MONTHS ago. After masterbation or having intercource with my wife it used to come for only 2 - 3 hours and after sleep in the morning used to feel alright. But due to a lenghty/abusing masterbation session 10 MONTHS ago feeling of urination have become constant and not going away The following test are done so far. 1. Urine Culture - All Normal. 2. Renal Ultrasound - All Normal (prostate size is normal about 24) 3. CBC - All Nomral. (Dr Says very slight Iron Deficiency Anemia; dr put me on iron tablets for a month) 4. LFT - All Normal. 5. Diabetic - Normal 5. Vitamin D - I am deficient (Dr put me on tablets for a month) 6. Vitamin B - Before the onset of these symptoms i was deficient in vtamin B and had few injections of cynacoblamin were given. All the doctors are clue less as of now; these symptoms are really really killing me everyday. I have seen a few urologists with the following diagnosis and treatment but with no relief. 1. A urologist diagnosed it as non-specific non-inflammatory prostatitis and put me on Cipro for 4 weeks but to no avail after that he put me on levofloxacin for a week with no relief at all. 2. Another urologist marked it as NSU and put me on numbing jell and a tablet which turns your urine dark yellow for 5 days with no avail. I also took a TCA Tofranil (Imipramine) for about 2 weeks for no avail at all. After being exhaused from thease treatments i have also tried alternative treatments as follows. 1. Homeopathic for 2 months with no avail. 2. TCM (Traditional chinese medicines for few months with no avail) As I am running out of ideas may be the following can be considered. 1. parasitic infection. 2. Pudendal nerve entrpement or perinal nerve pinching etc. Dorsal nerve etc. Or any other nerve disorder. 3. IC 4. MS Please help me to get rid of these annoying symptoms. Could you please help me understand what might be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "HelloThanks for query. Based on the facts that you have narrated you have a long-standing history of pain in urethra and constant sensation to pass urine which followed after prolonged abusive masturbation which has not responded to treatment with multiple antibiotics and none of the various relevant test are conclusive as regards the diagnosis and cause of your symptoms. In view of all these symptoms started after prolonged abusive masturbation I think the prolonged masturbation has caused trivial damage to urethra resulting to form a scarring and flimsy stricture of urethra. I would suggest you to consult your urologist again and explore need for doing endoscopic examination of urethral passage (Ureteroscopy).

The dr says it is not caught from my partner but every time I have sex with him I am back to the Drs again complaining of the same symptoms. Sometimes the urine samples show nothing but most of the time it does. Why is it that I no sooner get rid of the infection then have sex and the infection starts all over again. I m beginning to wonder if my partner is the cause of all of this. Never ever had this issue before with any other partner. I m in my 40 s and have been with my partner for 2 years and am completely monogamous (never have numerous partners). I m so over this, can you help me understand what might be causing these recurring infections?",
      "model_response": "Hello, Klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (HAI). They could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. In diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. Due to their particular structure, Klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin, etcetera.). Often their treatment is possible only through the use of Carbapenems and Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, etcetera.). Klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. Recent studies have reported that recurrent Klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent Klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. Recurrent strains of Klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. Now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. The fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. In your case the following measures could be of benefit: 1. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six months, by using low doses of the antibiotic that is more effective in your case. You have to consult with your doctor about which antibiotic you will use and for how long.2. Post-coital therapy, by applying a single dose of the most effective antibiotic each time after having sex. You again have to consult with your doctor about the dose and type of antibiotic. 3. Apply the so-called post-coital voiding that is: urinating immediately after sex.4. You should maintain high genital hygiene as it could help as well. It is also important that you have a thorough evaluation by radiological examinations in order to rule out abnormalities of the urinary tract (anatomical or functional) that could boost infection recurrence. Lastly, Klebsiella is not transmitted sexually, thus clearly your partner has nothing to do with your recurrent infections. But, during each intercourse, it is easier for the bacteria to get contact with your urinary tract (remember that Klebsiella is a normal part of intestinal tract and colon). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

      "model_response": "Hello dear, Thank you for sharing your concerns in this website. I understand you are worried, but I would suggest you to calm down and follow these step sim explaining below:It's obvious you have done a muscular straining and probably spinal ligaments straining since you have done an acrobatic movement that has passed your limits. So first I would suggest you to use:- Fetoprotein gel to your affected area of your back to kill the pain and inflammation- Oral painkillers such as ibuprofen of diclofenac if you have severe pain.- Cold compresses first and Warm compresses if more than one day have passed from the injury. Try to reduce the movements of your back and lumbar area for a while of time. If you perform these steps and still you have not any improvement then consult an orthopedist to do further examinations. I hope you will get relief soon. Take care and I wish all the best! Chat Doctor.",

Any fever or infection at this stage cannot be taken lightly and needs to be evaluated. You need to measure your temperature 4 hourly. Also do you have any complains loss of fluid, or breaking of membranes? It is a possibility that you have ruptured your membranes and are going into labor. But if you have chills and decreased fetal movement, any womb infection called chorioamnionitis needs to be ruled out.Also, you need to get an ultrasound and fetal heart tracing done to check for fetal well-being.

In my opinion, we should first rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) because arrhythmia commonly causes palpitations and Fluttering sensations in chest. So consult doctor and get done 1. ECG 2. 2d echo 3. Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Pulled muscle can also be the cause. So apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.

      "model_response": "Hello, I have studied your case. As per your age and history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. If pain persist then you may need to do MRI again to see for any functional defect. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair, and same day you can go home. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health.

      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely because your pain is associated with specific position and movement. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of chest. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. Take simple painkiller like paracetamol or ibuprofen.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I would like to reassure you that these findings are not significant and do not represent any serious brain disease.

Hyperintense loci on MRI are most often due to migraine and ischemia (lack of blood flow to brain). Ischemia of brain occurs in people with high BP and sugars. At this stage, you need to keep your blood pressure and sugar under good control. In addition, aspirin tablets may be taken to prevent further ischemia. I hope my answer helps.

His eyes are blood shot and he looks miserable. no pain to light or sound however, when i tell him to touch his chin to his chest he says there is pain. It also hurts his neck at the base when i touch it. He also says that he just feelis icky. He is congested and has a cough that only seems to come on at night. This may be an over worried father but my 18 yo daughter went thru a bout of meningitis that was caught early by me and I just wann be sure. this could just be a common cold right? the pain when bending the neck is what worries me but it isnt terrible pain he says its like a pinch then it goes away. Could you please tell me what might be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "Hello dear! I can understand your concern. The pain which you are describing can't be meningitis as in this infection the child is quite sick and is unable to flex his neck. Its probably sinusitis or could be viral flu both of which can have headache. I would advise giving him some good anti histamines like levocetrizine 5 ml at night or fexofenidine 6 mg /loratadine 10 mg once in the morning before going to school. You can also try some home remedies like 1 tablespoon of honey in a glass of Luke warm water once daily. Normal saline(2 ml) nebulization and especially steam inhalation also helps. Dnt worry he will be fine in 2-3 days with all this. Get him an X-ray PNS done, and his eyesight checked because sometimes it could be due to refractive error. Hope it will help.

If you receive any serious stress on back colonial sinus will recur. You can take the detail solution in the water diluted. Which can help clear infection only. Remember it will not clear up the sinus. You can use the pillow before you seat. As it can help you to get severe sinus infection. Also wear the cotton undergarments.

Nausious all the time especially after eating, over weight and can t loose weight even though I eat almost nothing. I do eat healthy, veggies and fruit don t seam to trigger it any different than any other food. I have seen a few Drs and am to see a colon specialist on the 4th. My nodes started swelling last night making it unbearable to sleep. worse ones are in abdomine. Last time I went to the hospital they did basiclly nothing, the meds they gave me made me sick. There has to be a reason for this. No one seams to be able to or want to help. What could be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor! I am Infectious Disease Specialist! I went through your query! There are various causes of lymphadenopathy (Viral, bacterial, tubercular infection), lymphoma, leukemia, etc. You need thorough examination and set of investigations(ZN stain from FNAC and cytology) to come to diagnosis whether viral, bacterial or tubercular in nature. In your case as you have evening rise it is likely \"Tubercular\" in nature pulmonary or extra-pulmonary. But I recommend take a course of antibiotic for 2 weeks to see if it resolves before you get investigated for other causes. You will need antibiotic prescription. Happy to take more queries! You can also write a review for me. If you would like some more information, I will be happy to provide. Take care!",

Correct ways to use computers and mobiles as maintaining wrong postures worsens the condition. If pain is affecting mostly while going to bed consider sleeping on hard bed or consider changing your mattress to half inch memory form mattress. Hope you find the answer useful.

Your symptoms are improving with Cardio workout. Heart and lung diseases actually precipitate after Cardio workout. So possibility of major heart and lung diseases is very less. Stress and anxiety can cause similar symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

You may also see a breakthrough bleeding due to excessive hormone levels. Other side effects like rashes, nausea, breast tenderness or abdominal pain, apart from vascular disturbances, may also be seen with high doses. I do not think you should be using some other form of pill once you are on Diane 35. You are amply protected if you are regular with your medication. Hope this helps.",

      "model_response": "Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Yes irregular cycles cause infertility.  So I suggest you following investigations to know the cause of irregular cycles and take treatment accordingly.-- thyroid profile, serum prolactin, ultrasound abdomen to rule out polycystic ovary disease (PCs). The pain in breast during cycles is seen in some people. Don't worry about that. You can take primrose tablet after consulting your doctor and painkiller. Normally breast develop in proportionate to body. If you still feel your breasts are small compared to your body then for external appearance you can wear thick padded bra. For your sexual life, then you can go for breast enlargement surgery by a plastic surgeon. Hope I have been helpful. Regards Chat Doctor.",

      "model_response": "Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1. First do not panic 2. As you have regular cycles, please get ovulation study on USG from day 10 of the cycle to know about the day of ovulation. 3. Post menstrual HSG - hysterosalpingography, within first ten days of the cycle will be helpful to know about the patency of fallopian tubes. 4. Please get husbands semen analysis done with abstinence of 3 to 5 days.  This helps to know about quality and quantity of sperms. 5. You can simply opt for unprotected sex act on and around the day of ovulation. 6, Lastly, about your concern of seminal fluid coming out of vagina. Normally, the motile sperms start travelling inside the womb and the seminal fluid remains in the vagina. This fluid leaks out of vagina after some time.  So you need not worry about it.  I hope this answer helps you May God bless you with a bundle of joy. Thanks.",

It may be caused by different problems like : seizures, diabetic amyotrophic or polineuropathy. It is very common during sleep, in patients with diabetes. I would recommend monitoring your blood glucose better, and have an Electroneurography and an EEG to exclude the above-mentioned disorders. If I were your doctor I would recommend treatment with clonazepam. It is a very effective Chat Doctor.  Other therapy I would recommend would be Pyrimidine, L'Oréal etc. Hope to have been of help!

      "model_response": "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your complaints and MRI spine findings. I would like to reassure you that these abnormalities are minor and do not represent any serious neurological disease. For pain relief, you can take pregabalin or gabapentin capsules. In addition, physiotherapy with IT/ultrasound and neck extension exercises would also help. In some cases, epidural injections are required for pain relief. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/",

Usually Klebsiella bacteria are pathogenic in the respiratory tract and urinary tract but not on the GIT or diarrhea. We can count these bacteria as a communal flora of the intestine and can ignore its presence in the stool. So in my opinion you should not take the Chat Doctor. Pathology for diarrhea may be something different and so can be diagnosed and treated accordingly.Maybe you have taken the long-lasting antibiotics that has washed of your communal flora. I advise you to take the probiotics like Lactobacillus spore. This help replaces the flora and can help in prevention of diarrhea. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/",

      "model_response": "Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Such a feeling is common in hernia. I suspect that you are having a hernia and content of which is the intestine. That is why bumbling sound is hearing. If the hernia is obstructing the content coming in between like spermatic cord its vessel than it may cause the erection problem. In my advice you should examine yourself with the nearby surgeon, and you can also diagnose your self with the USG examination. This will reveal the correct pathology and can be cured thereafter. Till that time you can avoid heavy exercise, the work which causes pressure on abdomen can also be avoided. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.

However in your case, you mentioned you wear retainers- that is one of the possible cause of pain. You are not supposed to wear retainers for at least two weeks till the gums over the implant heal well. Or if it is too important then your retainers must be lined by a \"soft tissue liners\" which will prevent any trauma to the underlying gums when you wear the retainer. it's not a good idea to wear retainer in post surgical phase. Avoid for two weeks and consult your dentist. Let him do a clinical examination and take an x-ray of the area. Be cautious if you see \"pus\" coming out. that's a sign of infection.

These scars are inactive, harmless, noninfectious lesions. So no treatment is required for this and no treatment is available today remove them. But for visa clearance, we need to prove that these lesions are not active and infectious. For this, you need to get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAD (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. CT is more superior in diagnosis of scar lesion as compare to chest x-ray. If both these are negative for active infection, you can argue with visa authority that these lesions are old, healed, scarred lesions and not active, infectious lesions.

If you don't have all these symptoms you may unlikely to have PID. CHLAMYDIA can be treated by DOXYCYCLINE capsules for a period of two weeks. Your sexual partners also should be treated simultaneously. Otherwise, it is useless. PID may lead to bilateral block of your Fallopian tubes and may lead to infertility.

I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to a temporomandibular joint dysfunction or a bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column, causing articular nerve pain in this region. For this reason, I would recommend performing a cervical spine MRI study. If this test results normal, I would recommend consulting with the ENT specialist for a physical exam of the temporomandibular junction. Anxiety could also play an important role on all this clinical scenario, too. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards,",

And i decided not to do because a lot of people told me radiation and chemo kill people more than cancer kill people. So i went back to draw blood and check with my doctor my CEA go back up to 26.     I would like to know am i do the right thing? just only change my diet and not listen what my doctor tell me what to do??? right now i feel just like normal person, i can go to exercise, running, walking, but i lot some weight  because i eat only fish, vegetable, and fruit.would you please, answer me what am i suppose to do?? Thank you so muchGary",

Dietary fiber as in fruits and vegetables has a protective role. However once you have the cancer it does not help much. It is true that chemotherapy and radiation have very serious side effects and can themselves cause cancer. But at stage 4 that is the best possible treatment available. I would advise you to continue with your treatment. But you can talk to your doctor if you do not wish it and ask him/her for some other palliative treatment. Hope this helps.",

He had a upper GI endoscopy done a few years ago and at that time he was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis and they also mentioned that he had lower than average lactase levels. His dairy intake is not excessive. He has a glass of milk in the morning or afternoon and occasionally pizza. I m concerned because although he has no other symptoms such as stomach discomfort or gas or bloating, his stools are really malodorous to the point where we have to have him change his underwear and shorts often for no other apparent reason. Please advise. Thank you!",
      "model_response": "The foul smelling stools could be due to overgrowth of certain bacteria in his intestines. A course of metronidazole thrice daily for 5 days should be helpful. Also give him plenty of curd. You may skip the glass of milk in the morning and give other nutritive food items instead. The primary manifestation of lactose intolerance would be bloating and abdominal distention which your child does not have. In case of celiac disease, failure to grow properly and frequency of stool are generally present.",

So in my opinion, she should get done uric acid level and if it is raised then she needs to take Eurostat tablet. Eurostat is having property of reduced uric acid production.

      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart related diseases in your case because chest constriction, neck pain and high pulse rate (94). All these favor heart diseases more. So consult doctor and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. ECG 3. 2d echo. If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Sometimes muscular spasm cannot also cause constriction feeling. So take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. But better to first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

Anyway, if he feels symptoms like dizziness, fatigue and sweating, this could be a sign that his body does not tolerate these low levels of glucose. I would recommend reducing the dose of Glycogen GP in order to have higher levels of glucose. You should know that all oral antidiabetics can lead to hypoglycemia as a common adverse effect. That is why the dose should be adjusted based on the fasting glucose levels during the day. You should discuss with his endocrinologist about the above issues. Hope to have been helpful!

Typhoid fever causes intestine infection and fluid in pelvis may be considered as complication. Patient may need surgical intervention after evaluation. Mild free fluid in pelvis in females may also be due to many other reasons like during ovulation(it is naturally seen), pelvic inflammatory disease(PID)etc. Your condition need clinical correlation.

Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour HOLDER monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation.  Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. Ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Is there any stress or anxiety associated, as it can also be a panic attack. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day.  If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiologist studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases.",

You can give ARN ICA 30, one dose daily for 3 days,it is a homoeopatChatDoctoredicine which is very good after trauma and helps in prevention of infection and early healing.

      "model_response": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The history and symptoms suggests me that you are having some food allergy, these allergens will stimulate the mast cell to release histamine which is producing all these symptoms. I would suggest you to undergo skin prick test (SPT) for different most prevalent food allergens to identify the food causing these symptoms. By doing to this it is possible to identify the allergen, by doing this you can avoid the food causing these symptoms, if it is not possible to avoid the food you can go for immunotherapy either with sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) or subcutaneous immunotherapy (SUIT).

      "model_response": "Hi, Thanks for the query. Better to go for dilatation and curettage once with your doctors' advice. This helps for diagnostic purpose, to obtain the tissue for histopathological examination. And for therapeutic purpose. By doing D&C heavy bleeding can be decreased in next cycles. If the histopathological examination shows normal tissue, no need to worry. Once check for hormonal profile and thyroid profile. If you are having regular ovulation, there may not be any problem in getting pregnancy. Track the ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. If hormonal profile is somewhat abnormal, you may need support of hormones in the early pregnancy. Take care.",

Ive also taken hpts several times but they all come back negative. also I get like a tingling sensation around my belly button. could I be pregnant?",
      "model_response": "Hello dear, I understand your concern. The first sign of pregnancy is missed period. And to confirm a urine pregnancy test need to be done a week after missed period for accurate results. The symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period. The fetal movements start around 5 months of pregnancy. The chance of pregnancy appears less with your symptoms but confirmation need to be done by urine pregnancy test. If the test is negative there is no chance of pregnancy. So relax. Avoid stress because stress also causes hormonal imbalance and delays the period. Best regards...",

In my opinion it is not an HPV.HPV never causes fluid filled blister and lymph nodes. It is other STD. Definitive diagnosis can be possible only after Grams staining from blister fluid followed by microscopic examination. You can wear condom during sex. This will prevent further transmission of infection. You can take the simultaneous treatment of HPV and other STD. Treatment for both the partner is necessary to prevent cross infection.

My last visit, I was advised to wear them only at night. I noticed significant change 2 weeks later after doing so. My teeth kept shifting. So I switched to wearing them all the time again. The shifting doesnt stop. Did I mess up?",
      "model_response": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint Orthodontic Retainers are advised to maintain the changed teeth position after achieving proper alignment of teeth post completion of orthodontic treatment. But in case if the teeth movement has started occurring and not being controlled even after increasing the time duration of wearing retainers, there is a possibility that the retainer wires have become loose and not providing sufficient pressure over the teeth leading to relapse of the maligned teeth. I would therefore suggest you to consult your Orthodontist and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and x-rays can help in diagnosis and treatment can be done accordingly. You might need a fixed orthodontic treatment followed by repeated wearing of the retainers. The orthodontist might also advise you removable orthodontic appliances for re-achievement of alignment. You should also not delay the treatment or else there can be complete relapse of misalignment and then treatment can take a long time. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.",

Use a desensitizing paste for a while. Once the teeth are cleaned and maintained well, the recession and mobility may reduce. If still persistent recession, the periodontist will plan the next treatment for recession. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards.",

      "model_response": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that due to hitting with a metal bar there has been soft tissue injury and due to injury there has been inflammation and swelling due to accumulation of inflammatory exudate and cells at the injury site. There also seems to be ruptured blood vessels leading to bruising and formation of a Hematoma. The movable gel like lump seems to be a Hematoma and is due to accumulation of blood from ruptured blood vessels. I would suggest you that you need not worry about it as it will resolve gradually. You can do alternate warm and cool compresses over the lump. You can also give him anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen. In case if there is pain numbing gel containing Lidocaine can also be advised. You can also apply Heparin gel over the area as it will help in faster disruption of the hematoma as well as bruising.

      "model_response": "Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, you should know that the back pain and the tenderness while touching could be related to chronic degeneration of the spinal column. As the pain does not radiate and is localized only in the back and at one point, it seems to be just inflammation and not a herniated disc. Coming to this point, I would recommend a thoracolumbar column X-ray study and inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate, complete blood count). Regarding the memory problems they are not related to the back pain. Working too much or lack of a balanced diet could be the causes. I would recommend regulating your daily regimen (alternate work with relax pauses, try to have a good sleeping hygiene) and take a balanced diet (full of vitamins, proteins, lipids and carboy Chat Doctor.

      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your problem and situation. In my opinion you are having mostly HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), but better to rule out cardiac cause first for your symptoms. So get done ECG and 2d echo to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal then no need to worry much for cardiac cause. It seems HERD more. Gaseous distension is also seen on HERD, and this is giving you bloating feeling of abdomen. GERD is because of laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this the acid of the stomach, tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of dull aching, burning central chest pain. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid stress and anxiety.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Start proton pump inhibitor.4. Go for walk after meals.5. Keep 2-3 pillows under your head in bed.",

Are you experiencing any symptoms like abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of your sclera and skin), fever, nausea or vomiting? Most common causes are fatty liver, chronic alcoholism, infective and obstructive (gallstones or tumor lesions) pathologies. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a gastroenterologist or a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. Diagnostics (such as ultrasound, bilirubin, blood count, etc.) and management (medical and/or surgical if indications are found) will be directed accordingly. Am also from the Philippines and my clinic is open for consultation anytime. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.",

You need to get an MRI scan of the area done and consult a neurophysician for proper diagnosis and treatment.Meanwhile, you can follow these measures:- If the pain is severe, you need bed rest till the pain resolves. - Get some analgesics prescribed and apply analgesic spray or ointments.- While resting, keep a pillow under your knees if it doesn't bother you.- Avoid lifting heavy objects.- Back strengthening exercises and stretching exercises daily as advised by a Physiotherapist.- Avoid exercises in times of pain.

      "model_response": "Good Day, and thank you for being with Chat Doctor !Your son has a congenital abnormality in his left kidney. It is called a duplicated collecting system meaning other than one tube Chat Doctor.  It will depend on if he has a complete duplication meaning he has two ureters(tube that connects the kidney to the urinary bladder) all the way from the kidney to the bladder or incomplete duplication where the two tubes will fuse somewhere in the middle and would have one insertion to the bladder. When we have a duplicated kidney we call the collecting system in the upper pole of the kidney upper moiety while the lower pole is the lower moiety. Prominence of the lower moiety means that it is more dilated than the upper pole. This means there might be some form of obstruction happening and should be investigated by CTS Can or MRI.  I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: http://www.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/",

      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Chest tightness, cough, breathing difficulty etc. in young females (33 years) is mostly due to asthma. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call. Today the right side of my tongue swelled for no reason. The emergency doctor said it (the tongue swelling) was probably something due to an allergic reaction. I am not allergic to anything!!! They found nothing sent me home saying to talk to my primary. I am 42 years of age female never smoked, been in great health. Now these items are coming up. I am scared these doctors are not finding what is wrong even with my condition. Why would my right side of my tongue swell during this? Could you please help me understand what might be causing the swelling on the right side of my tongue?",
      "model_response": "Hello, I can understand your concern. It seems that the swelling of tongue that you have developed has nothing to do with the DVT and pressure in chest you are having. I agree with your doctor that it seems to be an allergic reaction. I would advise you to take Antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) once a day for at least 5 days. If it was an allergic reaction, you should find immediate improvement in the swelling in 1-2 days. Otherwise, the cause is not allergic. The allergy could be due to anything that you have been exposed to through air, water or food. If the episodes are frequent, you should go for a blood test for allergy to find out what substance you are allergic to, and you can avoid exposure to that in the future. However, if the swelling does not decrease with the antihistamines or if it increases, then you should consult a dentist to examine the oral cavity and investigate further regarding the cause. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,",

But the symptoms came back in a worse manner just 6 months later. Again, I was put on Nexito 10mg and clonotril 0.5. Later, the medicine was changed to Fludac 20mg and then to Nexito 10 mg back again from last 1 month. I feel better for some time during medication , but if medication is off, then i return to same panic, depressed and anxiety disorders. What diagnosis do you think I have? I am 31 and married. Thanks for your answers!",
      "model_response": "Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor The medicines Felix S 10 or Escitalopram, mirtazapine 7.5 and control 0.5 are given in Depressive episode mixed with anxiety. You were given these medicines for about 2 years, so I assume that you had episode of depression. When symptoms reoccurred you were given Next or Escitalopram 10 and then fluoxetine 20. Both are of same group SSRI. Long term solution of your problem? Depression is an episodic illness, it tends to occur in intervals or in episodes. So if you responded to medicines and then relapse of disease occurred there is no surprise. You have to continue the medicines for long at least 2 years and also go for Cognitive Therapy for early response. Once you achieve pre morbid level then maintain the condition by Cognitive Therapy. Don't afraid of medicines as they are very safe Chat Doctor.  So visit a psychiatrist for opinion and continue medicines again. Thanks",

As you have chronic allergy problem, so there must be some allergic element which triggers sneezing. If I were your treating doctor then I would have advised levocetirizine for it. Also, I would have suggested montelukast once daily for one month. Blood spit occurs because of severe sneezing response. It damages the mucosal lining which in return results in blood spitting. I would also suggest you to visit an allergist for detailed examination of what is the causative allergen, and then he will prescribe immunotherapy which will resolve it, hopefully. Thank You",

      "model_response": "Hi greetings. Usually varicocele will not cause pain in scrotum. Rarely long-standing can cause some pain which will disappear after lying down. So if you are having pain we should rule out some infection in epididymis and testis situated in scrotum. Coming to the size of the Penis it is very much normal and more than enough to satisfy a woman. So to confirm consult a urologist. Hope my answer helps you. Regards",

I try to clean them regularly.",
      "model_response": "Hello, Infection of the ear-piercing can be due to wearing ear rings made of metals that are not inert in nature. Such metals decompose when exposed to air, water and can release decomposition products that can cause allergic reaction and infection. Some individuals with sensitive skin tend to get the reaction faster and can cause irritation, pain and fussing. So, first she should not wear earrings till the infection gets healed. Clean the ear-piercing site with Betadine solution and apply antiseptic ointment over it. Do cool compresses. Once it heals, she should wear earrings made of inert material like gold or plastic.

No breathing problems yet, but Im worried this is going to get worse while I sleep.  It feels like a lump in my lower throat. My tongue isnt super swollen but seems bigger that I notice it in my mouth, pressing against the front roof of my mouth. I also have been burping more than normal but do not have any burning sensation. Ive read several things but not sure what to make if it. I have a doctor appointment next week, but can you help me understand what might be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor .com. I had gone through your question I can understand your concern about your tongue. As per your history, signs and symptoms it seems to me that you are suffering with allergic reaction to your tongue and throat, or it can even be the infection to the tongue too. You don't need to worry, in case there is any difficulties in breathing you need to visit the emergency room as soon as possible. Otherwise, there is no need, sometimes because of acid regurgitation there seems to be numbness in the tongue, and you feel it is swollen, but practically it is not like that. You can have pantoprazole in morning empty stomach once daily to reduce the burping and regulations. Also take antiallergic like. Levocitrizine to reduce any sort of allergy. If you feel any breathing difficulties please visit the emergency room. Hope my answer will help you and visit us back if you have any further questions. Regards Chat Doctor.",

      "model_response": "Hi. Thanks for the query. It looks like you have inflammation inside mouth. Due to inflammation you are experiencing pain and soreness. Inflammation and soreness can be due to numerous causes, but common ones are allergy to certain foods or chemicals, deficiency of or vitamin B 12 or both, burning the inside of mouth while eating something very hot or irritation with any chemical substances or mouthwash etc. Fungal infection can be another cause. So first consult an Oral Physician and get the cause ruled out. Treatment of the same will help in relieving the oral symptoms too. For now symptoms can be managed with gargling with numbing mouthwash containing Lidocaine like Magic Mouthwash. Start taking vitamin B complex supplements daily. You can also do cool water rinses and suck ice as both of these can absorb heat and reduce inflammation. Avoid hot, acidic and spicy foods. Hope this helps. Regards.",

The strain on the muscle group must have caused a tear in the blood vessel to cause a collection of blood called hematoma.

A large hematoma needs aspiration and tight bandage, full bed rest, review with ultrasonography for the progress. Antibiotic may not be necessary if the skin is intact.

      "model_response": "Hii have gone through your question and I can understand your concern about fever ant UTI.as there is pus cell and bacteria present in urine it clears that you got a urinary track infection and your fever is also due to this. Before going to any conclusion I would like to ask you some question1) is there is weight loss in past few days?2) do you fell weakness?3) is there is any person in your surrounding who is suffering from tuberculosis.in almost all the cases of urinary track tuberculosis picture is almost same like yours. There is puss cell there is microorganism there is fever, but there is nothing in culture because tuberculosis bacteria need a special culture media for its growth, and it also takes more than usual time to growth.I will suggest you to go for a urine AFB test also request for culture for M.TB.also get an ultrasound done for your kidney hoping this information will help you and send the answer for my questions as soon as possible so that I can help regards Chat Doctor.",

You may get the X-ray/MRI, some blood tests and joint fluid analysis under his/her guidance to reach the accurate diagnosis. Use heat and cold to manage pain. Both heat and cold can relieve pain in your joint. Heat also relieves stiffness and cold can relieve muscle spasms. Apply over-the-counter pain creams. Creams and gels available at the Chat Doctor. Take diet rich in calcium, vitamin d3 and minerals. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care",

      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. HERD is common in depression and panic disorder. Both of these cause laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of Central chest pain. So proper treatment of depression and panic disorder is needed. So consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. Start proton pump inhibitors. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food.  Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

Is this typical after radiation? What is the cure if it is scarring and what is the cure rate if it is cancer.",
      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Scarring is more common after radiation than cancer. So for your symptoms, possibility of bladder scarring is more than bladder cancer. But biopsy is must differentiate between these two. So get done biopsy for the diagnosis. If it is scarring then treatment is available and your problem can be solved. But if it turned out to be malignant then you need to get done staging of the cancer. Future treatment will be decided on staging of the tumor only. Early stages of bladder cancer is having good prognosis with life expectancy of 6-7 years. End stage bladder cancer is having life expectancy of less than 2 years. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

Based on your query data, In my opinion, Dear You seem to suffer from Varsity of the Short Saphenous Vein with multiple bumpy swellings on shin/ankle on one leg. Burning pain sensation is due to rural neuropathy due to pressure from engorged Varicose Lumps and stretch of the surrounding soft tissue. Multiple injuries could only expedite the basic defect of Varicose Veins in your case, but should not be directly correlated to cause the burning swellings on shin and near ankles. So your suspicion is wrong and could be confirmed by second opinion to evaluate your case clinically. Color Doppler study would confirm this. For this treatment GP and Surgeon and Vascular Surgeon team would be needed to treat your case. Hope this reply would help you to evaluate your case and treat it with your doctors in time to come. Hope this would resolve your query and worry and Anxiety accompanied by it. Welcome for any further query in this regard to ME. I would love to help you out.Awaiting any further query.

However since it is a small one doesn't explain all your symptoms. Coming to the eye issue, given the fact that the symptoms surface when you read it could well be the cause.

What could be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern.... As her your complaint it seems that you have a DISLOCATED JAW JOINT [TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT DISLOCATION] leading to painful movement and bulging of the articulating portion of mandibular bone in front of the ear, and it can occur due to trauma, opening the mouth too wide for multiple reasons. You should consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and get an ORTHOPANTOMOGRAM [OPG] done so that the exact status of the jaw joint can be evaluated and treatment can be planned. You can be referred to an ORAL SURGEON who can manually re-locate your jaw into the anatomical position but in case if it is not successful you may need a surgery for re-locating your jaw. Hope this information helps. If you find the answer helpful please give me a Five-Star Review and click on found the answer helpful as a token of appreciation. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. .",

If I were your doctor, I would have advised you to keep a close watch on her level of consciousness to see if she is responding normally to your routine talks with her, and if she is moving her limbs normally, and has not got any vomiting. The bump on her head is due to collection of blood by the injury, and will subside gradually. In case of any change in the level of consciousness of hers to your commands, and any increase in the bump on the head, I would advise you to take her to the ER room of the nearest hospital, where they would examine her closely and if considered necessary might go for some investigations like a CT scan to rule out any concealed head injury. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.",

I have seen a urologist and had a CT scan and an x-ray and they found nothing, went back for a cystoctomy to scope the inside of my bladder and found nothing unusual. I did find out after the x-ray and CT scan that I only have one kidney; I never knew that. I have no abdominal or back pain, nor do I have pain during urination, I only know that something came out when I look into the toilet. I called my urologist after this happened again, I acquired a sample to bring in, they told me its probably a blood clot and not to worry about it and not to bring in the sample. I also have a hydrocele/vericocele on my right spermatic chord. What could be causing these brown particles in my urine?",
      "model_response": "HelloThanks for query. Based on your statement that you have posted the brown particle that you have passed in urine hours after ejaculating is likely to be a blood clot mixed with urine which gets turned up into brown color. In the majority of cases this blood clots originates from a small superficial surface of prostate and gets sealed off itself immediately that causes a tiny blood clot to appear either in semen or urine passes after ejaculation. Since this is single episode and all the tests like C. T scan, X-ray and Cystoscopy did not reveal any pathological lesion you should not worry about it. If you have pain or discomfort due to Varicocele that you have on Rt side use scrotal support. This will prevent sagging of testicles and give relief from pain or discomfort. Chat Doctor.",

But since u out have pain going into both legs' possibility of disc prolapse or canal stenosis is more likely and seems a different condition from UTI.  Are there any difficulties in walking or tingling and numbness in both the legs? If yes then it also points towards canal stenosis.  You need to be investigated with MRI of lumbosacral spine with screening of whole spine as it gives detail information of discs, nerves and even bone. Visit radiology center nearby you and get it done. Visit spine surgeon with report.  Meanwhile, start tab diclofenac plus thiocolchicoside combination twice a day for pain relief plus tab vita B12 plus pregabalin 75 mg at bedtime for 10 days.

      "model_response": "Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. Your child has fever and vomiting, this could be due acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. In my opinion, you should give syrup of lox (5ml =50 mg) 5 ml three times a day for 3 days, paracetamol syrup for fever and syrup risperidone 4 ml for vomiting. If child develops loose stools, then you should also start ORS solution regularly. Review back after 2 days. I hope this will help you. Take care. Regards: Chat Doctor.",

Could you please tell me what diagnosis or condition she might have based on these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "Hi & Welcome to Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concern for your beloved daughter. Since she has already received FOUR doses of anti rabies vaccine on the days 0,3,7, & 14 following the dog bite and the street dog according to her found to be healthy even after 14 days, she is protected against rabies.Besides, she was also injected anti rabies immunoglobulin at the wound, so there is nothing to worry. The anti rabies vaccines are generally found to be safe, side effects like body ache, fever can occur which can be managed by giving medicine like paracetamol to reduce the body temperature. Another possibility is she might have developed wound infection resulting in fever and for which antibiotics were prescribed, let her complete the course of the antibiotics and paracetamol the fever will subside soon.

Although it is not typical of occipital neuralgia that the pain is triggered by standing up position. Intracranial Hypotension could cause such symptomatology. Anyway, I would recommend having some rest and taking plenty of fluids in the next days. A close monitoring of your blood pressure is also necessary to exclude low blood pressure. But if your situation does not improve, I would recommend consulting with your doctor for a physical check up, a brain CT scan and a complete blood count for anemia. Hope to have been helpful!

Would doxycycline be more appropriate give the fact that klebsiella devolpes resistance to cephalosporin relatively quickly. How quickly I am not sure. She has not measured her temperature, but says she feels clammy.Thank you",
      "model_response": "Dear Friend. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. See, the sensitivity depends on the culture. If the klebsiella is sensitive to cephalosporins then Cefuroxime would help good. There is no need of adding doxycycline to her. In fact, if her fever responds well to this antibiotic, let her complete course for at least 7 days. Some doctors also prefer to give treatment for 14 days. If her fever doesn't responds then adding a quinolone like Levofloxacin would be an appropriate decision. This is my personal opinion for you based on available details.

I understand your concern and would explain that dark stools are very concerning about a gastrointestinal hemorrhage (related to diverticulitis or any other disorders). Your past medical history for diverticulitis and colon cancer could be related to these symptoms. But a common viral gastroenteritis as the cause of this symptomatology can not be excluded. I recommend consulting with your gastroenterologist for a careful physical examination, an abdominal ultrasound, a stool analysis, some lab blood tests including: a complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, CEA, CA19.9 (tumor antigens), etc. A GI endoscopy is necessary to exclude possible lesions of the digestive tract if suspicions are raised.

      "model_response": "HiT hank you for asking ChatDoctorI have gone through your query. During fall on back you can possibly get a muscle strain or ligament sprain of back or a vertebral injury like disc bulge. An examination with orthopedic will give clue for that and an X-ray followed by MRI if needed of Lumbosacral spine should be done to confirm that. I usually prescribe NSAIDs like Diclofenac muscle relaxants like Thiocolchicoside and neurotrophic Chat Doctor. After a rest of short duration of 4-5 days I advise physiotherapy also. Hope this may help you. Let me know if you have any further query.",

Possibility of heart disease is less but better to rule out cardiac diseases first for your symptoms. So get done ECG and 2d echo. If both are normal than no need to worry about heart diseases. Possibility of antibiotic induced gastritis is more. You're all symptoms like burping, discomfort in stomach, chest pain etc. are seen in gastritis. And antibiotics are known to cause gastritis. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.  But first rule out cardiac diseases. Hope I have solved your query.

I would advise you to visit to an ENT Specialist and get complete checkup done and take treatment for sinusitis. Apply colonel ointment topically over the affected area on tongue. Take saline water gargles 3-4 times a day. For broken tooth go crown placement , restoration depending upon the condition of tooth. Hope this helps out. Regards....",

The OSF can be treated with Erbium Chromium Yttrium Scandium Gallium Garnet (Err:YEGG) laser which shows promising results. Consult a good oral maxillofacial surgeon and get it treated. The SM FI BRO is an Antonio, the dose you are taking is fine. You can take this for 15 days to a month. Once the mouth opening is achieved you can get the wisdom tooth removed.

      "model_response": "Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. It is quite common for it to pain after severe cough. Do not worry. It seems to be a viral illness.  Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (Maximum ceiling dose 500 mg per dose) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Regards -",

      "model_response": "Dear patient. Greetings from Chat Doctor !!!  I am Chat Doctor and shall be answering your question. I can understand your reservations about blood transfusion and when it should be done. Furthermore, I will try my best to answer your question and guide you through the problem. Your sister has an HE of 3.5gm/DL. The normal HE for her is 12gm/DL. Her anemia can be multifactorial, blood loss due to fibroid, nutritional, menstrual loss. HE of 3.5gm/DL is a very low hemoglobin. The body goes into a state of high output cardiac failure and blood is not able to deliver enough oxygen to the tissues. Oxygen is a basic requirement of the cells. Hypoxia leads to accumulation of acids in the blood and the patient feels tired and breathless. Hence, I would recommend your sister be transfused with a total of 3 to 4 packed cells to get the HE till 7gm/DL. She can then be treated for the cause. She can then be given hepatitis, intravenous iron and treated for fibroid if any. Current day transfusions are safe and the risk of acquiring diseases is minimal. Hence, you shouldn't worry about that, I hope this helps you out. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to write back to me. Yours sincerely, ChatDoctor.",

CBG typically presents around the age of 60. The youngest ever documented case has manifested at the age of 34 (I rechecked before answering just to be sure). So if your son had that disease at 38 with manifestations starting at 35, he would be an almost unique case in the history of the disease, I would be really careful in taking that diagnosis. As for the distinction between MS and stroke related to the head trauma it should generally be easy with an MRI if history and examination do not already make that distinction. Without knowing more about the signs and MRI report it's hard for me to say something more because these diseases can have many presentations. The seizure would direct more towards the head trauma rather than MS, as would the fact that the deficit has remained constant in time since the hit, without new signs, as you seem to suggest, but as I said MRI and more details are needed.

      "model_response": "Hi, there is increased chance of uterine rupture After mastectomy if you become pregnant soon. So, to heal the scar, 6 months to one year gap is recommended.  But as you have got pregnant, be a little aware that after 8 months starting, you should be cautious of any pain in abdomen.  Visit a doctor immediately if pain is there. Baby will require delivery by cesarean in most of the cases. Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.",

      "model_response": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint the blister that has caused to you is due to pus formation below the root tips of the infected tooth which at times perforates the bone and appears as a blister below the soft tissues. It is a painful condition, but you should not prick or burst the blister as it will be further painful. You should take antibiotics like Augmenting 625 mg three times a day and Tramadol 5Omg thrice a day and Pantoprazole 4Omg empty stomach once in morning.... You can apply numbing gel over the blister for local relief. You should continue with the medicine for 5 days and by then get the root canal started so that the pus finds a way to discharge, and the condition will relieve. Hope this information helps.

Do you have any cardio-vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, etc.)? I would recommend consulting with an ENT specialist for a careful physical check up and performing labyrinthine tests. A brain MRI may be needed, especially if you have known cardio-vascular risk factors. Meanwhile, I would recommend having some rest and take plenty of fluids to remain well HY Chat Doctor.  Linearizing or betahistine may be helpful. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes,",

You are suffering from Secondary Amenorrhea for last 6 months.Also, you are trying to conceive, and you got last period 6 m ago after taking MPA. There are several causes. First exclude possible pregnancy by doing blood test for Chat Doctor. Other causes are POD (more common), thyroid dysfunction, over wt or under wt, psychological problems, eating disorder, certain Chat Doctor. So do some primary investigations to evaluate underlying pathology. Those are USG lower abdomen, LH/FSH, blood estrogen & Progesterone level, PPBS, blood prolactin, thyroid & lipid profile. After all investigations, consult with your doctor, and you will be treated accordingly. One thing you should be concerned that MPA can cause irregular/delayed menstrual cycle or long time infertility after discontinuation. Besides, you control your body wt by regular exercise, take healthy diet with avoidance of fatty food, avoid stress, take proper sleep along with vitae & nutrient supplements. Be well.",

      "model_response": "Hi dear, When a herniated disc occurs, it can release pressure on nearby spinal nerves and the spinal cord, causing unpleasant painful symptoms, very common ones are neck pain, radiating arm pain, shoulder pain, and numbness or tingling in the arm or hand. Pain by patients are general explained as dull, aching, and difficult to localize to sharp, burning, and easy to pinpoint. Pain in your arms as well as in your neck is usually the first sign that your nerve roots are irritated by a problem in your neck. Symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and especially weakness in the muscles of your arms, are warning signs that your problem may be more serious. Weakness in your arms is a definite sign that you should see a doctor about your neck pain. So i don't think it's a heart attack sign neither a stroke. Not all patients with herniated disc require surgery. Patient can find symptomatic relief through non-surgical therapies such as exercise, medication, physiotherapy. I will really advise you to meet your consulting doctor for further management and proper treatment.I may also feel from your questing that this problem has limited your life/daily work to some degree, I can give you my honest opinion that in my clinical practice I have seen attest 95 % patient getting relief from physiotherapy and conservative management.I hope you will carry on with the treatment .TAKE CARE.",

So please do a renal artery Doppler to see whether you have kidney artery disease. Another reason is a condition Called pheochromocytoma. It is a being tumor of the Chat Doctor.  To detect that a CT abdomen can be done. So my advice is first to do a renal artery Doppler and if it is normal then a CT abdomen. Meanwhile, your BP medications should be added and changed.

Im using dobovate cream on it at the moment. do you think the baths might be the cause problem. Is there anything else you would recommend?",
      "model_response": "Hi, As you said you suffer from psoriasis and that is worsened after treatment of lichen sclerosis. You also have doubt that daily bathing is responsible. I would like to say about few lines for psoriasis.... Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing and autoimmune disease. There may be scaly plaques on various parts of the body, scaly lesions on the scalp and sometimes joint pain may be there due to politic arthritis. Exact cause is not known. Genetic tendency, autoimmunitity, stress, Chat Doctor. .etc. may be responsible for precipitation and exacerbation of the disease. You did not say what treatment you took for lichen sclerosis. If your doctor has given oral steroids or steroid injections for lichen sclerosis.that would have worsened the psoriasis. I do not believe that daily bath is responsible. I usually recommend cap accretion 10 mg twice a day along with methotrexate 15 mg weekly in three decided doses 12 hourly. This may be taken for long time till good response. Blood tests may be done to monitor the treatment. Apply mild steroid cream or calcitriol point on the lesions. For scalp psoriasis, tar shampoo may be done. You may apply moisturizer to improve the skin texture. Avoid soap bath for few weeks. Avoid stress and worries as that might worsen psoriasis. I hope you got my answer. Thanks.",

      "model_response": "Hello, Thanks for your query. It seems you are suffering from degenerative disc disease & it occurs due to repetitive overload or stress to the disc & it increases the risk of disc herniation & spinal canal stenosis. The main treatment of such pain is bed rest along with painkillers and muscle relaxants. Muscle relaxants can help with your symptoms if used in appropriate dosage in combination with a potent analgesic. You can get the appropriate Chat Doctor. Meanwhile, you can follow these measures:- If the pain is severe, you need bed rest till the pain resolves. - Get some analgesics prescribed and apply analgesic spray or ointments.- While resting, keep a pillow under your knees if it doesn't bother you.- Avoid lifting heavy objects.- Back strengthening exercises and stretching exercises daily as advised by a Physiotherapist.- Avoid exercises in times of pain. - Improvise your posture while sitting.- Using an LS contour belt of appropriate size might be helpful in providing support to back muscles. Also, maintain a proper posture while working, sitting and standing. Keep your back straight. Physiotherapy plays a major role in treating such conditions. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care",

According to your description, there is almost nil possibility to have traumatic injury causing erectile dysfunction in your case. Let me know whether you achieve and maintain an erection in sleep, in the early morning or during masturbation then there is no need to be worried about. It is likely due to performance anxiety. For continuous erection, there must be constant erotic/romantic thoughts, feelings, and sensations in your mind. If your mind is diverted to concern about erection, you will lose erection or have delayed or no erection. This failure causes you worried more during next time and again makes you focusing on your erection rather than enjoying erotic feelings. You may read Senate focus on internet. I suggest psychological counseling with psychiatrist. Wish you good health.",

I think this was caused from 8 months or more of loneliness and isolation at school, having no friends. I also have social phobia, an eating disorder, sleeping disorder, crossed-eyes, and more weird and strange diseases. D: Can you tell me what diagnosis fits my symptoms?",

My aunt emailed this morning and said: The Emergency room doctor told us that his heart was beating but his brain was dead and all doctors in the room decided to stop to help him. I have two questions which I m seeking an opinion on: 1. If a brain is dead, can the heart continue to function for a long period of time? In this case, I think it had to be 20 minutes from the time of the accident to the time the ambulance arrived at the ER. 2. Wasn t termination of further medical assistance really up to the next-of-kin? I m just looking for a simple explanation or non-binding opinion. Any assistance on this matter that you could extend to me would be appreciated. I have to go visit my aunt on Tuesday and I d like to have these answers so that I go with some peace of mind before I see her and make her more upset than she already is. Could you please help me understand what this condition means and what diagnosis might apply?",
      "model_response": "Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. If your cousin is diagnosed with brain death (there are examinations that determine it, EEG, cerebral and brain stem reflexes absent, etc.) then his heart can beat for an indefinite time if there is medical support, if no heart will stop soon. The time that human brain resists without oxygen is 3 to 5 minutes, beyond this time (without blood and oxygen) happens brain death and if the diagnosis is correct there is nothing to do to help him. Sorry I have to say this. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us.

      "model_response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having acute exacerbation (worsening) of asthma. This is the cause for your constant cough, weakness and breathlessness. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of asthma is based on severity only. You will need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol, albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide or fluticasone). Combination of antihistamine and anti-allergic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",
