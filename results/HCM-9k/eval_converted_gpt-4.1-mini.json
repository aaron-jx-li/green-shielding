      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **mild acute hepatitis, probably drug-induced or viral in origin**, causing transient elevation of SGPT (ALT).\n\nExplanation:\n- Elevated SGPT (ALT) indicates hepatocellular injury.\n- Mild fatty liver on ultrasound is unlikely to cause such a high ALT (194 IU/L) alone.\n- Recent episodes of loose stools treated with antibiotics (ofloxacin and ornidazole) could cause transient liver enzyme elevation due to drug-induced liver injury.\n- Recent cold and cough raise the possibility of a viral infection (e.g., viral hepatitis or other viral illnesses) causing transient hepatitis.\n- No history of alcohol or other chronic liver disease risk factors.\n- Normal other liver function tests and imaging suggest no chronic liver disease.\n\nIn summary, the elevated SGPT is most likely due to a recent mild acute hepatitis, either viral or drug-induced, which is usually reversible. This should be monitored with repeat liver function tests. It may not necessarily affect employment clearance if it normalizes and no chronic liver disease is present.",

MS commonly presents with recurrent sensory disturbances affecting limbs and face, often with episodes separated in time and space.\n\nFurther neurological evaluation and MRI imaging are warranted to confirm the diagnosis.",

Can you please tell me what might be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **Giardiasis** (Giardia lamblia infection).\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Increased stool frequency, often after eating or drinking milk, suggests malabsorption or intolerance triggered by infection.\n- Foul-smelling stools and mouth odor are characteristic of giardiasis due to malabsorption and fermentation.\n- History of consuming potentially contaminated food (uncooked chicken) during travel supports exposure to a protozoal pathogen.\n- Lack of improvement with cephalosporin (an antibiotic ineffective against protozoa) further supports a parasitic cause.\n- Vomiting may be part of the gastrointestinal upset.\n\nGiardiasis commonly presents with diarrhea, steatorrhea, and foul-smelling stools, especially in children after exposure to contaminated food or water.",

      "input": "Hello, I recently developed a very itchy penis which when I itch, leads to red patchs which sometimes become red and glossy. It is very irritable and causes pain when i have intercourse. I also have developed itchy thighs.. It started just at the top and has now developed over most of my thighs. The itching comes and goes and shows in small patches , not lumps but itchy red spots. i am worried that it is an std as i have had a lot of unprotected sex recently (lesson learnt) but the symptoms don t relate to any std so i m puzzled!? i also have what i thought was joggers nipple? very itchy nipple and also my face sometimes has dry patches on the eyelids and near the hair receding line? It has been going on for the last 3 months and as i m still in China and not a native speaker, i can t really find any treatment or diagnosis. please help?",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **atopic dermatitis (eczema)** with involvement of multiple typical sites (genital area, upper thighs, nipples, and face). \n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n- Chronic pruritus with red, glossy patches on the penis and upper thighs.\n- Intermittent itchy red patches without nodules.\n- Nipple involvement resembling \"jogger's nipple\" (a form of irritant dermatitis).\n- Dry patches on the face and eyelids, common in atopic dermatitis.\n- The distribution and morphology are typical for eczema rather than a sexually transmitted infection.\n- The history of unprotected sex does not strongly correlate with the described symptoms, which lack classic signs of STIs (e.g., ulcers, discharge, systemic symptoms).\n\nOther differentials like candidiasis, psoriasis, or lichen planus are less likely given the widespread distribution and clinical description.\n\n**Summary:** Atopic dermatitis (eczema) with genital, thigh, nipple, and facial involvement.",

Fact or Fiction: Amoebic dysentery has been eradicated in North America. Amoeba and trophozoites cannot be seen by the naked eye. Amoeba generally float on top of the toilet water, easily visible. Standard O&P lab tests cannot detect amoebas and trophozoites. The infected stool must be submitted to a lab that has the special equipment and appropriately trained personnel in order to detect amoebic dysentery disease. Two or more antibiotics will be necessary to eliminate such parasites; long term if the host has been infected over a long period of time. Could you please tell me if these symptoms and facts indicate that I might have amoebic dysentery?",

The right shoulder pain can be referred pain from a liver abscess, a common complication of invasive amoebic infection.\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n- Presence of intestinal symptoms consistent with amoebic colitis.\n- Possible liver involvement causing referred right shoulder pain.\n- Diagnosis is often confirmed by identifying *Entamoeba histolytica* cysts or trophozoites in stool samples.\n- Standard O&P (ova and parasite) tests can detect amoebas but may require multiple samples for accuracy.\n- Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics such as metronidazole followed by a luminal agent (e.g., paromomycin) to eradicate both invasive and intestinal forms.\n\nTherefore, amoebic dysentery is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.",

An emergency room physician can assess acute symptoms but definitive diagnosis and management require specialist care, including imaging (e.g., panoramic X-ray, CT scan) and possibly biopsy or culture of the lesions.\n\nIn summary, chronic osteomyelitis of the jaw secondary to severe dental pathology is the most likely diagnosis.",

A few days ago, I started having a sore throat and I was wondering if there could be any corrolation. I cannot remember if the last time this happened was during a time at which I had a sore throat. So far, no unexplained bruising has occured on my stomach, back, chest , etc and very rarely on my arms (though I assume that it s only unexplained because I don t remember hitting something). However, the bruises which have just appeared are not in any place I would bump into. I m a 21 year old otherwise healthy female. The only concering aspect of my medical history is that my mother, my half-sister, and my grandfather on my father s side have all died from cancer . Two cases of melanoma and one of colon cancer. Could the bruising be a result of my sore throat? Or should I be seeing a doctor?",

No instant swelling that I noted (adrenalin) but did feel pain, I admit I kept playing so did weightbear after falls..first fall of significance in first half. Knee started to stiffen up and get more painful towards end of match, knee noticeably swelling and real discomfort on car home and painful to sleep, ache walking and stairs or kneeling painful...used price technique straight away..iced it straight away, tubrigrip compression and elevated..knee now feels better..widespread bruising tender on palpation of joint line/bruises, knee not as stiff but still an ache at end range flexion swelling has reduced. I think when the bruising goes the dull ache in my knee should go too, I feel I dont need physio or medical intervention as its only been 3 days since injury and to let healing process take its course? Am I foolish or should I check if ligaments/cartilage isnt Injured even though the symptoms/mechanism don t match? Thanks",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is a **knee contusion with possible bone bruise and/or meniscal injury**.\n\nExplanation:\n- The injury involved repeated high-impact falls on the knee, which commonly cause contusions or bone bruises.\n- Initial absence of swelling followed by delayed swelling and stiffness is typical of soft tissue injury and bone bruise rather than acute ligament rupture, which usually causes immediate swelling and instability.\n- Persistent joint line tenderness raises suspicion for a meniscal injury, which can occur with twisting or impact but may have a more subtle onset.\n- Ligament injury is less likely without instability or a clear twisting mechanism.\n- The improvement with RICE and reduced swelling supports a soft tissue injury rather than a severe ligament tear.\n\nFurther evaluation with physical exam tests and possibly MRI may be needed to rule out meniscal or cartilage injury definitively.",

In the beginning the frequency of reoccurance was after 4 to 6 months, but now its occuring again and again within 15 to 20 days. I have the following symptoms. C1)fatigue, Feeling discomfort and tired always2)nausea always. Sensation is more after few minutes of food intake3)severe pain in lower right abdomen4)feeling burning pain in all over the abdomenal area5)Getting constipation for few days and then loose motion for few days Have done abdomincal scan and showed results as1)Left renal stone2)Minimal fluid in cul de sac Have done blood, urine and stool tests and reports showed these1)Haemoglobin is low2)ESR is high - 343)Showed pus cells in stool, occassional and stool is brown in color.4)showed 1-2 leucocytes and 2-3 epithelial cells in urineMenstrual periods  regular(30-32). Can you please tell me what might be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **Chronic Appendicitis** or a chronic inflammatory condition of the right lower abdomen such as **Ileitis (possibly Crohn's disease)**.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- **Right lower abdominal pain for 2 years** with temporary relief from antibiotics suggests a chronic inflammatory or infectious process.\n- Increasing frequency of pain episodes and associated systemic symptoms (fatigue, nausea) point to a chronic condition.\n- Alternating bowel habits (constipation and loose stools) and burning abdominal pain suggest possible involvement of the terminal ileum or colon.\n- Brown-colored stool with occasional pus cells indicates some degree of intestinal inflammation or infection.\n- Elevated ESR (34) and low hemoglobin suggest chronic inflammation and possible anemia of chronic disease.\n- Minimal fluid in the cul-de-sac and a left renal stone are likely incidental findings.\n- Urine microscopy is relatively unremarkable, making urinary tract infection less likely.\n- Regular menstruation rules out gynecological causes like endometriosis as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Summary:** The clinical picture is consistent with a chronic inflammatory bowel condition such as Crohn's disease affecting the terminal ileum or chronic appendicitis. Given the chronicity, bowel symptoms, and inflammatory markers, **Crohn's disease (terminal ileitis)** is the most likely diagnosis. Further evaluation with colonoscopy and imaging (CT/MRI enterography) is warranted.",

The protrusion of the third rib noted by the doctor may indicate abnormal rib movement or prominence. Symptoms such as chest pain, breathlessness, and palpitations (skipped heartbeats) during episodes are consistent with irritation of intercostal nerves or mechanical irritation affecting nearby structures. Normal chest X-rays are typical, as this is a functional/musculoskeletal issue rather than a structural lung or cardiac problem.",

I have consulted many doctors, neurologists, they gave many stress relieving medicines along with vitamins but nothing helped even a bit.

Can you please tell me what might be causing these symptoms?",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS)** of the calves. \n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n- Chronic, bilateral, below-knee calf pain lasting years.\n- Pain worsens with prolonged standing and activity.\n- Morning stiffness and difficulty initiating movement.\n- Symptoms localized to calf muscles.\n- Lack of response to stress medications and vitamins.\n- Subjective feelings of lifelessness and fatigue related to muscle pain.\n\nCECS is characterized by increased pressure within the muscle compartments during activity, leading to pain, tightness, and sometimes neurological symptoms. It often presents with exercise-induced calf pain and stiffness, which can persist and cause functional impairment.\n\nOther considerations like fibromyalgia or depression may explain fatigue and low mood but do not typically cause localized, activity-related calf pain with stiffness.\n\nFurther diagnostic confirmation can be done with compartment pressure testing.",

It can present with a small bulge or localized tenderness but without a true hernia on imaging. The pain typically worsens with activities that increase abdominal wall tension, such as prolonged sitting. The history of trauma (bicycle fall) can precipitate nerve entrapment.

Again negative. But she still asked me to test the next day with early morning urine to be sure. And only then start Primolut-N 5mg tabs for 3 days thrice a day. The next test was also negative taken on preganews. Now its been 3 days have stopped the tab and no sign of periods. We are TTC for past 4 months. So what could be the reason for delayed periods and also is it possible that the HPTs are negative but I am still pregnant. Thanks in advance.",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **anovulatory cycle with delayed menstruation (secondary amenorrhea)**, possibly due to hormonal imbalance or luteal phase defect.\n\nKey points supporting this:\n- Prolonged cycle day 58 with delayed menstruation.\n- Multiple negative pregnancy tests, including early morning urine and clinical tests, effectively ruling out pregnancy.\n- No menstruation after a short course of Primolut-N (a progestogen used to induce withdrawal bleeding).\n- Short duration of trying to conceive (4 months), which is within normal limits for fertility evaluation but suggests early investigation.\n\nThis pattern suggests the patient is not ovulating regularly, leading to delayed or absent menstruation despite no pregnancy. Further evaluation of ovulation (e.g., serum progesterone, ultrasound follicular monitoring) and hormonal profile (TSH, prolactin, FSH, LH) is warranted.",

      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is a **diabetic foot ulcer** complicated by poor wound healing. The initial blood blister (likely a diabetic bullae or hemorrhagic blister) progressed to an ulcer after incision and skin excision. In diabetes, impaired wound healing due to neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and infection risk is common, leading to chronic non-healing ulcers. The concern about gangrene is valid, but the description suggests a chronic diabetic ulcer rather than established gangrene at this stage.",

      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory cycles related to PCOS** with possible mid-cycle spotting (ovulation spotting). \n\nExplanation:\n- PCOS commonly causes irregular or infrequent ovulation, leading to irregular or minimal menstrual flow.\n- Spotting around mid-cycle (about day 14-16 in a typical cycle) can correspond to ovulation bleeding, which is usually benign.\n- Regular but minimal flow suggests some endometrial shedding but possibly suboptimal ovulation.\n- Clomiphene citrate is used to induce ovulation in PCOS patients, but ovulation may still be irregular.\n- Fertility can be affected by PCOS due to anovulation, but with treatment and monitoring, conception is possible.\n\nIn summary, her spotting 15 days ago likely represents ovulation bleeding, and her PCOS-related ovulatory dysfunction is the main issue affecting fertility. Further ovulation monitoring (e.g., basal body temperature, ovulation predictor kits, ultrasound) is recommended to confirm ovulation and optimize conception chances.",

He had a colonoscopy done and they found nothing to even suggest he has diverticulitis. They also eliminated Crohn s and Celiac disease. The only thing we have noticed that aggravates the pain is steak so he avoids it but still has the pain. He describes it as a bruised feeling. It s a dull pain unless he eats something that aggravates it or if the area is touched then it is a sharp pain, and he says it s not a cramping pain at all, just a very bad bruised feeling.

Further evaluation with cardiac workup, imaging, and gastrointestinal assessment is warranted.\n\nIf forced to choose one diagnosis based on the symptoms, **costochondritis** (inflammation of the rib cartilage) is a common cause of sharp chest and rib pain that can mimic asthma symptoms but does not explain dizziness well.

He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body? Sorry about this being such a long messge but we are at a wits end as to finding out what is causing this problem.  Could you possibly help us by offering your guidance about the fluid? What do you think might be causing this fluid buildup?",

This can cause increased intra-abdominal pressure, abdominal distension, and diaphragmatic elevation resulting in shortness of breath.\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n- History of peritoneal dialysis catheter repositioning due to initial malposition.\n- Persistent abdominal fluid retention and increased girth despite dialysis.\n- Symptoms consistent with fluid accumulation causing diaphragmatic pressure.\n- Reintroduction of hemodialysis did not reduce abdominal fluid, suggesting ongoing peritoneal fluid retention rather than systemic fluid overload.\n- Possibility of catheter leak or malfunction causing incomplete dialysate drainage.\n\nFurther evaluation with peritoneal dialysis catheter function tests, imaging (e.g., contrast study), and assessment of peritoneal membrane function is warranted to confirm catheter patency and rule out leaks or obstruction.",

My father has been suffering from high blood pressure and two weeks ago his pulse was at 125 for a number of days.  This landed him in the hospital for about 10 days. He was diagnosed with atrial fibralation as well as anxiety and chronic fatigue.  Both he and the rest of my family have been taking care of my mother who is has a terminally ill with cancer.  He is on a number of medications now and is taking Lisinipril and cumodin and other meds.  His cumodin level was high this week.  He walked to the store the other day and had to ask for a ride back as he wasnt feeling well.  The hospice nurse took his blood pressure and pulse today: 153/100, pulse 50.  She said that he should get checked out again soon as something does not appear right with his meds.  Could you please help us understand what might be going on with his condition?  My father is 79 years old.  Thank you.  Melinda",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **bradycardia due to over-anticoagulation and possible medication-induced sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular (AV) block**.\n\nExplanation:\n- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin (warfarin) with a high coumadin level, increasing the risk of bleeding and possibly affecting overall health.\n- He initially had a sustained tachycardia (125 bpm) from atrial fibrillation, but now presents with bradycardia (pulse 50 bpm) and symptoms of weakness and fatigue.\n- The bradycardia and symptoms after exertion suggest possible medication side effects (e.g., beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers if added recently), or progression to sinus node dysfunction or AV block, which can occur in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation.\n- The elevated blood pressure and low pulse rate indicate hemodynamic compromise.\n- The hospice nurse's concern about medication effects supports the likelihood of drug-induced bradycardia or conduction system disease.\n\nIn summary, the patient likely developed symptomatic bradycardia due to medication effects or progression of conduction disease in the setting of atrial fibrillation and over-anticoagulation.",

Since the patient took the pill continuously for about five weeks, the endometrium may not have built up enough to shed, resulting in no withdrawal bleeding despite a negative pregnancy test.

The involvement of large joints and the toe could also suggest overlapping gout or pseudogout, but combined with systemic symptoms, RA is more likely.\n\n- **Muscle tenderness and decreased strength:** Inflammatory arthritis can cause periarticular muscle weakness and tenderness.\n\n- **Increased hair loss, very dry skin, tingling sensation:** These are common in autoimmune thyroid disease (hypothyroidism) or systemic autoimmune conditions.\n\n- **Severe nocturnal calf cramps:** Can be related to electrolyte imbalances or neuropathy associated with autoimmune disease.\n\n- **Episodes of hot flashes followed by chills:** Could indicate autonomic dysfunction or systemic inflammation.\n\n- **Profound fatigue:** Common in systemic autoimmune diseases like RA and thyroid disorders.\n\n**Summary:** The constellation of joint symptoms, systemic features, and a neck lump near the larynx strongly suggests rheumatoid arthritis with possible autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis).

I have had brain MRI, Ct scans, EKGs, carotid dopppler, blood chemistries and all appear to be within normal range, with the exception of Vit D, I have added 5,000IU/day. However, about 2 weeks ago, I had an episode of hypocalcemia, confirmed by Trousseau s sign, periorbital parysthesia, etc.. (but total serum calcium was normal).

Blood sugar fasting- 100 (86) Free T 0.96 (0.99) ng/dl. Bilirubin 1.7 (2.1) v mg/dl Exercise 2 to 4 times a week about an hr. each time. Could you please tell me what diagnosis these results suggest?",
      "model_response": "The patient's lipid profile shows:\n\n- LDL cholesterol: 64 mg/dl (low/optimal)\n- HDL cholesterol: 156 mg/dl (markedly elevated)\n- Total cholesterol: 240 mg/dl (borderline high)\n- Triglycerides: 99 mg/dl (normal)\n- Total cholesterol to HDL ratio: 1.5 (very low, indicating low cardiovascular risk)\n\nOther labs:\n\n- Blood pH 8.0 (alkaline, but blood pH is normally tightly regulated around 7.35-7.45; this may be a lab artifact or urine pH)\n- Monocytes 7% (normal range)\n- Lymphocytes 880/cmm (low absolute count)\n- Blood pressure 140/85 mmHg (prehypertension)\n- Fasting blood sugar 100 mg/dl (upper limit of normal)\n- Free T4 0.96 ng/dl (normal)\n- Bilirubin 1.7 mg/dl (mildly elevated)\n\nGiven the very high HDL cholesterol (156 mg/dl), which is unusual, and the total cholesterol being elevated mainly due to HDL, the most likely diagnosis is **isolated elevated HDL cholesterol (hyperalphalipoproteinemia)**.\n\nThis condition is often benign and associated with lower cardiovascular risk. The patient’s exercise habits and metabolic parameters support a generally healthy profile.\n\nThe mildly elevated bilirubin could be Gilbert's syndrome or a benign finding.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Most likely diagnosis: **Isolated high HDL cholesterol (hyperalphalipoproteinemia) with borderline high total cholesterol due to elevated HDL.**\n- Cardiovascular risk is low given the lipid profile.\n- No evidence of metabolic syndrome or thyroid dysfunction.\n- Recommend continued healthy lifestyle and monitoring.\n\nIf the patient is asymptomatic and no other risk factors are present, no specific treatment is needed for the elevated HDL.",

Can you please tell me how much possibility is there for a fetal heartbeat and fetaql pole after 10 days. Thanks in advance.",

At 7 weeks by last menstrual period (LMP), the embryo may still be too small to visualize a fetal pole or detect cardiac activity, especially if ovulation occurred later than average or if dating is slightly off. The presence of a gestational sac and yolk sac without a fetal pole is consistent with an early viable pregnancy or a pregnancy too early to confirm viability.\n\nThe doctor's advice to repeat the scan in 10 days aligns with standard practice to confirm viability by detecting a fetal heartbeat by then. The hormonal tablets (Conest, a combination of estrogen and progesterone) are likely being used to support the pregnancy.\n\nIn summary:  \n**Most likely diagnosis:** Early intrauterine pregnancy prior to visualization of fetal pole and heartbeat (too early to confirm viability).",

Shingles is a reactivation, so no incubation period applies, but after exposure, chickenpox develops in about 2 weeks.\n- **Treatment:** Antiviral medications (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) started within 72 hours of rash onset, pain management, and sometimes corticosteroids.\n- **Recurrence:** Possible but uncommon; risk increases with age and immunosuppression.\n\nIn summary, the diagnosis is **Herpes Zoster (Shingles)** caused by reactivation of VZV, influenced by immune status and possibly stress/nutrition, with limited transmission risk, treatable with antivirals, and potential for recurrence.",

They removed my cecum, ileocecal valve , and appendix, luckily I do not have a colostomy they were able to reconnect everything without any problems. I did have a general surgeon who actually specializes in vascular surgery do the procedure because he was on call. I have been experiencing some difficulty sleeping since surgery. I will doze off and wake up feeling nauseated and lightheaded with a weird vibratory sensation throughout my chest. Also when I stand up my vision goes dark for a few seconds. I am eating 4-5 small meals a day and drinking one Gatorade and about 2 bottled water a day. My urine is light yellow and I am going about 5-6 times a day. BM s daily to every other day, no diarrhea. I haven t been taking any pain meds since I left the hospital on the 12 th. I take Zantac and Prevacid once daily. It may just be anxiety from the whole experience but I m just a little concerned. Can you help me understand what might be causing these symptoms?",

There is trivial turbulence in the aortic valves. There is trivial pulmonic and trivial tricuspid insufficiency. The TRP is not raised. Both IAS and IVS look intact.

I am having a sensation of constant/always urination; with a weired kind of burning senation in peline urethera and penile head. This situtation occurs after i did abusive/lengthy masturbation 10 MONTHS ago. After masterbation or having intercource with my wife it used to come for only 2 - 3 hours and after sleep in the morning used to feel alright. But due to a lenghty/abusing masterbation session 10 MONTHS ago feeling of urination have become constant and not going away The following test are done so far. 1. Urine Culture - All Normal. 2. Renal Ultrasound - All Normal (prostate size is normal about 24) 3. CBC - All Nomral. (Dr Says very slight Iron Deficiency Anemia; dr put me on iron tablets for a month) 4. LFT - All Normal. 5. Diabetic - Normal 5. Vitamin D - I am deficient (Dr put me on tablets for a month) 6. Vitamin B - Before the onset of these symptoms i was deficient in vtamin B and had few injections of cynacoblamin were given. All the doctors are clue less as of now; these symptoms are really really killing me everyday. I have seen a few urologists with the following diagnosis and treatment but with no relief. 1. A urologist diagnosed it as non-specific non-inflammatory prostatitis and put me on Cipro for 4 weeks but to no avail after that he put me on levofloxacin for a week with no relief at all. 2. Another urologist marked it as NSU and put me on numbing jell and a tablet which turns your urine dark yellow for 5 days with no avail. I also took a TCA Tofranil (Imipramine) for about 2 weeks for no avail at all. After being exhaused from thease treatments i have also tried alternative treatments as follows. 1. Homeopathic for 2 months with no avail. 2. TCM (Traditional chinese medicines for few months with no avail) As I am running out of ideas may be the following can be considered. 1. parasitic infection. 2. Pudendal nerve entrpement or perinal nerve pinching etc. Dorsal nerve etc. Or any other nerve disorder. 3. IC 4. MS Please help me to get rid of these annoying symptoms. Could you please help me understand what might be causing these symptoms?",

Pudendal nerve entrapment or neurological diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis) would usually have additional neurological signs or symptoms.\n\nTherefore, chronic pelvic pain syndrome (nonbacterial prostatitis) is the most fitting diagnosis.",

I recently was told I have a tumur on my thyroid right size golf ball size which is getting removed in a week or so. I just really concerned about these new bumps now, last year I had a nerve shealth tumor removed of spine that I was told was non cancerous. The FNA I had on the thyroid tumor also suggested non cancerous. I have an ultrasound scheduled for new bumps but I m getting sick to my stomach stressing about it. Can you give me any insight as to what you may believe it is? Thank you, 42 yr old Marine",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **bilateral accessory (supernumerary) trapezius muscle hypertrophy or accessory muscle tissue** at the posterior neck/shoulder region.\n\nRationale:\n- The location at the junction of the collarbone and neck, becoming more prominent with shoulder shrugging, suggests involvement of the trapezius muscle or accessory muscle tissue rather than lymphadenopathy or cysts.\n- The bumps are soft, bilateral, and enlarging but painless, which is typical for muscle hypertrophy or accessory muscle slips.\n- The patient’s history of benign tumors (thyroid and nerve sheath) does not directly explain these new soft tissue masses.\n- Ultrasound will help differentiate muscle tissue from cystic or solid masses.\n\nOther less likely considerations include:\n- Bilateral lipomas (usually not affected by muscle movement)\n- Enlarged lymph nodes (usually firmer and not movement-dependent)\n- Branchial cleft cysts or other congenital cysts (usually unilateral and not movement-dependent)\n\nGiven the clinical features, accessory muscle tissue or muscle hypertrophy is the most plausible diagnosis.",

The unclear biopsy may have missed diagnostic tissue or was non-representative. The worsening lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms strongly suggest a lymphoproliferative malignancy.\n\nOther differential diagnoses (less likely given the presentation):  \n- Tuberculosis or other granulomatous disease (would expect constitutional symptoms and possibly positive biopsy findings)  \n- Autoimmune lymphadenopathy (e.g., lupus)  \n- Other malignancies (e.g., metastatic cancer)  \n- Chronic infections\n\n**Next steps:**  \n- Repeat or excisional lymph node biopsy with immunophenotyping and molecular studies.  \n- Imaging (CT/PET scan) to assess extent of lymphadenopathy.  \n- Hematology/oncology consultation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe most likely diagnosis is **intra-abdominal lymphoma (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma).**",

ALso we shall be grateful  for the correct advice at this stage to safeguard the interest of the patient. Could you please help us understand what her diagnosis means and what condition she has?",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **triple vessel coronary artery disease (CAD)** with significant atherosclerotic stenoses in the left anterior descending (LAD), obtuse marginal (OM1), and right coronary artery (RCA).\n\nRegarding the clinical question:\n\n- The patient had a moderately positive treadmill test (TMT), which is a non-invasive test indicating possible ischemia.\n- Coronary angiography, an invasive test, was performed next and revealed severe multi-vessel disease.\n- The cardiologist recommended a stress thallium test after angiography to assess inducible ischemia.\n\n**Clinical reasoning:**\n\n- Typically, non-invasive stress testing (like TMT or stress thallium) is done first to evaluate ischemia and guide the need for angiography.\n- In this case, the TMT was already positive, which justifies proceeding to coronary angiography to define anatomy and plan revascularization.\n- Performing a stress thallium test after angiography is unusual but may be done to assess the extent of viable myocardium or ischemic burden to guide treatment strategy.\n- Therefore, proceeding directly to angiography after a positive TMT is appropriate and standard practice.\n- The stress thallium test is not mandatory before angiography if the TMT is positive and clinical suspicion is high.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Most likely diagnosis: **Severe triple vessel coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis.**\n- Proceeding directly to coronary angiography after a positive treadmill test was appropriate.\n- Stress thallium testing is not required before angiography but may be used afterward for further ischemia assessment.",

I feel like something get stuck under my ribs - feels like when a baby pushes with his feet against it (not sore, but pressure).... I also get a feeling of movement in my stomach from time to time... again like when you are pregnant... I am not!!!  Had my period a week ago.... and I am 46.

      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **acute viral or post-infectious perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome-like presentation) or a resolving inflammatory process involving the liver capsule (perihepatic inflammation)**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The initial presentation with lower back pain resembling labor, progressing to stabbing right upper quadrant and sub-sternal pain worsened by inspiration, along with right shoulder and neck pain, suggests diaphragmatic or perihepatic irritation.\n- Elevated CRP and D-dimer indicate an inflammatory or thrombotic process initially.\n- Mildly elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin support some hepatic or biliary involvement but no clear obstructive pathology.\n- Imaging ruled out gallstones and pulmonary embolism; the small hepatic hemangioma is incidental.\n- Improvement with antibiotics suggests an inflammatory or infectious etiology.\n- Persistent sensations of pressure and intermittent abdominal movements after symptom resolution may be related to visceral hypersensitivity or residual inflammation.\n- The recent menstrual period and female sex raise the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), which can cause right upper quadrant pain and perihepatic inflammation without clear gallbladder disease.\n\n**Summary:** The clinical picture fits a diagnosis of perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome) or a similar inflammatory process involving the liver capsule, likely post-infectious or viral, causing pleuritic right upper quadrant pain and referred shoulder pain, with mild liver enzyme elevation and systemic inflammation.",

It seem like first 3 times chemo therapy is not working so my doctor change to different chemo medicine, is seem like cancer wont spread and shrunk. by that time i met some one and he recommend me to change my diet, drink more water, no sugar, so when i went to draw blood my CEA went up from 24 to 30 and after i change my diet and last 3 chemo my CEA back down to 13 and my doctor told me i have to do one more chemo. And i decided not to do because a lot of people told me radiation and chemo kill people more than cancer kill people. So i went back to draw blood and check with my doctor my CEA go back up to 26.     I would like to know am i do the right thing? just only change my diet and not listen what my doctor tell me what to do??? right now i feel just like normal person, i can go to exercise, running, walking, but i lot some weight  because i eat only fish, vegetable, and fruit.would you please, answer me what am i suppose to do?? Thank you so muchGary",

Given the timeline—postoperative chest pain treated with nitroglycerin leading to tachycardia and hypertension, followed by persistent severe shaking, nausea, and nerve twitching—the symptoms suggest a **sympathetic overdrive or withdrawal from sedative/anxiolytic medications** (e.g., benzodiazepines) that might have been used perioperatively or during treatment.\n\nAlternatively, the symptoms could represent **serotonin syndrome** or **sympathomimetic toxicity** if other medications (e.g., opioids, antidepressants, or stimulants) were involved.\n\nIn summary, the most likely diagnosis is **benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome** or **sympathetic overactivity due to medication effects or withdrawal**.

About 10 years ago, I began having petit mal seizures, which my doctor said are caused by the scar tissue from my operation and radiation therapy . After trying every anti epileptic medication I am currently on Felbatol and Onfi. In October I experienced a different type of seizure becoming basically numb on 1 side of my body. I went to the hospital: One of the doctors said I may have had a stroke and another said I suffered from Todds paralysis . I went for an MRI and my friend who is a doctor said the results sounded like a stroke they saw a new white spot on my scan. My corrodoted arterty test came back ok and the EKG they did in the hospital was normal. I just went for both tests again. Could you please help me understand what my diagnosis might be?",

They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call. Today the right side of my tongue swelled for no reason. The emergency doctor said it (the tongue swelling) was probably something due to an allergic reaction. I am not allergic to anything!!! They found nothing sent me home saying to talk to my primary. I am 42 years of age female never smoked, been in great health. Now these items are coming up. I am scared these doctors are not finding what is wrong even with my condition. Why would my right side of my tongue swell during this? Could you please help me understand what might be causing the swelling on the right side of my tongue?",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **recurrent or ongoing thromboembolism despite anticoagulation, complicated by possible filter-related issues and angioedema-like tongue swelling**.\n\nExplanation:\n- The patient has a history of DVT with elevated factor VIII, a known thrombophilia increasing clot risk.\n- She has a Greenfield filter, which can trap emboli but does not prevent new clot formation.\n- Subtherapeutic INR despite increased warfarin dose suggests inadequate anticoagulation, increasing risk of recurrent thrombosis or embolism.\n- Chest pressure could represent pulmonary embolism (PE) not detected on imaging due to filter trapping emboli or small emboli below detection threshold.\n- Sudden right-sided tongue swelling resembles angioedema, which can be related to medication (warfarin or other), hereditary angioedema, or thrombotic microangiopathy, but no allergy history or clear cause was found.\n- The combination of recurrent thrombotic risk, inadequate anticoagulation, and filter presence points toward ongoing thromboembolic disease as the primary diagnosis.\n\nIn summary, the most likely diagnosis is **recurrent pulmonary embolism or thromboembolism despite anticoagulation, with possible angioedema or thrombotic complication causing tongue swelling**. Further hematologic and allergy/immunologic evaluation is warranted.",

I did find out after the x-ray and CT scan that I only have one kidney; I never knew that. I have no abdominal or back pain, nor do I have pain during urination, I only know that something came out when I look into the toilet.

Further evaluation with serum tryptase levels, skin biopsy, and possibly bone marrow biopsy is warranted.",

In this case, I think it had to be 20 minutes from the time of the accident to the time the ambulance arrived at the ER. 2. Wasn t termination of further medical assistance really up to the next-of-kin? I m just looking for a simple explanation or non-binding opinion. Any assistance on this matter that you could extend to me would be appreciated. I have to go visit my aunt on Tuesday and I d like to have these answers so that I go with some peace of mind before I see her and make her more upset than she already is. Could you please help me understand what this condition means and what diagnosis might apply?",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **brain death**.\n\nExplanation:\n- Brain death is the irreversible cessation of all brain activity, including the brainstem.\n- Despite brain death, the heart can continue to beat for a variable period if supported by mechanical ventilation and other life-sustaining measures, because the heart has its own intrinsic pacemaker.\n- The decision to discontinue life support after brain death is typically guided by hospital protocols and legal regulations, and usually involves discussions with the patient's next of kin or legal surrogate to obtain consent.",

In the last 6 months i was recently prescribed 30 mg adderall bid and effexor 325mg QD for depression, motivation and attention. While I don t have a real substantial hx of any physical nor mental dx s, my gene pool has several. ADHD , Tourette s, Asperger s, ODD, OCD, Depression, Bi-polar, Anxiety, Anger, IVDA, Polysub, ETOH. There is no schizophrenia , no suicide nor homocidal behavior. I am seeking answers to my behaviors that don t seem to be quite in-step with the general population, because I have always (mostly) brought out the worst in people, make them angry, resentful, assaultive (both physically and mentally), without meaning to at all. I am straight-forward, and am surprised when it s not appreciated and am perceived as mean. Could you please help me understand what diagnosis might explain these behaviors?",

The chest tightness moves around or even goes away sometimes but for the most part it in the base of my lungs or sometimes a bit lower than my rib cage. Right now its directly in the centre of my chest, It also feels like something needs to be cleared from deep in the back of my throat every so often when I breathe in. I do or did smoke. Ive made a conscious effort to stop but its only been a couple of days. Im worried its something very serious. I have suffered from anxiety for over a decade but Im well attuned to that to identify that it isnt the issue here. At least I dont think it is. This has kind of sprung out of nowhere as I was fine a week ago. Im not under any stress. I thought it might be reflux but I dont know. I do suffer from that also but have never experienced anything remotely close to this. Can you help me understand what might be causing these symptoms?",

The surgical gum graft procedure is appropriate to close the defect and prevent food impaction or irritation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nMost likely diagnosis: **Mucosal fenestration or persistent epithelialized tract (not an active sinus tract).**  \nRecommendation: Surgical closure (gum graft) is reasonable; spontaneous closure is unlikely.",

Chest pain and coughing up mucus so went to the doctor who said i had pharyngitis. 2 weeks after and still coughing i developed really sore ribs especially when laughing, coughing, sneezing deep breathing and lying down in bed. Went to the doctor who said it was the intercostal muscles and gave me pain relief and an inhaler due to shortness of breath. 2 weeks later due to not breathing properly i developed a chest infection given anti biotics. After a month of pain relief and still not much relief she wondered whether the pain relief (diclofenac) was causing reflux making the cough worse so prescribed some tablets to go along with it. The night time cough did disappear. Rib pain is still present when deep breathing especially when exercising. A week ago i really overdone it strenously walking and then 3 days ago developed a cough, that is progressivley getting worse. Last night it caused throat pain whilst coughing and a feeling of a lump in my throat and struggling to breathe took my inhaler and it actually relieved it all. Rib pain is now alot worse again and this is 14 weeks since the illness started. I dont understand why the rib pain hasnt gone and why this cough keeps reoccurring. Can you help me understand what might be causing these symptoms?",

      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is a **slow-growing pulmonary malignancy**, such as **bronchogenic carcinoma** (e.g., adenocarcinoma), given the increase in size of the pulmonary nodule from 1.5 cm to 2.6 cm over four years, intermittent fever (which can be a paraneoplastic or infectious symptom), and the nodule's characteristics on imaging.\n\nKey points supporting this diagnosis:\n- Growth of the nodule over time (from 1.5 cm to 2.6 cm) suggests a neoplastic process rather than a benign stable lesion.\n- Initial bronchoscopy was negative, but malignancies can be missed if peripheral or small.\n- Hounsfield units (18 HU) suggest the nodule is solid but not calcified (calcified nodules typically have >100 HU), which is consistent with malignancy or active inflammation.\n- Intermittent fever may indicate tumor-related inflammation or secondary infection.\n\nFurther diagnostic steps would include PET-CT to assess metabolic activity, repeat biopsy or surgical resection for histopathological diagnosis.\n\n**Summary:** The most likely diagnosis is a slow-growing primary lung cancer (bronchogenic carcinoma).",

Additionally, she seems to be having symptoms similar to a urinary tract infection - burning and constant feeling to urinate. Is that a symptom involved with gall stones or the removal thereof? And to add more to all of it, she has been having diaherra for over 2 months. Her doctor precribed her medications for this which help when she remembers to take them, but it seems to be an ongoing issue for her - even more so after the surgery. I m worried that my grandmother may have some other issues going on that the doctors haven t found yet. Can you help shed some light on any of this? Thank you!",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **post-cholecystectomy syndrome with underlying irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or another chronic gastrointestinal condition**.\n\nExplanation:\n- Persistent severe pain one week after gallstone surgery may indicate post-cholecystectomy syndrome, which can cause ongoing abdominal pain and digestive symptoms.\n- The chronic diarrhea predating surgery suggests a pre-existing gastrointestinal disorder such as IBS or microscopic colitis, which can worsen after surgery or stress.\n- Dysuria and urinary urgency are unlikely to be directly related to gallstones or their removal; they may indicate a concurrent urinary tract infection or interstitial cystitis.\n- The combination of symptoms suggests two separate issues: post-surgical abdominal pain and a chronic GI condition causing diarrhea, with a possible urinary tract problem causing urinary symptoms.\n\nFurther evaluation with abdominal imaging, stool studies, and urine analysis is recommended to clarify these diagnoses.",

      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **ischemic colitis**.\n\nReasoning:\n- Sudden onset of severe abdominal cramps and sweating, with near syncope, suggests acute abdominal pathology.\n- Passage of bloody stools with fresh red blood and clots indicates colonic mucosal injury or bleeding.\n- Normal blood tests do not exclude ischemia.\n- The patient's recent history of pain in the ankle and calf suggests possible peripheral vascular disease or embolic phenomena.\n- Fasting and possible dehydration can predispose to mesenteric ischemia.\n- Relief of cramps with antispasmodics (bioscope tablets) is common but does not rule out ischemia.\n- The timing (early morning) and symptoms fit with ischemic colitis, which often presents with sudden abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.\n\nOther differentials like infectious colitis or inflammatory bowel disease are less likely given the acute presentation and systemic symptoms.\n\n**Summary:** Acute ischemic colitis secondary to mesenteric hypoperfusion or embolism is the most likely diagnosis.",

Today, she was seen by a 4th Pediatrician and he tested her for bacteria that may be the cause of a fissure. He also said she has a yeast infection around the vaginal and anal area. He prescribed Diflucan 100 MG (2 tablets). She will see him again next week when the test results come back.

It is less likely to be heart-related, as cardiac pain typically presents differently (e.g., pressure-like, not burning, and not worsened by breathing).

I dont have anymore mucus its just feel like i have a lump in my throat which causes me to have short of breath. Is this normal?",
      "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is **laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)** or **postnasal drip with laryngeal irritation**.\n\nExplanation:\n- The initial cough triggered by smoking suggests airway irritation.\n- Fluid in the lungs diagnosed by the physician may have been misinterpreted or related to an infection treated with antibiotics.\n- After quitting smoking and resolution of mucus production, the persistent sensation of a lump in the throat (globus sensation) and shortness of breath points toward laryngeal irritation or reflux rather than active infection.\n- LPR commonly causes throat discomfort, globus sensation, and can cause cough and breathing difficulty without mucus production.\n\nOther considerations like asthma or vocal cord dysfunction could cause shortness of breath but the lump sensation is more typical of LPR or throat irritation.\n\nIf symptoms persist, further evaluation with laryngoscopy and pulmonary function tests may be warranted.",

I have fed him toast today but isn t interested really in eating but its hard trying to get fluids into him so tried him with soup tonight, he ate it then immediately afterwards threw up he has done this the past 3 nights. Is there anything I can give him which will help him get over this??? Or what foods are good for him to try keep his strength up??

I was advised to remain sexually active or you can say not to put a big gap i.e. 10-15 days, if it happens i have been advised masturbation.
