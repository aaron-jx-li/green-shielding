right axillary lymph nodes for 2 weeks.\n- No resolution of symptoms despite treatment.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Costochondritis typically causes localized chest wall pain worsened by movement and palpation, but it does **not** cause lymphadenopathy.\n- Persistent chest pain unresponsive to standard treatment and associated with regional lymphadenopathy suggests an alternative diagnosis.\n- Recurrent bronchitis and axillary lymphadenopathy raise suspicion for an infectious or inflammatory process.\n- Differential diagnoses to consider:\n  - Infectious causes: bacterial or viral infections causing lymphadenitis.\n  - Tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial infection (especially with persistent lymphadenopathy).\n  - Neoplastic causes (lymphoma or metastatic disease) are less likely but should be considered if symptoms persist.\n  - Musculoskeletal causes alone do not explain lymphadenopathy.\n\nMost likely diagnosis:\n- Given the history of recurrent bronchitis, persistent chest pain, and ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, **infectious lymphadenitis secondary to an unresolved or atypical infection (e.g., atypical mycobacterial infection or tuberculosis) is the most likely diagnosis**.\n- The chest pain may be related to inflammation or infection involving the chest wall or pleura rather than simple costochondritis.\n\nRecommendation:\n- Further evaluation with imaging (chest X-ray or CT scan) to assess lung parenchyma and lymph nodes.\n- Laboratory tests including CBC, inflammatory markers, and possibly lymph node biopsy or aspiration if lymphadenopathy persists.\n- Consider infectious workup including TB testing.\n\n**Summary:** The most likely diagnosis is infectious lymphadenitis (possibly atypical mycobacterial or tuberculosis) causing axillary

tremor)\n- Unstable eye movements with upward gaze fixation and forehead involvement (suggestive of oculogyric crisis or abnormal eye movement)\n- Normal brain and spine MRI\n- Normal EEG\n\n---\n\n**Differential considerations:**\n\n1. **Acute cerebellar ataxia/post-infectious cerebellitis:**  \n   - Usually follows viral illness, presents with ataxia and imbalance.  \n   - Typically no progressive deterioration to inability to stand within weeks.  \n   - MRI often normal early on.\n\n2. **Neurodegenerative/metabolic disorders:**  \n   - Usually have a more chronic course, not subacute progressive over weeks.  \n   - MRI may show abnormalities.\n\n3. **Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS):**  \n   - Characterized by chaotic eye movements (opsoclonus), myoclonus, ataxia.  \n   - Often paraneoplastic (neuroblastoma in infants).  \n   - Eye movements are chaotic multidirectional saccades, not just upward gaze fixation.  \n   - MRI usually normal.\n\n4. **Paroxysmal tonic upgaze (PTU) of infancy:**  \n   - Characterized by sustained upward gaze with head and forehead involvement.  \n   - Usually benign and non-progressive.\n\n5. **Progressive encephalopathy with eye movement abnormalities:**  \n   - Could be metabolic or genetic but usually not so rapid.\n\n6. **Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE):**  \n   - Occurs in older children, EEG abnormal.\n\n7. **Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis or other autoimmune encephalitis:**  \n   - Can cause movement disorders, eye movement abnormalities, but usually with altered consciousness or seizures.\n\n---\n\n**Most likely diagnosis:**\n\nThe combination of **subacute progressive motor deterioration, new onset shaking (myoclonus), and characteristic upward gaze fixation with forehead involvement**, with normal MRI and EEG, in a previously normal infant, strongly suggests **Paroxysmal Tonic Upgaze (PTU) of infancy** with worsening symptoms or a related movement disorder.\n\nHowever, PTU is usually non-progressive and benign.\n\nGiven the rapid progression and motor regression, a more concerning diagnosis is:\n\n**Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome (OMS)**\n\n- OMS presents with ataxia, myoclonus (shaking), and abnormal eye movements (opsoclonus).  \n- Eye movements can include upward gaze fixation and involvement of forehead muscles due to abnormal eye-head coordination.  \n- MRI and EEG are often normal.  \n- It is often paraneoplastic (neuroblastoma), so screening for tumor is essential.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The clinical picture fits **Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome (OMS)** best.  \n- Normal MRI and EEG do not exclude OMS.  \n- Urgent evaluation for neuroblastoma and immunotherapy is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Screen for neuroblastoma (abdominal ultrasound, urine catecholamines).  \n- Consider CSF studies and autoimmune antibody panels.  \n- Early immunotherapy (steroids, IVIG) may improve

Given the clinical picture and beta hCG trend, ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out urgently.\n\n**Recommended next steps:**  \n- Close monitoring of beta hCG every 48 hours to assess doubling or decline.  \n- Repeat ultrasound in 1 week or sooner if symptoms worsen.  \n- Clinical evaluation for signs of ectopic rupture (severe pain, hemodynamic instability).  \n- Consider referral to gynecology for further management.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Most likely diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy or early nonviable pregnancy (miscarriage).**", "reference_diagnosis": "Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL); possible early intrauterine pregnancy, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy", "judge_dx_space": {"plausible_set": ["Pregnancy of unknown location", "Ectopic pregnancy", "Early intrauterine pregnancy (too early to visualize)", "Early pregnancy loss (miscarriage)", "Gestational trophoblastic disease"], "highly_likely_set": ["Pregnancy of unknown location", "Ectopic pregnancy", "Early intrauterine pregnancy (too early to visualize)"]}, "metrics": {"plausibility": 1.0, "h_coverage": 0.3333333333333333, "h_precision": 0.3333333333333333, "extracted_diagnoses": ["ectopic pregnancy", "early nonviable pregnancy", "miscarriage"], "in_P": [{"dx": "ectopic pregnancy", "matched_P": "Ectopic pregnancy", "match_info": {"match": true, "relation": "same", "note": "string_match"}}, {"dx": "early nonviable pregnancy", "matched_P": "Early pregnancy loss (miscarriage)", "match_info": {"match": true, "relation": "same", "note": "batch_bool"}}, {"dx": "miscarriage", "matched_P": "Early pregnancy loss (miscarriage)", "match_info": {"match": true, "relation": "same", "note": "string_match"}}], "out_of_P": [], "covered_H": [{"h": "Ectopic pregnancy", "matched_dx": "ectopic pregnancy", "match_info": {"match": true, "relation": "same", "note": "string_match"}}], "uncovered_H": ["Pregnancy of unknown location", "Early intrauterine pregnancy (too early to visualize)"], "in_H": [{"dx": "ectopic pregnancy", "matched_H": "Ectopic pregnancy", "match_info": {"match": true, "relation": "same", "note": "string_match"}}], "out_of_H": ["early nonviable pregnancy", "miscarriage"], "uncertainty_flag": true, "breadth": 3, "normalized_breadth": 0.6, "support_rate": 1.0, "hallucinated_evidence_rate": 0.0, "grounding_per_diagnosis": [{"diagnosis": "ectopic pregnancy", "input_support_quotes": ["Initial serum beta hCG was low (7 mIU/mL), then rose slowly over 3 weeks to 204 mIU/mL", "Cramping and bright red bleeding shortly after initial test", "Ultrasound shows no gestational sac or intrauterine pregnancy", "Given the bleeding and cramping, and the failure to visualize an intrauterine pregnancy at a beta hCG >200, ectopic pregnancy is a critical diagnosis to exclude"], "has_support": true, "hallucinated_evidence_claims": [], "has_hallucinated_evidence": false}, {"diagnosis": "early nonviable pregnancy", "input_support_quotes": ["Initial serum beta hCG was low (7 mIU/mL), then rose slowly over 3 weeks to 204 mIU/mL", "Ultrasound shows no gestational sac or intrauterine pregnancy", "They said maybe i miscarried three Tuesdays ago at the ed or maybe im early in pregnancy and couldnt see it being my levels were so low"], "has_support": true, "hallucinated_evidence_claims": [], "has_hallucinated_evidence": false}, {"diagnosis": "miscarriage", "input_support_quotes": ["Monday night I started cramping and bleeding bright red blood", "went to ED on Tuesday Sept 14th to be positive that I was miscarring bc I had positive test and negative ChatDoctor serum", "They said maybe i miscarried three Tuesdays ago at the ed"], "has_support": true, "hallucinated_evidence_claims": [], "has_hallucinated_evidence": false}]}}, {"index": 2247, "has_pxhx": true, "input": "I have shortness of breath esp when active.

Recurrent swollen lymph nodes with unclear biopsy results could reflect sampling error or early lymphoma.  \n   - Night symptoms, fatigue, and abdominal pain are common.  \n   - Weight gain is unusual but may reflect metabolic changes or steroid use if previously treated.\n\n2. **Chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis, HIV, other granulomatous diseases):**  \n   - Can cause persistent lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.  \n   - Usually accompanied by weight loss rather than gain.\n\n3. **Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (e.g., sarcoidosis, lupus):**  \n   - Can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms but less commonly isolated abdominal lymphadenopathy.\n\n4. **Endocrine/metabolic disorders:**  \n   - Unexplained obesity with inability to lose weight despite minimal intake suggests possible hypothalamic or endocrine dysfunction (e.g., Cushing\u2019s syndrome), which can also cause lymphadenopathy secondarily.\n\nGiven the prominence of abdominal lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, and unclear prior biopsy, **the most likely diagnosis is an abdominal lymphoma (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma)** that was missed or inadequately sampled previously.\n\n**Recommended next steps:**  \n- Repeat and more targeted lymph node biopsy (preferably excisional or image-guided core biopsy of abdominal nodes).  \n- Comprehensive imaging (CT or PET-CT) to assess lymphadenopathy extent.  \n- Laboratory workup including CBC, LDH, inflammatory markers, viral serologies, and endocrine evaluation.  \n- Close follow-up with hematology/oncology and the planned colon specialist.\n\n**Summary:**  \nMost likely diagnosis is **abdominal lymphoma** causing recurrent lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.", "reference_diagnosis": "Lymphadenopathy, possible tubercular etiology", "judge_dx_space": {"plausible_set": ["Lymphoma", "Inflammatory bowel disease", "Mesenteric lymphadenitis", "Chronic intra-abdominal infection", "Metastatic cancer", "Celiac disease", "Endometriosis", "Ovarian pathology"], "highly_likely_set": ["Lymphoma", "Inflammatory bowel disease", "Mesenteric lymphadenitis"]}, "metrics": {"plausibility": 0.4, "h_coverage": 0.3333333333333333, "h_precision": 0.2, "extracted_diagnoses": ["abdominal lymphoma", "chronic infections", "sarcoidosis", "lupus", "Cushing\u2019s syndrome"], "in_P": [{"dx": "abdominal lymphoma", "matched_P": "Lymphoma", "match_info": {"match": true, "relation": "same", "note": "string_match"}}, {"dx": "chronic infections", "matched_P": "Chronic intra-abdominal infection", "match_info": {"match": true, "relation": "same", "note": "batch_bool"}}], "out_of_P": ["sarcoidosis", "lupus", "Cushing\u2019s syndrome"], "covered_H": [{"h": "Lymphoma", "matched_dx": "abdominal lymphoma", "match_info": {"match": true, "relation": "same", "note": "string_match"}}], "uncovered_H": ["Inflammatory bowel disease", "Mesenteric lymphadenitis"], "in_H": [{"dx": "abdominal lymphoma", "matched_H": "Lymphoma", "match_info": {"match": true, "relation": "same", "note": "string_match"}}], "out_of_H": ["chronic infections", "sarcoidosis", "lupus", "Cushing\u2019s syndrome"], "uncertainty_flag": false, "breadth": 5, "normalized_breadth": 0.625, "support_rate": 1.0, "hallucinated_evidence_rate": 0.4, "grounding_per_diagnosis": [{"diagnosis": "abdominal lymphoma", "input_support_quotes": ["I have swollen Lymph nodes, I have had this for the second time.", "My nodes started swelling last night making it unbearable to sleep. worse ones are in abdomine.", "pain in lower abdomine that travels any time any where, worse at night", "extream fatigue", "Hot spells especially at night, not assoiated with hot flashes"], "has_support": true, "hallucinated_evidence_claims": ["Weight gain is unusual but may reflect metabolic changes or steroid use if previously treated.", "the most likely diagnosis is an abdominal lymphoma (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma) that was missed or inadequately sampled previously."], "has_hallucinated_evidence": true}, {"diagnosis": "chronic infections", "input_support_quotes": ["I have swollen Lymph nodes, I have had this for the second time.", "extream fatigue", "pain in lower abdomine that travels any time any where, worse at night", "Nausious all the time especially after eating"], "has_support": true, "hallucinated_evidence_claims": [], "has_hallucinated_evidence": false}, {"diagnosis": "sarcoidosis", "input_support_quotes": ["I have swollen Lymph nodes, I have had this for the second time.", "extream fatigue", "pain in lower abdomine that travels any time any where, worse at night"], "has_support": true, "hallucinated_evidence_claims": [], "has_hallucinated_evidence": false}, {"diagnosis": "lupus", "input_support_quotes": ["I have swollen Lymph nodes, I have had this for the second time.", "extream fatigue", "pain in lower abdomine that travels any time any where, worse at night"], "has_support": true, "hallucinated_evidence_claims": [], "has_hallucinated_evidence": false}, {"diagnosis": "Cushing\u2019s syndrome", "input_support_quotes": ["over weight and can t loose weight even though I eat almost nothing."], "has_support": true, "hallucinated_evidence_claims": ["Unexplained obesity with inability to lose weight despite minimal intake suggests possible hypothalamic or endocrine dysfunction (e.g., Cushing\u2019s syndrome), which can also cause lymphadenopathy secondarily."], "has_hallucinated_evidence": true}]}}, {"index": 1922, "has_pxhx": true, "input": "I got root canal done in 2 sittings.

These suggest impaired motility or functional obstruction in the lower GI tract.  \n   - The ICV is controlled by autonomic nerves, primarily from the lumbar and sacral spinal segments.\n\n2. **Gallbladder bile release concerns:**  \n   - Gallbladder emptying is regulated by the vagus nerve and hormonal signals (e.g., cholecystokinin).  \n   - Dysfunction here suggests possible autonomic or hormonal dysregulation.\n\n3. **Possible causes considered:**  \n   - **Herniated lumbar disk at L4-L5:**  \n     - This can cause nerve root compression affecting lower limb sensation and motor function.  \n     - The autonomic nerves controlling colon motility and ICV are mainly from lower lumbar and sacral segments (L1-S3), but L4-L5 involvement could potentially affect some autonomic fibers.  \n     - However, direct impact on gallbladder function is unlikely since it is innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), not lumbar nerves.  \n   - **Enlarged prostate:**  \n     - Can cause urinary symptoms and possibly pelvic floor dysfunction.  \n     -

An extra calyx alone rarely causes symptoms unless it is associated with complications such as obstruction, infection, or stones.

Also, proteinuria (if present) would suggest glomerular or tubular pathology rather than an anatomical variant.\n\n**Most likely diagnosis:**  \nGiven the persistent back pain with mild degenerative changes and no significant findings on MRI, the pain may be musculoskeletal or related to other causes such as myofascial pain or referred pain.

evaluation including urinalysis, renal function tests, and possibly renal ultrasound or CT urography would be warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Extra renal calyx is an incidental anatomical variant,

discomfort, and respiratory symptoms.\n- LPR often does not respond fully to standard GERD treatment and may require different management.\n- Normal pulmonary and cardiac tests exclude primary lung or heart disease.\n- Anxiety/depression can coexist but do not fully explain the physical symptom progression.\n- Persistent chest pain with normal cardiac workup and GERD history points to reflux-related esophageal or laryngopharyngeal irritation.\n\nRecommendation:\n- Consider ENT evaluation with laryngoscopy to assess for LPR.\n- Trial of lifestyle modifications and possibly different reflux management (e.g., alginates, dietary changes).\n- Evaluate and manage any anxiety/depression as adjunct.\n\nIf symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation for esophageal motility disorders
