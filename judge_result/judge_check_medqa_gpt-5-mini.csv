89,a,"A 27-year-old man is brought into the emergency department by ambulance. The patient was at an appointment to receive welfare when he began acting abnormally. The patient was denied welfare. Shortly afterwards, he no longer responded to questions and stared blankly off into space, not responding to verbal stimuli. Other than odd lip-smacking behavior, he was motionless. Several minutes later, he became responsive but seemed confused. The patient has a past medical history of drug abuse and homelessness and is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 124/78 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with 5/5 strength in the upper and lower extremities and a stable gait. The patient seems confused when answering questions and has trouble remembering the episode. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Complex partial seizure,"Most likely diagnosis: a focal seizure with impaired awareness (complex partial seizure), likely arising from the temporal lobe.

Reasoning: sudden unresponsiveness with staring and automatisms (lip‑smacking), followed minutes later by confusion and amnesia for the event (postictal state) are classic for a complex partial seizure. The episode’s duration (minutes) and automatisms distinguish it from brief absence seizures and from malingering (which is voluntary and would not produce automatisms or a postictal period).",True,True,True

Reasoning: the episode featured impaired responsiveness and a blank stare with automatisms (lip‑smacking), lasted minutes, and was followed by confusion and amnesia for the event — a classic pattern for a focal seizure with impaired awareness. This differs from absence seizures (very brief, no postictal confusion), syncope (usually loss of tone and brief unconsciousness without automatisms), and psychogenic non‑epileptic events (typically longer, variable movements, and different post‑event recovery).

Why: the sudden ""curtain"" of vision loss, new flashes and black spots (floaters), acute peripheral visual-field defects, painless presentation, and the recent cataract surgery (a risk factor for posterior vitreous detachment and subsequent retinal tear/detachment) are classic for retinal detachment. Anterior-segment exam is normal (localizes the problem posteriorly).

Reasoning: The patient has SBO signs (crampy pain, distension, bilious vomiting) plus prior biliary colic. CT in this scenario typically shows the Rigler triad (small‑bowel obstruction, ectopic gallstone, pneumobilia) caused by chronic cholelithiasis with formation of a cholecystoenteric fistula that allows a large stone to impact (usually at the ileocecal valve). This fits better than simple adhesions given the biliary history and imaging.",True,False,False

473,a,"A 25-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after being involved in a rear-end collision, in which she was the restrained driver of the back car. On arrival, she is alert and active. She reports pain in both knees and severe pain over the right groin. Temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 116/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 132/79 mm Hg. Physical examination shows tenderness over both knee caps. The right groin is tender to palpation. The right leg is slightly shortened, flexed, adducted, and internally rotated. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Posterior hip dislocation,"Most likely diagnosis: Posterior dislocation of the right hip.

Reasoning: The classic dashboard mechanism (knee impact in a restrained driver) produces posterior hip dislocation. The affected limb is typically shortened, flexed, adducted, and internally rotated — exactly the described position. A femoral shaft fracture would more often produce deformity and not the characteristic flexed/adducted/internal rotation posture; femoral neck fractures classically cause external rotation.

Reasoning: The patient has foul-smelling otorrhea, a history of recurrent ear infections, conductive hearing loss, and an otoscopic appearance consistent with a retraction pocket/pearly keratinous mass — classic for cholesteatoma. Cholesteatomas are keratinizing squamous epithelial growths that cause local bone erosion (including the facial canal), producing acute peripheral facial palsy.

Why: The history of recurrent childhood ear infections and a month of foul, chronic otorrhea plus conductive hearing loss and the characteristic otoscopic finding (pearly/keratinous mass or retraction pocket) point to cholesteatoma. Cholesteatomas expand and chronically inflame the middle ear/mastoid, causing bone erosion — the facial nerve runs through the temporal bone/middle ear and can be exposed or destroyed, producing facial droop. Other possibilities are less consistent: idiopathic Bell palsy would not have chronic otorrhea or conductive hearing loss; Ramsay Hunt (herpes zoster oticus) produces vesicles and often sensorineural hearing loss; a glomus tumor gives a vascular mass and pulsatile tinnitus rather than foul discharge.",True,True,True

Reasoning: Chronic foul otorrhea and history of recurrent middle‑ear disease with otoscopic evidence of a retraction pocket/pearly keratin mass and conductive hearing loss classically indicate a cholesteatoma. These lesions expand and erode ossicles (causing conductive loss) and surrounding bone, and can erode the facial nerve canal producing an LMN facial palsy that affects the entire hemiface (inability to close the eye and asymmetric smile).

Reasoning: With penetrating trauma, persistent profound hypotension despite adequate volume resuscitation and no ongoing external bleeding strongly suggests an obstructive cause — classically pericardial tamponade from a penetrating cardiac injury. The very low ScvO2 (39%) with a normal SaO2 indicates markedly reduced cardiac output with increased tissue O2 extraction (seen in cardiogenic/obstructive shock), and the cold extremities reflect poor perfusion. Other possibilities (massive PE, distributive/septic shock, ongoing hemorrhage) are less consistent: PE would more typically cause hypoxemia, tachycardia and acute RV failure; distributive shock gives warm extremities and elevated ScvO2; ongoing hemorrhage should have responded to the massive transfusion if there is truly no active bleeding.",True,True,True

Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Examination shows jugular venous distension and bilateral ankle edema. There are erythematous, ring-shaped macules and patches over his trunk that are well-demarcated. Auscultation of the chest shows crackles at the lung bases bilaterally. An S3 is heard on cardiac auscultation. His hemoglobin concentration is 12.2 g/dL, leukocyte count is 13,600/mm3, and platelet count is 280,000/mm3. A urinalysis is normal.

Reasoning: A painless, fluctuant, lateral neck mass anterior to the sternocleidomastoid near the angle/base of the mandible in an adolescent is classic for a branchial cleft cyst (second cleft is the common type). Imaging shows a simple, uniformly hypoechoic/cystic lesion without septations, which fits a congenital epithelial cyst. Other possibilities are less likely: thyroglossal duct cyst is midline and moves with swallowing/tongue protrusion; a laryngocele or venous malformation would enlarge with Valsalva; lymphatic malformation (cystic hygroma) usually presents earlier in life and often has multiloculated septations; solid lymph node/lymphoma would appear more solid/vascular on ultrasound.",True,True,True

The carotid ""double"" or spike-and-dome pulse (bisferiens) is also characteristic of HOCM and helps distinguish it from aortic stenosis, which gives a delayed, weak (parvus et tardus) single upstroke and a murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border.",True,True,True

Reasoning: a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border that increases with Valsalva (or forceful expiration against a closed airway) and a bifid/“two closely spaced” carotid upstroke (pulsus bisferiens) are classic for dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction from HOCM. The history of exertional dyspnea and syncope in a 39‑year‑old also fits.

474,default,"A 65-year-old woman was referred to a specialist for dysphagia and weight loss. She has a history of difficulty swallowing solid foods, which has become worse over the past year. She has unintentionally lost 2.3 kg (5 lb). A previous gastroscopy showed mild gastritis with a positive culture for Helicobacter pylori. A course of triple antibiotic therapy and omeprazole was prescribed. Follow-up endoscopy appeared normal with no H. pylori noted on biopsy. Her heartburn improved but the dysphagia persisted. She had a myocardial infarction four years ago, complicated by acute mitral regurgitation. Physical examination revealed a thin woman with normal vital signs. Auscultation of the heart reveals a 3/6 blowing systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. Breath sounds are reduced at the base of the right lung. The abdomen is mildly distended but not tender. The liver and spleen are not enlarged. Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with a non-specific intraventricular block.

Reasoning: The acute dysarthria with a mild contralateral clumsy/weak hand (impaired skilled movements, mild weakness) and a central facial weakness with preserved forehead wrinkling fits the classic lacunar DCHS picture. Extraocular movements, gait, sensation and higher cortical function are preserved, and CT can be normal early — all typical for a small deep infarct in a patient with HTN/diabetes.

Medications include lisinopril, aspirin, atorvastatin, warfarin, and insulin. Physical examination demonstrates left-sided facial droop and decreased pinprick sensation at the right arm and leg. What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s symptoms?",Thrombotic stroke at the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA),"An acute lateral pontine (left-sided) ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). AICA infarcts produce vestibular symptoms (vertigo, vomiting), ipsilateral facial paralysis (facial nucleus involvement), and contralateral body loss of pain/temp — matching this presentation.

278,a,"A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of lower abdominal pain for 4 hours. She has had vaginal spotting for 2 days. Menses occur at irregular 20- to 45-day intervals and last for 3 to 7 days. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago. She was treated for pelvic inflammatory disease at the age of 20 years with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses condoms inconsistently. Her pulse is 118/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 118/66 mm Hg. Examination shows lower abdominal tenderness. Pelvic examination shows a closed cervix and a uterus of normal size with right adnexal tenderness. Her serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration is 16,000 mIU/mL (N < 5).

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Interstitial pregnancy,"Most likely diagnosis: interstitial (cornual) ectopic pregnancy.

Reasoning: The mass is at the tubouterine junction with a very thin myometrial mantle (3 mm) surrounding it, consistent with an intramural/interstitial implantation. Clinical picture (abdominal pain, vaginal spotting, closed cervix) and an elevated but not markedly massive β-hCG support ectopic pregnancy.

Epigastric pain that is relieved by food and worse at night, positive stool occult blood, smoking, and the acute presentation are classic for duodenal peptic ulcer disease; inflammation or chronic scarring at the pylorus/duodenal bulb narrows the outlet and produces the vomiting, dehydration, hypokalemia and elevated BUN.

What etiologies should be considered in this patient?",Sickle cell disease (SCD),"Conclusion: This is ischemic (low‑flow) priapism most likely due to sickle cell–related vaso‑occlusion (not TTP).

Reasoning (brief):
- Cavernous blood gas (low pO2, high pCO2, acidemia, low O2 sat) is diagnostic of ischemic priapism.
- Howell–Jolly bodies on peripheral smear indicate functional asplenia from repeated splenic infarction — classically seen with sickle cell disease → strongly suggests sickling as the etiology.
- The patient’s age and African‑American background also increase likelihood of sickle cell disease as the cause.

Other etiologies to consider (less likely here but worth excluding):
- Other hematologic disorders: leukemia, thalassemia, other hemoglobinopathies.
- Medications (eg, trazodone, antipsychotics, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, intracavernosal agents).
- Trauma or pelvic/spinal cord injury.
- Hypercoagulable states or malignancy‑related venous occlusion.
- Idiopathic.

Next steps: obtain hemoglobin electrophoresis (or review prior diagnosis), CBC/reticulocyte count, and treat promptly (aspiration, irrigation, intracavernosal phenylephrine; for sickle‑cell–related episodes consider IV fluids, oxygen, analgesia and hematology consult for possible exchange transfusion).",True,False,False

Reasoning: His prehospital hypotension (BP 70/50) fits ischemic injury to susceptible tubular segments (proximal tubule and thick ascending limb), producing epithelial necrosis, sloughing and tubular obstruction — oliguria with muddy-brown granular casts and an elevated FeNa (>2%). Recovery after supportive care is typical as tubular epithelium regenerates.

Blockage at G6Pase leads to accumulation of G6P → increased glycolysis → lactate, increased lipogenesis → hyperlipidemia, and enlarged glycogen-filled liver. Debranching‑enzyme (Cori) disease typically causes milder hypoglycemia with normal lactate, and glucose‑6‑phosphate dehydrogenase is an erythrocyte enzyme causing hemolysis, not this presentation.",True,True,True

Reasoning: Severe fasting hypoglycemia with seizures, marked lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly, and hypertriglyceridemia in an infant is classic for inability to convert glucose‑6‑phosphate to free glucose in liver/kidney. G6P accumulates and is shunted to glycolysis (raising lactate) and lipogenesis (raising triglycerides).

Reasoning: The history of recent chest pain now pain-free plus the characteristic precordial T-wave abnormalities (biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in V2–V3) fits Wellens’ pattern — a marker of critical proximal LAD ischemia.

PaCO2: 80 mmHg
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L

What is the most likely etiology of this patient's presentation?",Heroin overdose,"Correct — acute heroin (opioid) overdose causing respiratory depression.

185,a,"A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with her boyfriend 2 hours after an episode of loss of consciousness. She was seated and was being tattooed on her right upper flank when she became diaphoretic, pale, and passed out. According to her boyfriend, the patient slipped to the floor and her arms and legs moved in a jerky fashion for a few seconds. She regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately. She has no history of serious illness. She works as an event manager and has had more stress than usual due to a recent concert tour. She appears well. Her temperature is 37°C (98.4°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. Her cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Vasovagal syncope,"Most likely diagnosis: vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope with brief convulsive movements.

Reasoning: The event was precipitated by pain/emotion (tattoo), had prodromal diaphoresis/pallor, brief loss of consciousness with rapid recovery (<30s) and no postictal confusion or focal deficits. Brief myoclonic jerks can occur with syncope; features argue against a primary generalized tonic–clonic seizure (longer LOC, postictal state, tongue biting/incontinence more common).",True,True,True
