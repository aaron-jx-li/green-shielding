His mother says that he has never been diagnosed with any medical conditions but has been having “fainting spells” over the past month. Routine lab work reveals a glucose level of 25 mg/dL. The patient is promptly given glucagon and intravenous dextrose and admitted to the hospital for observation. The patient’s mother stays with him during his hospitalization. The patient is successfully watched overnight and his blood glucose levels normalize on his morning levels. The care team discusses a possible discharge during morning rounds. One hour later the nurse is called in for a repeat fainting episode. A c-peptide level is drawn and shown to be low. The patient appears ill, diaphoretic, and is barely arousable. What is the most likely diagnosis in this child?",Munchausen syndrome by proxy,"Most likely: factitious disorder imposed on another (Munchausen syndrome by proxy) — the child is being given exogenous insulin by the caregiver. 

Rationale: profound hypoglycemia with a low C‑peptide indicates exogenous insulin rather than endogenous hyperinsulinism.
