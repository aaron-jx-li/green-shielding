Reasoning: brief, severe position-triggered vertigo with transient nystagmus and vomiting that resolves within a minute and no focal neurologic deficits is classic for BPPV; vestibular neuritis causes prolonged vertigo and a cerebellar stroke/hemorrhage would usually produce persistent deficits, focal signs or prolonged symptoms despite her atrial fibrillation/anticoagulation.",False,True,False
532,default,"A 70-year-old male presents to the emergency department with fever and productive cough that has progressed rapidly over the past day. On exam, he is very ill appearing and his vitals demonstrate T: 39 deg C, HR: 95 bpm, BP: 80/40 mmHg, RR: 15, SaO2: 93%. A CBC is obtained which demonstrates a white blood cell count (WBC) of 14,000. A chest radiograph is obtained which is demonstrated in Figure A. The patient is subsequently diagnosed with severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia and is transferred to the ICU after intubation, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and resuscitation measures are initiated. The patient improves steadily over the subsequent days in the ICU with improving vitals and decreasing WBC. However, on hospital day 4 he develops a fever to 41 deg C, and his WBC elevates to 16,000. On exam, he appears to withdraw in pain when his abdomen is palpated. Liver function tests and amylase/lipase are ordered and shown to be within normal limits.

He spends most of his day thinking about her and this often distracts him from his daily activities. He also admits to hearing his daughter’s voice in his sleep and sometimes has dreams about her. During the day, he sometimes gets brief glimpses of her. He believes this is because he was not able to do anything to help her during the last moments of her life. Other than this, he is able to get along his daily life and has never contemplated suicide. But he often wishes he could be close to his daughter again. What best describes the symptoms this patient is expressing?",Normal grief reaction,"This is most consistent with a normal bereavement (acute grief) reaction. His preoccupation, dreams, transient sense/visuoauditory glimpses of the deceased and guilt are common in normal grief; duration (5 months), preserved functioning and absence of pervasive suicidal ideation argue against major depressive disorder or a persistent/prolonged grief disorder.",False,True,False

Elevated lipase and the flank/periumbilical ecchymosis on exam indicate hemorrhagic pancreatitis.,False,False,True
657,default,"A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fever, chills, and altered mental status for 3 days. According to his daughter, he has had a productive cough during this period. He has type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral neuropathic pain, and a history of deep vein thromboses. Current medications include insulin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, warfarin, and carbamazepine. He is oriented only to self. His temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 86/50 mm Hg. Physical examination shows ecchymoses on both lower extremities. Crackles are heard at the right lung base. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL
Leukocyte count 18,000/mm3
Platelet count 45,000/mm3
Prothrombin time 45 sec
Partial thromboplastin time 75 sec
Serum
Na+ 135 mEq/L
K+ 5.4 mEq/L
Cl- 98 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen 46 mg/dL
Glucose 222 mg/dL
Creatinine 3.3 mg/dL
What is the most likely cause of this patient's ecchymoses?""",Disseminated intravascular coagulation,"Disseminated intravascular coagulation from severe sepsis — endotoxin/tissue-factor–mediated widespread coagulation with consumption of platelets and clotting factors (hence thrombocytopenia and prolonged PT/PTT), causing bleeding/ecchymoses.",False,True,False
946,default,"A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient states that he feels out of breath and that his heart is racing. He was on a transatlantic flight when his symptoms started. He has a past medical history of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. His current medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, insulin, and metformin. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 197/108 mmHg, pulse is 160/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. An EKG is obtained as seen in Figure A. A CT pulmonary angiogram is demonstrated in Figure B. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Atrial fibrillation,Acute pulmonary embolism — a (likely saddle) PE with right‑ventricular strain. The EKG shows the classic S1Q3T3/right‑strain changes and the CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrates intraluminal filling defect(s) in the pulmonary arteries.,False,False,True
633,default,"A 60-year-old man status-post emergent laparoscopic appendectomy for a ruptured appendix is brought to the attention of the on-call surgery resident by his nurse for persistent tachycardia. Medical history is significant for hypertension. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient had been given fentanyl about 30 minutes ago for pain management. The surgery resident suspects insufficient hydration and orders a bolus of normal saline. Thirty minutes later, a code is activated for ventricular fibrillation for this patient. After 3 minutes of resuscitation, the patient has return of spontaneous circulation. Bedside echocardiogram reveals dyskinetic wall movement. A 12-lead electrocardiogram is shown in Figure A. After an extended 2-week hospital stay that was free from further complications, the patient is prepared for discharge. What is the most likely complication on which the patient should be educated at this time?",Ventricular aneurysm,"Most likely: Dressler syndrome (post‑myocardial infarction autoimmune pericarditis).

Rationale: the patient had an acute MI (VF arrest, regional wall dyskinesia and ST‑elevations). Dressler classically appears weeks (2–10 weeks) after MI. 

What to watch for: fever, pleuritic chest pain worse with inspiration and when supine, pericardial friction rub, and signs of pericardial effusion/tamponade. ECG may show diffuse ST elevation with PR depression. 

Management: usually NSAIDs or high‑dose aspirin; colchicine or corticosteroids for refractory cases; urgent drainage if tamponade develops. Advise him to seek prompt care for new chest pain, fever, dyspnea, or lightheadedness.",False,False,True
317,default,"A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of syncope. He reports sudden onset of palpitations followed by loss of consciousness while carrying his groceries to his car. He is unable to recall any further details and does not have any chest pain or dizziness. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroparesis, and osteoarthritis of the knees. Medications include lisinopril, metformin, and ondansetron as needed for nausea. He also takes methadone daily for chronic pain. Apart from an abrasion on his forehead, he appears well. His temperature is 37.2 °C (98.9 F), heart rate is 104/min and regular, and blood pressure is 135/70 mm Hg. While he is in the emergency department, he loses consciousness again. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis that spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. Results of a complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and serum thyroid studies show no abnormalities. Cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?",Prolonged QT interval,"Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes) from drug-induced QT prolongation — most likely methadone blocking the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier K+ current (hERG/IKr), causing prolonged repolarization and early afterdepolarizations leading to torsades and syncope.",False,True,False
