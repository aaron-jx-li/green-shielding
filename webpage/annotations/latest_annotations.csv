1,"Twelve hours after undergoing a femoral artery embolectomy, an 84-year-old man is found unconscious on the floor by his hospital bed. He had received a patient-controlled analgesia pump after surgery. He underwent 2 coronary bypass surgeries 2 and 6 years ago. He has coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medication include metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, sublingual nitrate, and insulin. He appears pale. His temperature is 36.1°C (97°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 88/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient does not respond to commands and withdraws his extremities to pain. Examination shows cold, clammy skin and jugular venous distention. There is ecchymosis on the right temple and maxilla. There is a surgical incision over the right thigh that shows no erythema or discharge. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. A central venous catheter is placed and hemodynamic monitoring shows: | Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) | 1600 dynes.sec/cm5 (N = 900–1400) | | --- | --- | | Right atrial pressure | 13 mm Hg (N = 3–8) | | Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) | 4 mm Hg (N = 5–16) | Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which?","Findings of a massive pulmonary embolism — for example, CT pulmonary angiography showing a large occlusive filling defect in the pulmonary artery with echocardiographic evidence of acute right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis.",Filling defect of a pulmonary artery on CT pulmonary angiography,match,True
2,"A 5-year-old female child is brought to a medical office with complaints of progressive abdominal pain that has intensified in the last 24 hours. The father reports a history of constipation, with no bowel movement for the past 72 hours and no bloody stools. She has experienced three episodes of vomiting since the previous night and is refusing food. Her medical and surgical history is unremarkable. Physical examination reveals upper abdominal distention with tympany, but no abdominal mass, involuntary guarding, or rebound tenderness is detected. What is the most probable underlying etiology of her clinical presentation?","Most likely a proximal small‑bowel obstruction from midgut volvulus due to congenital malrotation (Ladd's bands). The picture of progressive vomiting, upper abdominal tympanic distension without prior surgery (no adhesions) in a child suggests an intermittent/acute obstructive lesion from malrotation/volvulus rather than intussusception or adhesive obstruction.",Malrotation of the gut,no-match,True
3,"A 15-year-old girl with no prior medical condition seeks medical attention for increasing upper back pain and muscle tightness, which has worsened since joining her school's gymnastics team. During the osteopathic structural examination, the following finding are noted: left midthoracic paraspinal muscles are hypertonic, and the transverse processes from T2 to T8 are more anterior on the left side. These finding remain consistent during both flexion and extension movements. What is the most accurate diagnosis?",A Type I (neutral) group thoracic somatic dysfunction of T2–T8: sidebent left and rotated right. The anterior left transverse processes (consistent in flexion/extension) indicate rotation to the right in a neutral/group pattern.,T2-8 NSLRR,match,True
4,"A 44-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after losing consciousness at a shopping mall. According to her husband, she became sweaty, tremulous, and confused before collapsing. She was unconscious for 5 minutes until paramedics arrived, who measured her fingerstick glucose at 31 mg/dL and administered intramuscular glucagon. She regained consciousness during transport. Upon arrival, she is awake but drowsy and reports her last meal was 5 hours ago. Her husband mentions she has experienced headaches, milky discharge from both breasts, and nausea when fasting over the past 3 months. She works as an inpatient nurse and was treated for tuberculosis 10 years ago. Her family history is unknown due to adoption. Her temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure 101/59 mmHg, pulse 88/min, and respiration 14/min. Initial lab results are as follows: Plasma: Glucose: 54 mg/dL Insulin: 29 pmol/L (normal < 19 pmol/L) C-peptide: 272 pmol/L (normal < 200 pmol/L) Proinsulin: 8 pmol/L (normal < 5 pmol/L) ß-hydroxybutyrate: 1.2 mmol/L (normal > 2.7 mmol/L after fasting) What is the most likely cause of this patient’s hypoglycemic episode?","Endogenous hyperinsulinemia from an insulin‑secreting pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (insulinoma), most likely as part of MEN1. 

Rationale: hypoglycemia with elevated insulin, C‑peptide and proinsulin and suppressed ß‑hydroxybutyrate indicates endogenous insulin excess (rules out exogenous insulin). Galactorrhea and headaches point to a pituitary tumor (prolactinoma), consistent with MEN1 (pituitary + pancreatic endocrine tumors).",Insulinoma,match,True
5,"An 82-year-old woman with a history of moderate aortic stenosis and a drug-eluting stent for coronary artery disease is admitted to the intensive care unit with a one-day history of symptomatic hypotension and melena. She takes aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. She is resuscitated with intravenous fluids and blood products, is started on high-dose proton-pump-inhibitor therapy, and stabilizes without further bleeding. Upper and lower endoscopy are unremarkable. Which test is the most appropriate next step in evaluating this patient?","Video (capsule) endoscopy of the small bowel.  
Reason: with negative upper and lower endoscopy and no ongoing brisk bleeding, capsule endoscopy is the next best test to evaluate the small intestine; angiography is reserved for active/heavy bleeding.",Video-capsule endoscopy,no-match,True
6,"A 29-year-old primigravida at 33 weeks' gestation presents for a routine prenatal visit. She has well-controlled systemic lupus erythematosus with no flares during pregnancy. Her medication include iron, vitamin supplements, and hydroxychloroquine. She denies substance use. Her vital sign are stable with temperature 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse 70/min, respirations 17/min, and blood pressure 134/70 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Fetal assessment reveals: - Ultrasonography shows: - One rhythmic breathing episode >30 seconds in a 1-hour period - One distinct body movement and one extremity extension within 30 minutes - Deepest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid measures 2.5 cm - Nonstress test shows one heart rate acceleration with movement over 30 minutes What is the most appropriate next step in management?","This testing yields a biophysical profile of 4/10 (nonreactive NST 0, breathing and movements 0, tone 2, AF pocket 2) — an abnormal result indicating fetal compromise. The most appropriate step is expeditious delivery (prepare for immediate delivery and manage as preterm, including antenatal corticosteroids if there is time and magnesium for neuroprotection if indicated).",Administer corticosteroids and induce labor,match,True
7,"A 26-year-old man with a family history of premature myocardial infarction (father at age 40, brother at age 33) is seeking a cardiovascular risk evaluation. He has no significant medical history, does not smoke, and consumes alcohol occasionally. The patient weighs 77 kg, with a BMI of 25.8 and an abdominal circumference of 89 cm. His seated blood pressure is 116/75 mm Hg, and his heart rate is 84 beats per minute. Physical examination reveals scattered yellowish plaques in the palmar creases bilaterally. Fasting laboratory results are as follows: | | Patient value | Reference range | | --- | --- | --- | | Fasting glucose (mg/dL) | 82 | 75–100 | | Glycated hemoglobin (%) | 5.2 | 4.3–5.6 | | Total cholesterol (mg/dL) | 426 | 125–200 | | LDL cholesterol (mg/dL) | 315 | <130 | | HDL cholesterol (mg/dL) | 48 | ≥40 | | Triglycerides (mg/dL) | 310 | <150 | | Thyroid-stimulating hormone (μU/mL) | 0.9 | 0.5–4.7 | The complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and renal function test are all normal. Which condition is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?","Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia — ApoE2/E2). Reason: palmar xanthomas, markedly elevated total cholesterol with concomitant hypertriglyceridemia and premature family CAD are classic for remnant-particle accumulation (type III).",Dysbetalipoproteinemia,no-match,True
8,"A 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension and gout has been residing in a rehabilitation facility for 6 months following surgery for a right hip fracture sustained during a fall. Despite gradual improvement in mobility with physical therapy, he still requires significant assistance for walking and using the bathroom. Over the course of his stay, he has unintentionally lost 8 kg (approximately 1.5 kg per month) despite eating three meals daily, though he rarely finishes them. He feels hungry before meals but reports early satiety shortly after starting to eat. Before the fall, he lived alone and now describes himself as happy with the facility and finds the food “pretty good.” He denies symptom such as heartburn, dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea, chest pain, shortness of breath, or depression. His family history includes coronary artery disease and maternal breast cancer at age 81. On examination, his vital sign are normal, but his weight is 71 kg (down from 79 kg over 6 months). Physical examination reveals no abnormalities aside from decreased right leg length and limited mobility of the right hip. Laboratory testing shows a hematocrit of 37% (reference range, 41–53), with all other bloodwork, including a complete chemistry panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and C-reactive protein levels, within normal limits. Chest and abdominal radiographs reveal degenerative disk disease but are otherwise unremarkable. A colonoscopy performed at age 75 showed a single small hyperplastic polyp in the sigmoid colon. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?","Obtain an upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with biopsy as indicated.  

Rationale: He has significant unintentional weight loss, early satiety and new anemia—alarm features for upper‑GI malignancy. Colonoscopy was recent and unremarkable, so EGD is the next appropriate diagnostic test.",Esophagogastroduodenoscopy,match,True
9,"A 27-year-old G2P2002 woman is hospitalized on postpartum day 3 following a low transverse cesarean delivery. During morning rounds, she reports experiencing shaking chills overnight and noticing a “pus-like” discharge. She also mentions increased uterine cramping compared to the previous day. Her postpartum recovery has otherwise been uneventful, with a well-healing incision and normal vaginal bleeding. Her prenatal history includes HIV with a recent viral load of 400 copies/mL, well-controlled type I diabetes managed with insulin, and a history of neonatal herpes simplex virus encephalitis in her first child. She had no genital lesions during her most recent pregnancy. Four days prior, she presented with spontaneous rupture of membranes and labor onset. After 16 hours of slow cervical progression and arrest of descent due to cephalopelvic disproportion, a cesarean delivery was performed with prophylactic ampicillin. Delivery required manual dislodgment of the fetal head. On postpartum day 3, her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 119/82 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 14/min. Examination reveals a clean, dry incision, mild suprapubic tenderness, and foul-smelling, blood-tinged yellow discharge on her pad. Which represents the most significant risk factor for her current condition?",The cesarean delivery—especially an urgent cesarean performed after prolonged labor and rupture of membranes—is the single greatest risk factor for postpartum endometritis in this case.,C-section after onset of labor,no-match,True
10,"A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of progressive intermittent pain and swelling in both knees and right ankle and wrist for 3 months. She has been taking acetaminophen and using ice packs, both of which relieved her symptom. The affected joints feel ""stuck” and difficult to move when she wakes up in the morning, but she can move them freely after a few minutes. She has also occasional mild eye pain that resolves spontaneously. Five months ago she was diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection that resolved without treatment. Vital sign are within normal limits. Physical examination shows that the affected joints are swollen, erythematous, and tender to touch. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Slit-lamp examination shows an anterior chamber flare with sign of iris inflammation bilaterally. Laboratory studies show: | Hemoglobin | 12.6 g/dL | | --- | --- | | Leukocyte count | 8000/mm3 | | Segmented neutrophils | 76% | | Eosinophils | 1% | | Lymphocytes | 20% | | Monocytes | 3% | | Platelet count | 360,000/mm3 | | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate | 36 mm/hr | | Serum | | | Antinuclear antibodies | positive | | Rheumatoid factor | negative | Which is the most likely diagnosis?","Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pauciarticular JIA) — ANA-positive, RF-negative young girl with ≤4 chronically inflamed joints and associated chronic anterior uveitis.",Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,match,True
