    "question": "Twelve hours after undergoing a femoral artery embolectomy, an 84-year-old man is found unconscious on the floor by his hospital bed. He had received a patient-controlled analgesia pump after surgery. He underwent 2 coronary bypass surgeries 2 and 6 years ago. He has coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medication include metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, sublingual nitrate, and insulin. He appears pale. His temperature is 36.1°C (97°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 88/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient does not respond to commands and withdraws his extremities to pain. Examination shows cold, clammy skin and jugular venous distention. There is ecchymosis on the right temple and maxilla. There is a surgical incision over the right thigh that shows no erythema or discharge. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. A central venous catheter is placed and hemodynamic monitoring shows: | Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) | 1600 dynes.sec/cm5 (N = 900–1400) | | --- | --- | | Right atrial pressure | 13 mm Hg (N = 3–8) | | Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) | 4 mm Hg (N = 5–16) | Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which?",
    "default_response": "Findings of a massive pulmonary embolism — for example, CT pulmonary angiography showing a large occlusive filling defect in the pulmonary artery with echocardiographic evidence of acute right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis.",
    "truth": "Filling defect of a pulmonary artery on CT pulmonary angiography",

    "question": "A 5-year-old female child is brought to a medical office with complaints of progressive abdominal pain that has intensified in the last 24 hours. The father reports a history of constipation, with no bowel movement for the past 72 hours and no bloody stools. She has experienced three episodes of vomiting since the previous night and is refusing food. Her medical and surgical history is unremarkable. Physical examination reveals upper abdominal distention with tympany, but no abdominal mass, involuntary guarding, or rebound tenderness is detected. What is the most probable underlying etiology of her clinical presentation?",
    "default_response": "Most likely a proximal small‑bowel obstruction from midgut volvulus due to congenital malrotation (Ladd's bands). The picture of progressive vomiting, upper abdominal tympanic distension without prior surgery (no adhesions) in a child suggests an intermittent/acute obstructive lesion from malrotation/volvulus rather than intussusception or adhesive obstruction.",
    "truth": "Malrotation of the gut",
