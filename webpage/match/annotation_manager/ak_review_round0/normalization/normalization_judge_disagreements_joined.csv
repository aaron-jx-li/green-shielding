You should seek medical attention immediately. This condition may require antibiotics or other treatments to prevent complications. If you develop fever, chills, or worsening symptoms, go to the emergency room promptly.

In the meantime:
- Keep the leg elevated.
- Avoid putting weight on the affected thigh.
- Do not apply heat or massage the area.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Swollen, red, hot, and painful hard lump indicates significant inflammation/infection.
- Severe pain disproportionate to the physical findings is characteristic of necrotizing fasciitis.
- Bruising suggests possible tissue necrosis or vascular involvement.
- Systemic symptoms (flu-like symptoms, body stiffness) indicate systemic inflammatory response or sepsis.

"CORRECT","True","I have had significant left side abdominal pain for several years with no relief. Have had colonoscopy 3 years ago, ultra sound, c/t scan, MRI, even a spinal tap with no diagnosis. Suffer from chronic constipation that is not relieved byOTC laxatives, a GI gave me some Linzess which works at times. Now I am suffering left hip pain and sciatica that may or may not be related but seems more than a coincidence that it to is on the left side. The colonoscopy revealed extensive diverticulosis.","Your history of chronic left-sided abdominal pain with extensive diverticulosis, chronic constipation, and now left hip pain with sciatica suggests a complex issue that may involve both gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal or nerve-related components.

Key considerations include:

1. **Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis:** While diverticulosis itself often causes no symptoms, it can sometimes lead to chronic pain or complications like diverticulitis. Chronic inflammation or microperforations could cause persistent pain.

2. **Chronic Constipation:** This can exacerbate abdominal pain and may contribute to pelvic floor dysfunction, which can cause referred pain to the hip or lower back.

3. **Nerve Involvement:** Sciatica and hip pain on the same side raise the possibility of nerve compression or irritation, possibly from spinal issues (disc herniation, spinal stenosis) or pelvic nerve entrapment.

4. **Referred Pain:** Abdominal or pelvic pathology can sometimes cause referred pain to the hip or lower back.

Given the negative imaging and tests so far, and partial response to Linzess, it may be helpful to:

- Reassess for possible **chronic diverticular inflammation** or complications with a gastroenterologist.
- Evaluate for **pelvic floor dysfunction** or musculoskeletal causes with a physical therapist or specialist.
- Consider a **neurological evaluation** for sciatica, including MRI of the lumbar spine if not recently done.
- Explore **functional bowel disorders** like IBS, which can coexist with diverticulosis and cause chronic pain.

If symptoms worsen or new signs develop (fever, weight loss, severe pain), seek urgent care.

In summary, your symptoms likely involve overlapping GI and nerve/musculoskeletal issues. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for further evaluation and management.","extensive diverticulosis with chronic constipation (possible IBS overlap)","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is **left-sided sacroiliac joint dysfunction or referred pain from lumbar spine pathology (e.g., lumbar radiculopathy)** causing both the chronic left-sided abdominal pain and ipsilateral left hip pain with sciatica.

**Rationale:**
- Chronic left-sided abdominal pain without clear intra-abdominal pathology despite extensive GI and neuro workup suggests a non-visceral source.
- Diverticulosis is often asymptomatic and unlikely to cause persistent severe pain.
- The presence of left hip pain and sciatica on the same side points toward a musculoskeletal or neuropathic cause related to the lumbar spine or sacroiliac joint.
- Chronic constipation and partial relief with Linzess suggest some bowel motility issues but do not explain the pain pattern.
- Referred pain from lumbar nerve root irritation (e.g., L4-L5 or L5-S1 radiculopathy) or sacroiliac joint dysfunction can cause abdominal wall and hip pain mimicking visceral pain.

**Next steps:**
- Detailed musculoskeletal and neurological examination focusing on lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint.
- Consider MRI of lumbar spine if not recently done.
- Trial of physical therapy targeting lumbar/sacroiliac region.
- Possibly diagnostic nerve blocks or referral to pain specialist.

Is this something to worry? what will be the future consequences?.","At 24 weeks of pregnancy, mild prominence of the fetal renal pelvis (7mm on the left and 5.6mm on the right) is often referred to as mild pyelectasis or mild hydronephrosis. This is a relatively common finding on prenatal ultrasounds.

**Key points:**
- Mild renal pelvis dilation (usually defined as 4-10 mm in the second trimester) can be a normal variant.
- It often resolves on its own before or after birth.
- It can sometimes be associated with urinary tract obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux, but most cases are benign.
- Follow-up ultrasounds are typically recommended to monitor the dilation.
- Postnatal evaluation may be advised to ensure normal kidney function and drainage.

**What to do:**
- Continue routine prenatal care.
- Your doctor may schedule a follow-up ultrasound in the third trimester to reassess the renal pelvis size.
- After birth, if dilation persists, your pediatrician or pediatric nephrologist may perform further tests (e.g., ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram).

**In summary:**
Mild prominence of the renal pelvis at this stage is usually not a cause for immediate concern and often resolves without intervention. However, close monitoring is important to rule out any underlying issues.

If you have any specific concerns, discuss them with your obstetrician or a maternal-fetal medicine specialist for personalized advice.","Physiological ureteropelvic dilatation of pregnancy","WRONG","False","","In a 24-week pregnant woman, a renal pelvis measurement (anteroposterior diameter) of:

1. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** or **gastric motility disorder** – sometimes acid reflux or delayed stomach emptying can cause discomfort and gas sensations.
2. **Hiatal hernia** – can cause similar symptoms but may not always be obvious on routine imaging.
3. **Functional dyspepsia** – a common cause of upper abdominal discomfort without structural abnormalities.
4. **Gas trapping or aerophagia** – swallowing air or impaired gas clearance can cause the sensation of gas moving.

**Suggestions:**
- Keep a detailed food diary to identify any foods that worsen symptoms.
- Avoid large meals, fatty/spicy foods, caffeine, and carbonated drinks.
- Try smaller, more frequent meals.
- Consider a trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or antacid under medical supervision.
- Discuss with your gastroenterologist about possible gastric emptying studies or pH monitoring.
- If symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation for motility disorders or referral to a specialist in functional GI disorders may be needed.

It s really bothers me when my lips and face swell up.","Your symptoms of recurring red, itchy, round blotches on specific areas of your skin, along with intermittent lip and facial swelling, suggest a possible allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. The fact that Benadryl cream helps with itching supports an allergic or histamine-related cause. The recurrent nature and involvement of lips and face swelling raise concern for episodic angioedema or a chronic urticarial condition.

Key considerations include:
- Allergic contact dermatitis or recurrent urticaria
- Angioedema (especially with lip swelling)
- Possible triggers such as foods, medications, or environmental allergens

Given the swelling of your lips and face, which can sometimes indicate a more serious allergic reaction, it is important to:
- Avoid known or suspected allergens
- Consider seeing an allergist or dermatologist for evaluation and possible allergy testing
- Have an emergency plan if swelling worsens or you develop difficulty breathing or swallowing

If symptoms worsen or you develop breathing difficulty, seek emergency care immediately.

In summary, your symptoms likely represent a recurrent allergic skin reaction with episodic angioedema.

Key points:
- Recurrent, itchy, red round lesions on sun-exposed areas suggest **polymorphous light eruption (PMLE)** or a form of **photosensitive dermatitis**.
- Lip swelling without blisters points toward **angioedema**, possibly related to an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.

While hemorrhoids can cause blood in the stool, the severity, duration, and pattern of your symptoms suggest that other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, or even colorectal cancer need to be ruled out.

It is very important that you see your doctor as soon as possible. If your pain becomes unbearable, if you have significant bleeding, dizziness, weakness, or any other alarming symptoms, you should seek emergency care immediately.

Feeling scared is natural, but try to keep in mind that early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve outcomes. Your doctor will likely recommend diagnostic tests such as a colonoscopy, blood tests, and imaging studies to determine the cause of your symptoms and guide treatment.

**Colorectal cancer** or a significant **colonic neoplasm** (such as an adenocarcinoma) should be strongly suspected.

**Rationale:**  
- Chronic, progressive pain localized to the colon area.  
- Intermittent rectal bleeding with variable color suggests bleeding from a lesion in the colon.  
- Pain severe enough to limit movement indicates possible local invasion or obstruction.  
- Symptoms worsening over years, not typical for hemorrhoids, which usually cause painless bleeding and do not cause severe abdominal pain.

"CORRECT","True","Hi, I am a male and 29 years old.  About 2.5 weeks ago I took a fall on a dirt bike and it resulted in a bruise on upper portion of my pelvis.  There is also a somewhat mobile hard bump about the size of a pea in the bruise.  Is this normal? and Will the bump go away?","It's common to develop a bruise and some swelling or a lump after trauma like a fall. The ""mobile hard bump"" you describe could be a localized hematoma (a collection of blood under the skin) or possibly a small area of scar tissue or fat necrosis forming as part of the healing process.

In most cases, such lumps gradually decrease in size and resolve over weeks to months. However, if the bump is painful, growing, very hard, or associated with other symptoms like numbness, redness, warmth, or fever, you should see a healthcare provider for evaluation.

If the lump remains unchanged or bothersome after several more weeks, or if you have any concerns, a medical assessment including physical exam and possibly imaging (like ultrasound) can help clarify the cause and guide treatment.

In summary:
- A small, mobile lump after a bruise can be normal.
- It usually goes away over time.
- Monitor for changes or worsening symptoms.
- Seek medical evaluation if concerned or if symptoms worsen.","hematoma","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is a **myositis ossificans** or a **post-traumatic hematoma with early calcification**.

Explanation:
- The patient had trauma (fall) causing a bruise on the upper pelvis.
- After 2.5 weeks, a hard, somewhat mobile bump has developed in the bruised area.
- This suggests a localized collection of blood (hematoma) that is organizing and possibly beginning to calcify or ossify.
- Myositis ossificans is a common complication after muscle trauma, where heterotopic bone forms within the muscle, presenting as a hard mass.

Explanation:
- The patient had trauma (fall) causing a bruise on the upper pelvis.
- After 2.5 weeks, a hard, somewhat mobile bump has developed in the bruised area.
- This suggests a localized collection of blood (hematoma) that is organizing and possibly beginning to calcify or ossify.
- Myositis ossificans is a common complication after muscle trauma, where heterotopic bone forms within the muscle, presenting as a hard mass.

Blood in the urine (hematuria), frequent urination, and pressure between the rectum and vagina can be caused by several conditions, including urinary tract infections, bladder stones, or other urinary tract issues. While bladder cancer is a possibility, it is less common, especially if you are younger and without other risk factors like smoking or chemical exposure.

Given your symptoms and the use of furosemide (a diuretic), it is important to have a thorough evaluation. I strongly recommend you see a healthcare provider promptly for:

- A detailed history and physical exam
- Urine analysis and urine culture
- Imaging studies such as an ultrasound or CT scan of the urinary tract
- Possibly cystoscopy (a scope to look inside the bladder)

Early evaluation is important to determine the cause and start appropriate treatment. If you experience worsening pain, fever, or inability to urinate, seek emergency care immediately.","urinary tract infection or urinary stones or injury (bladder cancer less likely, but considered if initial workup negative)","WRONG","False","","The patient's symptoms include:

- New onset hematuria (blood in urine) not present the day before
- Frequent urination (up to 40 times/day)
- Difficulty urinating when furosemide is withheld
- Slight pressure between rectum and vagina
- Occasional blood specks on toilet paper

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is **urinary tract infection (UTI) or bladder inflammation (cystitis)** rather than bladder cancer. The frequent urination and urgency, along with hematuria and pressure symptoms, are typical of infection or inflammation. The blood specks on toilet paper suggest possible urethral or vaginal irritation or minor bleeding.

Bladder cancer usually presents with painless gross hematuria and less commonly with such extreme frequency or pressure symptoms. The rapid onset and variability of hematuria also favor infection or irritation.

Furosemide (a diuretic) increases urine output, which explains frequent urination, and withholding it causing difficulty urinating may relate to fluid balance or underlying bladder outlet issues.

**Recommended next steps:**
- Urinalysis and urine culture to check for infection
- Pelvic exam to assess vaginal or urethral sources of bleeding
- Ultrasound or cystoscopy if hematuria persists or worsens to rule out malignancy

By lately I have a been very nausea I have had awful bad discomfort in my belly and I am very very nausea and very tired. Also I have been getting dizzy spells. I am very worried. I cant lie on my stomach as it hurts so so much. Please help","I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. Your symptoms—nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, fatigue, and light bleeding—could be related to several possibilities, including side effects of the emergency contraceptive pill, an early pregnancy, or another medical condition such as an infection or gastrointestinal issue.

Important points to consider:
- The light bleeding you had could be withdrawal bleeding from the pill, but it can sometimes be confusing.
- A negative home pregnancy test 15 days after unprotected sex is reassuring but not 100% definitive, especially if taken very early or incorrectly.
- Severe abdominal pain and inability to lie on your stomach, along with dizziness, need prompt medical evaluation to rule out serious conditions like ectopic pregnancy or pelvic infection.

**What you should do:**
- Seek urgent medical attention as soon as possible, ideally at an emergency room or urgent care center.
- A healthcare provider will likely perform a physical exam, blood tests (including a quantitative hCG pregnancy test), and possibly an ultrasound to determine the cause of your symptoms.
- If you experience worsening pain, heavy bleeding, fainting, or severe dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately.

Please do not delay seeking care. Your symptoms require prompt evaluation to ensure your safety.","side effects of emergency contraception; pregnancy less likely but not excluded","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is **ectopic pregnancy**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- History of unprotected intercourse and emergency contraception use.
- Symptoms 15 days later: persistent nausea, severe abdominal pain, light vaginal bleeding, dizziness, and marked fatigue.
- Negative home pregnancy test (which can be falsely negative in ectopic pregnancy).
- Inability to lie on the abdomen due to pain suggests significant abdominal or pelvic pathology.

Ectopic pregnancy often presents with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and signs of early pregnancy complications. It can cause internal bleeding leading to dizziness and fatigue. Emergency contraception reduces but does not eliminate the risk of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy.

"CORRECT","True","hi! i have this extreme pain in my left flank and has undergone ultrasound. I just got my result and it says that I have Left mild pelviectasis. Also, it say that they found gallbladder polyps. Is this something serious. And what should be my next course? your answer will be of great help. Thank You!","Hello! 

**Left mild pelviectasis** means there is slight dilation of the renal pelvis in your left kidney. Mild pelviectasis can be due to various causes such as mild urinary obstruction, infection, or reflux, but it is often not immediately serious. However, it should be monitored and evaluated further to determine the cause.

**Gallbladder polyps** are growths on the gallbladder lining. Most gallbladder polyps are benign and asymptomatic, especially if they are small (less than 1 cm). Larger polyps or those causing symptoms may require further evaluation or removal.

**Next steps:**
1. **Consult your doctor or a urologist** about the pelviectasis to assess kidney function and rule out obstruction or infection. They may recommend further imaging or urine tests.
2. **Follow up with a gastroenterologist or your primary care physician** regarding the gallbladder polyps. They may suggest periodic ultrasound monitoring to watch for changes in size or symptoms.
3. If your pain persists or worsens, seek prompt medical attention.

In summary, mild pelviectasis and gallbladder polyps are often not immediately serious but do require medical follow-up to ensure proper management.

If you have any other symptoms like fever, severe pain, jaundice, or urinary problems, please inform your doctor urgently.","Left mild pelviectasis and gallbladder polyps","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is **left-sided renal colic due to ureteral obstruction**, possibly from a kidney stone.

Rationale:
- Extreme pain in the left flank suggests renal or ureteral pathology.
- Mild left pelviectasis (dilation of the renal pelvis) indicates some degree of urinary tract obstruction on the left side.
- Gallbladder polyps are usually incidental and asymptomatic, unlikely related to the flank pain.

Therefore, the flank pain and pelviectasis point toward obstructive uropathy, most commonly caused by a ureteral stone.

- Symptoms persisting for 2 years indicate a chronic process.
- Family history of hypertension increases cardiovascular risk.
- Physical inactivity aside from daily exercise may contribute to atherosclerosis.

"WRONG","False","hello, I am Male patient . My doctor give me two test (Testosterone its 3.98 ng/ml) and (Prolactin 10.9 ng/ml) then he prescribed me 12 injections (Koragan 5000 I.U) and said 1 injection per week. also prescribed tablet Bromocriptin for 2 months. Now am worried about this hormone injection (Koragan), is this right for me or i shouldnt use it? please suggest me what should i do.","Hello! Based on your testosterone level of 3.98 ng/ml, which is within or slightly low-normal range depending on the lab reference, and prolactin of 10.9 ng/ml (which is generally within normal limits), your doctor has prescribed Koragan (human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) injections and Bromocriptine.

**Koragan (hCG)** is often used to stimulate testosterone production in men, especially if there is low testosterone or issues with testicular function. It mimics luteinizing hormone (LH) and can help increase your body's own testosterone production.

**Bromocriptine** is used to lower elevated prolactin levels, but your prolactin seems normal, so your doctor might be using it as a precaution or for other reasons.

**What you should do:**
- Discuss your concerns directly with your doctor. Ask why they prescribed Koragan and Bromocriptine given your test results.
- Do not stop or start any medication without your doctor's advice.
- If you experience side effects or feel unsure, seek a second opinion from an endocrinologist.

In summary, Koragan injections can be appropriate if your doctor suspects low testosterone production despite your current levels. Your doctor’s prescription is likely based on your overall clinical picture, not just these two lab values. Always follow your doctor’s guidance and clarify any doubts with them.","male infertility associated with hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadism","CORRECT","True","","The patient's testosterone level of 3.98 ng/ml is within or slightly below the normal adult male range (typically about 3-10 ng/ml, depending on the lab), and the prolactin level of 10.9 ng/ml is within the normal range (usually up to ~15 ng/ml for males).

Koragan (human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) 5000 I.U. injections stimulate the testes to produce testosterone by mimicking luteinizing hormone (LH). Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist used to lower elevated prolactin levels, typically in cases of hyperprolactinemia.

Given the treatment with both hCG and bromocriptine, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Hypogonadism secondary to hyperprolactinemia (possibly due to a prolactinoma or other cause of elevated prolactin).**

- Elevated prolactin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to low LH and FSH, and consequently low testosterone.
- Bromocriptine reduces prolactin levels.
- hCG stimulates testosterone production directly in the testes.

Even though the prolactin is currently within normal limits, it may have been elevated previously or borderline, prompting treatment.

**Summary:** The patient likely has secondary hypogonadism caused by hyperprolactinemia, and the prescribed treatment with Koragan (hCG) and bromocriptine is appropriate to restore testosterone levels and reduce prolactin.

1. **Infectious causes:** Recent bronchitis or other respiratory infections can cause inflammatory nodules or granulomas.
2. **Benign tumors or scars:** Prior infections or inflammation can leave small nodules.
3. **Less likely malignancy:** Although lung cancer is rare at your age and with minimal smoking, it cannot be completely ruled out without further evaluation.

Your other symptoms—voice loss, chronic cough, blood in stools, and headaches—are likely unrelated to the lung nodule but should be evaluated separately:

- **Blood in stools:** This needs urgent evaluation by a gastroenterologist to rule out causes like hemorrhoids, polyps, or more serious conditions.
- **Voice loss and cough:** Could be related to your bronchitis or irritation of the vocal cords.
- **Headaches and ear pain:** May be due to ear infections, migraines, or other neurological causes.

**Next steps:**
- Follow-up with a pulmonologist for further imaging (CT scan) and possibly a biopsy or PET scan to characterize the nodule.
- Gastroenterology evaluation for blood in stools.
- ENT or neurology consult for voice loss and headaches.

   - Persistent cough aligns with airway irritation or lung pathology.

3. **Intermittent blood in stools for several years:**  
   - Suggests a chronic gastrointestinal issue, possibly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or a bleeding lesion like polyps or malignancy.

4. **Recurrent left-sided headaches with ear pain:**  
   - Could be related to referred pain or a separate neurological/ENT issue.

**Most likely unifying diagnosis:**

- The combination of a lung nodule causing recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (voice loss), chronic blood in stools, and systemic symptoms suggests a systemic disease with lung and GI involvement.

- **Carcinoid tumor or neuroendocrine tumor** of the lung can cause a lung nodule and paraneoplastic symptoms but does not explain blood in stools.

- **Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (IBD)** can cause intermittent blood in stools and extraintestinal manifestations, including lung involvement (rarely nodules), and systemic symptoms.

- **Metastatic disease from a GI primary tumor (e.g., colorectal cancer) to the lung** is possible but less likely in a 20-year-old without other symptoms.

- **Lynch syndrome or familial polyposis syndromes** can cause GI bleeding and early cancers, including lung involvement.

I feel the heaviness on left sde of my face and feel a pain also radiating in the left shoulder till back of the ear and sometimes reaching on the let eyebrow.Will hysiotherepy help me.","Your symptoms—dizziness when turning your head, tendency to fall to the left side, feeling of heaviness and pain on the left side of your face radiating to the shoulder, ear, and eyebrow—suggest a possible vestibular (inner ear or balance system) disorder or a neurological issue affecting balance and facial sensation.

The medications you mentioned (Stugeron and Vertin) are commonly used for vertigo and dizziness, but persistent or worsening symptoms after a month warrant further evaluation.

Possible causes include:
- Vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis (inner ear inflammation)
- Cervical spine issues causing nerve irritation
- Vestibular migraine
- Neurological conditions such as a minor stroke or nerve compression

Given the tendency to fall and the facial pain/heaviness, it is important to see a neurologist or ENT specialist promptly for a thorough examination, including balance tests and possibly imaging (MRI or CT scan).

Physiotherapy, especially vestibular rehabilitation therapy, can be very helpful once the diagnosis is clear. It helps improve balance and reduce dizziness.

**Recommendation:**
- Seek urgent medical evaluation to rule out serious causes.
- Continue medications as prescribed until reviewed.
- Discuss vestibular physiotherapy after specialist assessment.

If you experience sudden weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or severe headache, seek emergency care immediately.","probable neurological disorder (etiology undetermined)","WRONG","False","","The patient's symptoms—dizziness triggered by head movement (downward and to the left), tendency to fall to the left side, facial heaviness, and pain radiating from the left side of the face to the shoulder, behind the ear, and to the eyebrow—suggest involvement of the vestibular and possibly cranial nerve structures on the left side.

Given the history and progression despite treatment with Stugeron (cinnarizine) and Vertin (betahistine), the most likely diagnosis is **left-sided vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis**, possibly complicated by involvement of the trigeminal nerve or cervical nerve roots causing referred pain.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Vertigo/dizziness worsened by head movement (vestibular involvement)
- Falling tendency to the left (vestibular imbalance)
- Facial heaviness and radiating pain (possible cranial nerve or cervical nerve irritation)
- Pain distribution (behind ear, shoulder, eyebrow) suggests involvement beyond just vestibular nerve, possibly involving cervical nerves or trigeminal nerve branches.

Other differential diagnoses to consider:
- **Left cerebellar or brainstem stroke** (needs urgent exclusion)
- **Cervical spondylosis with nerve root irritation**
- **Meniere’s disease** (less likely with pain and facial heaviness)
- **Trigeminal neuralgia or occipital neuralgia** (pain pattern)

**Recommended next steps:**
- Urgent neurological evaluation to rule out central causes (MRI brain and brainstem)
- Vestibular function tests
- Assessment of cervical spine

Given the history and progression despite treatment with Stugeron (cinnarizine) and Vertin (betahistine), the most likely diagnosis is **left-sided vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis**, possibly complicated by involvement of the trigeminal nerve or cervical nerve roots causing referred pain.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Vertigo/dizziness worsened by head movement (vestibular involvement)
- Falling tendency to the left (vestibular imbalance)
- Facial heaviness and radiating pain (possible cranial nerve or cervical nerve irritation)
- Pain distribution (behind ear, shoulder, eyebrow) suggests involvement beyond just vestibular nerve, possibly involving cervical nerves or trigeminal nerve branches.

Other differential diagnoses to consider:
- **Left cerebellar or brainstem stroke** (needs urgent exclusion)
- **Cervical spondylosis with nerve root irritation**
- **Meniere’s disease** (less likely with pain and facial heaviness)
- **Trigeminal neuralgia or occipital neuralgia** (pain pattern)

"CORRECT","True","I have Hep c and last yr when tested they said my viral load was dorment? can you tell me when should i see someone about getting treated and what are the signs, i also take a numerous amount of  pysc meds and currently on suboxone but i dont want to take the suboxone all my life ...lately i am having alot of pain in abdomen area","If your Hepatitis C viral load was dormant (undetectable) last year, it means the virus was not actively replicating at that time. However, Hep C can reactivate, so regular monitoring is important.

**When to see a doctor for treatment:**
- If your viral load becomes detectable again.
- If you have abnormal liver function tests (elevated liver enzymes).
- If you develop symptoms such as abdominal pain, fatigue, jaundice, or swelling.
- To discuss current antiviral treatments, which are highly effective and can cure Hep C in most cases.

**Signs to watch for that need prompt medical attention:**
- Persistent or worsening abdominal pain, especially in the upper right side.
- Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice).
- Unexplained weight loss or fatigue.
- Swelling in the abdomen or legs.
- Dark urine or pale stools.

Since you are on multiple psychiatric medications and Suboxone, it is important to coordinate care with your healthcare providers to avoid drug interactions and manage your medications safely.

**Next steps:**
- Schedule an appointment with a hepatologist or your primary care doctor for liver evaluation and viral load testing.
- Discuss your abdominal pain promptly to rule out liver-related complications or other causes.
- Talk about your desire to taper off Suboxone; this should be done under medical supervision.

If your abdominal pain is severe or worsening, seek medical attention urgently.","Chronic Hepatitis C infection with low/dormant viral load","WRONG","False","","In a patient with chronic hepatitis C infection whose viral load was previously dormant, the development of significant abdominal pain raises concern for possible liver-related complications.

- **Hepatic inflammation or flare** causing abdominal pain.
- **Hepatic decompensation** (e.g., ascites, portal hypertension).
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma** (less likely without other signs but should be considered).

Additionally, psychiatric medications including suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) are metabolized by the liver and could contribute to liver stress or drug-induced liver injury, exacerbating symptoms.

"WRONG","False","My earholes begin to swell up when I wear earrings, and they form pus when I touch them. Is this because Im not wearing gold earrings or is it because Ive developed an infection?This has happened twice.I usually wear gold earrings and have been for 16 years.I wear plastic ear sticks too.","Your symptoms—swelling and pus formation at the earlobes after wearing earrings—strongly suggest an infection, likely from irritation or a bacterial infection at the piercing site. Even if you usually wear gold earrings, infections can still occur due to:

- Allergic reactions to metals or plastic (even gold alloys can sometimes cause sensitivity)
- Poor hygiene or bacteria introduced during handling
- Trauma or irritation from earrings or plastic ear sticks

Since this has happened twice, it’s important to:

1. Stop wearing earrings temporarily to allow healing.
2. Clean the area gently with saline solution.
3. Avoid touching or manipulating the earlobes.
4. Consider seeing a healthcare provider for evaluation and possible antibiotic treatment if the infection persists or worsens.

If you suspect a metal allergy, you might want to try hypoallergenic earrings (e.g., surgical steel or titanium) after healing.

In summary, this is most likely an infection rather than just a reaction to not wearing gold. Prompt care can prevent complications.","allergic contact dermatitis with secondary infection","CORRECT","True","","The most likely diagnosis is **contact dermatitis with secondary infection** (likely bacterial otitis externa or localized skin infection).

Explanation:
- Swelling and pus formation at the earholes suggest an inflammatory reaction with infection.
- The fact that symptoms occur when wearing earrings indicates a local reaction, possibly due to irritation or allergy.
- Although the patient has worn gold earrings for 16 years without issues, the use of plastic ear sticks or a change in earring material or hygiene could trigger irritation or infection.
- Pus formation indicates bacterial involvement, likely from skin flora entering through minor skin breaks caused by irritation or scratching.

Recommendation:
- Avoid wearing earrings temporarily.
- Clean the area gently and apply topical antibiotic ointment.
- If symptoms worsen or persist, see a healthcare provider for possible oral antibiotics and evaluation for allergy testing.

"CORRECT","True","Hi doctor, im 21 year old male.My problem is that, i get colourless liquid out when i shake my penis for sometimes & sometimes when i pressurize for urine at the time during stool, sperm comes out & also im not getting proper erection. Am I getting impotent? if yes, then what is the cure for this?","Hello. The symptoms you describe—colorless liquid discharge when shaking your penis, ejaculation during straining to urinate or during bowel movements, and difficulty achieving a proper erection—could indicate a few possible issues such as:

1. **Prostate or seminal vesicle issues** (e.g., prostatitis or inflammation) causing abnormal discharge and ejaculation.
2. **Ejaculatory duct obstruction or dysfunction**.
3. **Erectile dysfunction (ED)**, which can have physical or psychological causes.
4. Possible urinary tract infection or other urogenital conditions.

This is not necessarily impotence (complete inability to have an erection), but your erectile difficulties should be evaluated.

**What to do:**
- See a urologist for a thorough physical exam.
- You may need urine tests, semen analysis, and possibly imaging (ultrasound).
- Treatment depends on the diagnosis but may include antibiotics (if infection), medications for ED, or other targeted therapies.

Avoid self-medicating and seek professional evaluation promptly to address these symptoms effectively.","erectile dysfunction (likely psychogenic); normal bulbourethral gland secretion","WRONG","False","","The symptoms described—intermittent release of a colorless liquid from the penis upon shaking, ejaculation during straining (urine or stool), and difficulty achieving a proper erection—are suggestive of **retrograde ejaculation**.

**Explanation:**
- The colorless liquid released intermittently is likely seminal fluid.
- Ejaculation during straining suggests abnormal retrograde flow of semen into the bladder rather than out through the urethra.
- Difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection can be associated with underlying neurological or structural issues affecting the ejaculatory mechanism.

**Most likely diagnosis:** Retrograde ejaculation, possibly due to dysfunction of the internal urethral sphincter or autonomic nerve injury.

Further evaluation with post-ejaculatory urine analysis (to detect sperm in urine) and assessment of neurological function is recommended.","erectile dysfunction (likely psychogenic); normal bulbourethral gland secretion","False","False","True","False","False","True","False","True","True","False","False","The symptoms described—intermittent release of a colorless liquid from the penis upon shaking, ejaculation during straining (urine or stool), and difficulty achieving a proper erection—are suggestive of **retrograde ejaculation**.

"CORRECT","True","i was punched in the chest area above my left breast, but below the clavicle. No bruising, but tender to touch, and hurts when I laugh, cough and sneeze. It happened 4 days ago. is it probably just bruised internally, or am I still at risk for a collapsed lung or pneumothorax?","Your symptoms—tenderness without bruising, and pain with laughing, coughing, and sneezing—are consistent with a soft tissue injury such as a bruise or muscle strain. However, chest trauma can sometimes cause more serious issues like a pneumothorax (collapsed lung), even without obvious external signs.

Signs that would raise concern for pneumothorax or other serious injury include:
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
- Sharp, worsening chest pain
- Rapid heart rate or dizziness
- Cyanosis (bluish lips or fingertips)

Since it has been 4 days and you have no breathing difficulties or worsening symptoms, a serious complication is less likely but not impossible. If you develop any of the above symptoms or if the pain worsens, you should seek immediate medical evaluation.

For now:
- Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity
- Use over-the-counter pain relief as needed
- Monitor for any new or worsening symptoms

If you have any doubt or persistent pain, a chest X-ray can help rule out fractures or pneumothorax. It’s best to consult a healthcare provider for a thorough assessment.","muscular injury (most likely), but rib fracture, pulmonary contusion, and pneumothorax must be ruled out","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is a **costochondral or costosternal contusion (chest wall contusion)** or a **costochondritis** (inflammation of the costal cartilage).

- Tenderness to touch without bruising.
- Pain worsened by activities that increase intrathoracic pressure (laughing, coughing, sneezing).
- Onset 4 days ago, consistent with a soft tissue injury or inflammation.

Fracture is less likely without severe trauma or deformity, and absence of bruising makes superficial hematoma less likely. Rib fracture would typically cause more localized pain and possibly bruising.

- **Irritant-induced asthma (Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome - RADS)**: A form of asthma triggered by exposure to irritants.
- **Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD)**: Can cause voice changes and breathing difficulty triggered by irritants.
- **Allergic or non-allergic rhinitis with lower airway involvement**.
- **Environmental or occupational irritant sensitivity**.

Given your symptoms and oxygen changes, it is important to see a healthcare provider for:

- Detailed respiratory evaluation including lung function tests.
- Possible referral to a pulmonologist or allergist.

RADS is a form of irritant-induced asthma that occurs after a single high-level exposure to respiratory irritants (such as strong odors, chemicals, or dust) in individuals without prior asthma or reactive airway disease. It presents with asthma-like symptoms shortly after exposure.

Key points supporting RADS:
- No prior history of asthma or respiratory disease
- Symptoms triggered by irritants (perfumes, dust)
- Acute onset of airway hyperreactivity and respiratory distress

- Use a supportive pillow that keeps your neck aligned with your spine while sleeping.
- Avoid prolonged forward head posture (e.g., looking down at phones or computers).
- Apply gentle heat or cold packs to the neck to reduce pain and inflammation.
- Perform gentle neck stretches and range-of-motion exercises as tolerated.
- Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help.

Common causes include:

1. **Physiological (normal) causes:** Small amounts of fluid can be normal, especially around ovulation or menstruation.
2. **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):** Infection causing inflammation and fluid accumulation.
3. **Ovarian cyst rupture or hemorrhage:** Can release fluid into the pouch.
4. **Endometriosis:** Can cause fluid and inflammation.
5. **Ectopic pregnancy:** A medical emergency, but usually with more symptoms.
6. **Ascites:** Fluid from liver, kidney, or heart problems, but usually more generalized.

**Is minimal free fluid harmful?**  
Minimal free fluid alone is often not harmful and can be a normal finding. However, the underlying cause needs to be identified.

**Does it affect kidney or heart?**  
Free fluid in the pouch of Douglas itself does not directly affect the kidneys or heart. However, systemic conditions like heart failure or kidney disease can cause fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites), but this is usually more extensive.

**Your symptoms (left lower back ache, pain on the left side, difficulty breathing):**  
These symptoms are concerning and may not be directly related to minimal free fluid. They could indicate other issues such as musculoskeletal problems, kidney issues (like stones or infection), or even cardiac or lung problems.

**Recommendations:**

- **Left-sided lower back pain radiating along the left side:** Could indicate musculoskeletal causes, renal pathology (e.g., left-sided kidney issues), or referred pain from other organs.
- **Difficulty breathing:** This is concerning and may suggest systemic involvement or referred pain affecting the diaphragm or pleura.

**Most likely diagnosis:**
- **Left-sided renal pathology (e.g., left-sided pyelonephritis or renal colic from a kidney stone):** This can cause flank pain radiating along the side and may cause reactive peritoneal irritation leading to minimal free fluid.
- **Alternatively, a ruptured ovarian cyst or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):** Can cause free fluid and pelvic pain but less commonly causes difficulty breathing.
- **The difficulty breathing may be due to pain-related splinting or referred diaphragmatic irritation.**

1. See a healthcare provider for a blood pregnancy test, which is more sensitive than HPTs.
2. Get a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate the uterus and ovaries.
3. Discuss your symptoms and menstrual changes with your provider for further evaluation.

"CORRECT","True","Hi, by the time my baby girl was 3weeks old she drank 5-7 oz of breast milk or formula every 3hrs. I noticed a huge difference in her milk intake by 3months. She would only drink 3oz sometimes even less and it was always a struggle at feeding times. Now at 7months old its still a struggle to get her to drink a bottle. What s wrong?","It's common for babies' feeding patterns to change as they grow. By 3 to 7 months, many infants start eating less milk because they begin to eat solid foods, which can reduce their milk intake. However, if your baby is consistently drinking much less milk than expected and feeding is a struggle, consider these possibilities:

1. **Teething discomfort** – Teething can make sucking painful.
2. **Preference for breastfeeding** – Some babies prefer breast over bottle.
3. **Feeding technique or bottle nipple issues** – The flow might be too fast or slow.
4. **Illness or oral discomfort** – Check for thrush, mouth sores, or infections.
5. **Developmental changes** – Babies become more distracted and less interested in feeding.

If your baby is gaining weight well, has normal wet and dirty diapers, and seems generally healthy, this pattern may be normal. However, if you notice poor weight gain, dehydration signs, or persistent feeding difficulties, consult your pediatrician for evaluation and guidance.","Normal feeding pattern for age if baby is active and playful","WRONG","False","","The key features are:

- Progressive decrease in milk intake starting at 3 weeks of age

This presentation suggests a progressive feeding difficulty starting in early infancy.

**Most likely diagnosis: Esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF)** is unlikely here because symptoms usually present immediately after birth with choking, coughing, and inability to feed.

**Congenital esophageal stricture or web** could cause progressive feeding difficulties but usually presents with choking or vomiting.

**Pyloric stenosis** typically presents with projectile vomiting and is usually diagnosed by 2-8 weeks of age.

**Congenital heart disease** can cause poor feeding but usually has other signs like cyanosis or failure to thrive.

**Congenital or acquired neuromuscular disorders** (e.g., cerebral palsy, hypotonia) can cause poor feeding but usually have other neurological signs.

**Most likely diagnosis: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS)**

It feels like my vas deferans is swollen, no pain during ejaculation or urination but it seems to agrevate the feelings for a day after","Your symptoms of ache or itchy pain in the lower abdomen near the top of the right testicle, with a sensation of swelling in the vas deferens, but no pain during ejaculation or urination, could be due to several possible causes, including:

1. **Epididymitis** (inflammation of the epididymis) – often causes localized pain and swelling.
2. **Spermatic cord or vas deferens irritation** – possibly from minor trauma or inflammation.
3. **Inguinal hernia** – sometimes causes discomfort in that area.
4. **Varicocele or hydrocele** – can cause a feeling of heaviness or discomfort.
5. **Nerve irritation or referred pain** from the lower abdomen.

Since the pain has neither worsened nor improved, and there is no urinary or ejaculation pain, it is less likely to be an acute infection but still warrants evaluation.

**Recommended next steps:**
- See a healthcare provider or urologist for a physical exam.
- An ultrasound of the scrotum and groin may be needed to assess for swelling, hernia, or other abnormalities.
- Urinalysis or STI screening if infection is suspected.

- Location: Pain near the top of the testicle corresponds to the epididymis.
- Sensation of swelling along the vas deferens suggests involvement of the spermatic cord structures.
- Absence of acute severe pain or systemic symptoms makes acute epididymitis or testicular torsion less likely.

Based on your description:

- A black stain on the tongue that changed to yellow.
- A small yellow boil on the lip.
- Possible gum boil.
- Baby is 6 months old.

This could be an oral infection such as thrush (oral candidiasis) or a minor oral ulcer/infection. The black discoloration might be from food or a fungal infection, and the yellow boil could be a small abscess or irritation.

**Recommendations:**
1. Avoid giving solid foods like carrots until the mouth heals to prevent irritation.
2. Keep the baby's mouth clean by gently wiping with a clean, damp cloth.
3. Monitor for other symptoms like fever, irritability, or feeding difficulties.
4. It is important to have a pediatrician or pediatric dentist examine your baby promptly to confirm the diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.

- Dark stain on the tongue that changed color after feeding (carrot baby food can stain oral lesions).
- Appearance of small yellow lesions on the lip and gum resembling boils, which may be candidal plaques or early mucosal lesions.
- Common in infants due to immature immune systems and possible disruption of oral flora.

The ""black"" lesion initially is likely a thick pseudomembrane or fungal plaque that can appear dark and then change color with food.

**Recommendations:**
- Oral candidiasis is common and treatable with antifungal agents (e.g., nystatin oral suspension).

Your symptoms and clinical course suggest a possible ongoing or partially treated gastrointestinal infection or inflammation, possibly involving the biliary tract or kidneys given the upper right abdominal pain and mild kidney pain.

Here are some important points and recommendations:

1. **Recurrent Symptoms After Antibiotics:**  
   Recurrence of pain and diarrhea after completing antibiotics may indicate:  
   - Incomplete eradication of infection  
   - Resistant or different pathogen  
   - Non-infectious causes (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, biliary issues)

2. **Current Findings:**  
   - Stool with 10-12 pus cells suggests ongoing intestinal inflammation or infection.  
   - Normal stool and urine cultures may miss some pathogens or parasites.  
   - Mild bladder wall thickening indicates inflammation but no clear source yet.  
   - Kidney pain needs careful monitoring to exclude pyelonephritis or other renal pathology.

3. **Further Investigations Recommended:**  
   - Repeat stool culture including tests for parasites, Clostridium difficile toxin, and ova & parasites.  
   - Blood tests: CBC, CRP/ESR (inflammation markers), liver function tests, renal function tests.  
   - Abdominal imaging: Consider repeat ultrasound or CT scan focusing on liver, gallbladder, biliary tree, and kidneys.  
   - Possibly stool PCR panels for enteric pathogens if available.  
   - Urine culture and sensitivity to rule out urinary tract infection.

4. **Regarding Antibiotics and Flagyl (Metronidazole):**  
   - Ciprofloxacin plus Flagyl is often used to cover both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including some protozoa.  
   - Protozole (likely metronidazole) is important if protozoal infection (e.g., amoebiasis) is suspected.  
   - Repeating the same antibiotics without clear evidence of infection or sensitivity may not be effective and can promote resistance.  
   - It is important to tailor antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity results.

5. **Next Steps:**  
   - Consult a gastroenterologist or infectious disease specialist for further evaluation.  
   - Avoid self-medicating with antibiotics without guidance.  
   - Monitor kidney pain closely; if it worsens or you develop fever, seek urgent care.  
   - Maintain hydration and supportive care.

**Summary:**  
Do not repeat antibiotics blindly. Get further stool and blood tests, possibly imaging, to identify the cause. Flagyl is important if protozoal infection is confirmed or strongly suspected. Kidney pain needs careful monitoring. Specialist consultation is advised.

If symptoms worsen (high fever, severe pain, vomiting, decreased urine output), seek emergency care promptly.

Stay well and follow up with your healthcare provider for tailored management.","persistent gastrointestinal infection (likely bacterial)","WRONG","False","","The clinical picture is of a middle-aged woman with initial abdominal pain, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics including ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. The pain localized to the right upper abdomen, and ultrasound showed mild bladder wall thickening but no other abnormalities. Symptoms partially improved but recurred after stopping antibiotics, with ongoing abdominal pain and diarrhea. Stool showed pus cells but no clear pathogen identified.

Key points:
- Initial presentation: abdominal pain, fever, nausea, diarrhea
- Partial response to antibiotics but relapse after stopping
- Mild bladder inflammation on ultrasound
- Stool with pus cells (suggestive of inflammation/infection)
- Mild bilateral kidney pain (no clear evidence of pyelonephritis)
- No vomiting or chills currently
- Uncertain if further antibiotics or investigations are needed

Most likely diagnosis:
**Amebic liver abscess or amebiasis with possible colitis**

Rationale:
- The right upper quadrant pain and fever suggest possible liver involvement.
- Amebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica) is common in Egypt and can cause colitis and liver abscess.
- Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for amebiasis; however, if the abscess is present, symptoms may persist or recur if not fully treated.
- Stool pus cells indicate colitis but no bacterial pathogen was identified.
- Ciprofloxacin and nifuroxazide would not treat amebiasis effectively.
- Mild bladder thickening may be reactive or unrelated.
- Kidney pain is mild and likely referred or nonspecific.

Next steps:
- Perform serologic testing for Entamoeba histolytica antibodies.
- Consider abdominal imaging (ultrasound or CT) focused on the liver to rule out abscess.
- Stool antigen or PCR testing for Entamoeba histolytica.
- If amebiasis confirmed, a full course of metronidazole followed by a luminal agent (e.g., paromomycin) is needed.
- Avoid repeating broad-spectrum antibiotics without clear bacterial infection.

- Enlarged lymph node
- Thyroid nodule or thyroid enlargement (especially if near the thyroid gland)
- Lipoma (a benign fatty lump)
- Other benign cysts or masses

Since it is painless and fixed, it is less likely to be an acute infection but still important to evaluate.

**What you should do:**
- Monitor the lump for changes in size, pain, or other symptoms (such as difficulty swallowing, voice changes, or weight loss).
- See a healthcare provider for a physical exam.
- They may order imaging (like ultrasound) or blood tests (thyroid function tests) to determine the cause.

**When to seek urgent care:**
- Rapid growth of the lump
- Pain, redness, or warmth over the lump
- Difficulty breathing or swallowing
- Associated systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss

In summary, while it may be benign, it is advisable to have a healthcare professional evaluate the lump to rule out any serious conditions.","enlarged lymph node (possible inflammation or malignancy)","WRONG","False","","A palpable, non-tender, fixed lump located just above the sternum at the jugular notch, slightly to the right side and lateral to the esophagus, is most likely an **enlarged right thyroid lobe or a thyroid nodule**.

"CORRECT","True","My brother had DBS surgery for Parkinson s 5 months ago. As a result he is getting more tremors - like nothing he had before.

This phenomenon is recognized but not very common.

It is important for your brother's neurologist or DBS specialist to carefully review the DBS programming and consider adjustments, as tremors can sometimes be managed by changing stimulation parameters. Additional evaluation may also help differentiate Parkinsonian tremor from essential tremor features.

Explanation:
- Parkinson's disease tremor and essential tremor have different characteristics and respond differently to treatments.
- DBS targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPi) is effective for PD tremor but may not control or can even unmask an underlying essential tremor.
- A family history of essential tremor supports the presence of a coexisting ET.

Explanation:
- Parkinson's disease tremor and essential tremor have different characteristics and respond differently to treatments.
- DBS targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPi) is effective for PD tremor but may not control or can even unmask an underlying essential tremor.
- A family history of essential tremor supports the presence of a coexisting ET.
- The new tremors appearing after DBS, differing from the original PD tremor, suggest that DBS suppressed the PD tremor but revealed the ET.

"CORRECT","True","Im a 16 year old girl, over the last few days Ive been very tired and week. Ive also experienced constant nausea and light-headedness. It worsens when loud noises are made. I went to the obgyn for an annual visit yesterday, she said my blood pressure was 90/50. I was wondering if this could have anything to do with low/high blood pressure? Should I seek medical attention?","Your symptoms of tiredness, weakness, constant nausea, and light-headedness, along with a low blood pressure reading of 90/50 mmHg, could be related. Low blood pressure (hypotension) can cause these symptoms, especially if it leads to reduced blood flow to the brain.

Since your symptoms are persistent and worsen with stimuli like loud noises, it is important to seek medical attention promptly. A healthcare provider can evaluate you thoroughly to determine the cause, rule out other conditions (such as anemia, dehydration, or infections), and provide appropriate treatment.

If you experience any severe symptoms like fainting, chest pain, severe headache, difficulty breathing, or confusion, seek emergency care immediately.","low blood pressure (hypotension), possible anemia","WRONG","False","","The 16-year-old female's symptoms—fatigue, weakness, constant nausea, light-headedness, and worsening with loud noises—along with low blood pressure (90/50 mmHg) suggest **Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency)**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Fatigue, weakness, nausea, and light-headedness are classic symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.
- Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common due to mineralocorticoid deficiency.
- Sensitivity to stressors like loud noises can exacerbate symptoms.
- Addison's disease often presents in adolescence or young adulthood.

"CORRECT","True","I have chronic pain everyday in the same location, left shoulder blade, left lateral neck and behind left ear. it is a deep pain, feels like an ice pick. I have had a left mandibular joint replacement for a disc that was almost gone. I have had a 4 level ACDF for 4 herniated discs,C3-7. it has been 7 months since the ACDF and I still have the same pain. I don t know what to do anymore. I only take advil for pain, stretch and use hot packs. Do I just live with this?","Your chronic deep, ice-pick-like pain in the left shoulder blade, lateral neck, and behind the ear, persisting 7 months after a 4-level ACDF and prior TMJ joint replacement, is concerning and warrants further evaluation.

Possible causes include:
- Nerve irritation or persistent radiculopathy from cervical spine surgery
- Adjacent segment disease or incomplete resolution of disc pathology
- TMJ-related referred pain or muscle dysfunction
- Neuropathic pain or nerve entrapment (e.g., occipital neuralgia)
- Muscular or myofascial pain syndrome

Recommendations:
1. **Follow-up with your spine surgeon or neurologist** for a thorough clinical evaluation and possibly repeat imaging (MRI or CT) to assess fusion status, nerve compression, or new pathology.
2. **Consider referral to a pain specialist** for assessment of neuropathic pain and possible interventions (nerve blocks, medications like gabapentin or amitriptyline).
3. **Physical therapy** focusing on cervical stabilization and posture may help.
4. **Avoid relying solely on NSAIDs** like Advil; they may not adequately control neuropathic or deep nerve pain.
5. **Evaluate TMJ function** with your oral surgeon or dentist, as TMJ issues can cause referred pain.

Do not just live with this pain without further evaluation. Persistent pain after major surgery requires a multidisciplinary approach to identify and treat the underlying cause. Please seek prompt medical reassessment.","Persistent pain after ACDF, possible ongoing cervical disc pathology or articular pain","WRONG","False","","The patient's symptoms—chronic, sharp, deep pain localized to the left shoulder blade, left lateral neck, and behind the left ear—along with a history of extensive cervical spine surgery (C3-C7 ACDF) and prior TMJ replacement, suggest a neuropathic pain syndrome rather than a purely musculoskeletal cause.

Key points supporting the diagnosis:

- **Pain distribution:** The areas described correspond to the sensory distribution of the upper cervical nerves (C2-C4), which innervate the neck, shoulder blade region, and areas behind the ear.
- **Pain quality:** Sharp, ice-pick-like pain is characteristic of neuropathic pain.
- **Surgical history:** ACDF from C3 to C7 may have altered or injured cervical nerve roots or the cervical plexus, leading to persistent neuropathic pain.
- **Lack of improvement with NSAIDs and conservative measures:** Suggests pain is not primarily inflammatory or mechanical.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
**Cervical post-surgical neuropathic pain (cervical radiculopathy or cervical plexus neuralgia) secondary to nerve injury or irritation after ACDF surgery.**

Additional considerations:  
- Occipital neuralgia (C2 nerve involvement) could explain pain behind the ear and lateral neck.  
- Persistent or recurrent radicular pain from residual or adjacent segment disease.  
- TMJ-related pain is less likely given the prior joint replacement and unchanged symptoms post-ACDF.

**Recommended next steps:**  
- Neurological examination focusing on sensory deficits or allodynia.  
- Imaging (MRI cervical spine) to rule out residual or new nerve root compression.  
- Consider referral to pain specialist for neuropathic pain management (e.g., gabapentinoids, nerve blocks).  
- Physical therapy focusing on neural mobilization.

Since your periods are irregular (every 45-50 days), it can be challenging to predict your fertile window for pregnancy. Here are some steps you can take to improve your chances:

1. **Track Ovulation:** Use ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) which detect the LH surge before ovulation. This helps identify your fertile days even with irregular cycles.

2. **Monitor Basal Body Temperature (BBT):** Taking your temperature daily can help detect ovulation patterns over time.

3. **Consult a Gynecologist:** Irregular periods can be due to various causes like hormonal imbalances, PCOS, thyroid issues, or others. A doctor can evaluate you with blood tests and ultrasound to find the cause and suggest treatment.

4. **Maintain Healthy Lifestyle:** Your BMI is around 27 (64 kg, 154 cm), which is slightly overweight. Losing some weight through balanced diet and exercise can help regulate cycles and improve fertility.

5. **Consider Fertility Supplements:** After consulting your doctor, certain supplements like folic acid and vitamins may support fertility.

If you have been trying for 6 months or more without success, or if you have other symptoms (excess hair growth, acne, severe pain), please see a fertility specialist for further evaluation.

- Musculoskeletal issues (e.g., muscle strain, arthritis)
- Cardiac causes (atypical angina can sometimes present with arm/neck pain)
- Other serious conditions (e.g., thoracic spine problems, referred pain from internal organs)

Because the pain is persistent, spreading, and disturbing your sleep, you should seek urgent medical attention to rule out serious causes such as heart problems or nerve compression.

It's important to get a proper medical evaluation as soon as possible, ideally with a physical exam and possibly a chest X-ray to rule out rib fractures or other injuries.

In the meantime:
- Avoid activities that worsen the pain, including running and cross-training.
- Use pain relief as advised by a healthcare professional.
- Practice deep breathing exercises gently to prevent lung complications like pneumonia.

Given the pain and your difficulty with movement, I strongly recommend you see a healthcare provider urgently. Continuing to train without proper healing risks worsening the injury and delaying recovery, which could jeopardize your ability to run the marathon.

This is common in respiratory infections where persistent coughing can cause soreness in the chest muscles and cartilage (costochondritis).

However, chest pain should always be monitored carefully. Since you have no history of smoking and your pain is related to coughing, it is less likely to be cardiac, but if you experience worsening pain, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.

What would my doctor do to diagnose this problem. (ie an internal examination)","Your symptoms of bloating after meals and burning leg pain can have various causes, and while ovarian cancer is a concern to consider, these symptoms alone do not confirm it.

Given your age, weight, and symptoms, your doctor will likely take the following steps to evaluate your condition:

1. **Medical History and Physical Exam:** Your doctor will ask detailed questions about your symptoms, menstrual and reproductive history, and perform a general physical exam.

2. **Pelvic Examination:** An internal pelvic exam will be done to check for any masses, tenderness, or abnormalities in the ovaries, uterus, and surrounding structures.

3. **Imaging Tests:** An ultrasound of the pelvis (transvaginal ultrasound) is commonly used to visualize the ovaries and detect cysts, tumors, or other abnormalities.

4. **Blood Tests:** A CA-125 blood test may be ordered. Elevated levels can be associated with ovarian cancer but can also be elevated in other conditions.

5. **Additional Tests:** Depending on findings, your doctor may order CT scans or refer you to a gynecologic oncologist for further evaluation.

Your leg pain with burning sensation may be related to nerve irritation or circulation issues, which should also be assessed.

**Important:** Many benign conditions can cause bloating and leg pain. It is essential to see your healthcare provider promptly for a thorough evaluation to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

2. **Subsequent intermittent diarrhea and constipation, bloating, and cramps** are characteristic of a functional bowel disorder, most commonly **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**.

3. **Lower abdominal pouch and pressure around the hip bones** may reflect bloating and pelvic discomfort, common in IBS.

4. **Burning abdominal pain after eating and in the morning, radiating to the breastbone** suggests **acid-related upper GI symptoms**, such as **gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**.

5. No sexual history reduces the likelihood of gynecological causes like pelvic inflammatory disease.

6. Menstruation two weeks ago makes menstrual-related symptoms less likely currently.

"CORRECT","True","good day, my name is alexi hernan, i have been seeing changes around my genital area mainly at the intersection where my thigh is and it itches sometimes and when i bathe it burns like when you have a bruise on your elbow. could you help me with knowing what is happening to me?","Good day, Alexi. Based on your description of itching and a burning sensation in the area where your thigh meets your genital region, this could be due to several common conditions such as:

1. **Jock Itch (Tinea Cruris)**: A fungal infection causing itching, redness, and burning in the groin area.
2. **Contact Dermatitis**: Skin irritation from soaps, detergents, or clothing materials.
3. **Intertrigo**: Inflammation caused by skin rubbing together, often worsened by moisture.
4. **Yeast Infection**: Can cause itching and burning, especially if there is moisture and warmth.

To help manage your symptoms:
- Keep the area clean and dry.
- Use a mild, fragrance-free soap.
- Avoid tight clothing.
- Consider an over-the-counter antifungal cream if you suspect jock itch.

However, it is important to see a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, especially if symptoms worsen or persist. If you notice any sores, discharge, or severe pain, seek medical attention promptly.","fungal infection (likely tinea cruris)","WRONG","False","","The symptoms described—changes in the genital area at the junction with the thigh, occasional itching, burning sensation during bathing, and appearance similar to a bruise—are most consistent with **intertrigo**.

**Intertrigo** is an inflammatory condition of skin folds caused by friction, moisture, and sometimes secondary infection. It commonly affects areas like the groin, where skin surfaces rub together. The burning and itching, along with erythema that may look like bruising, fit this diagnosis.

Other considerations could include:
- **Tinea cruris (jock itch)**: a fungal infection causing itching and redness in the groin.
- **Contact dermatitis**: irritation from soaps or hygiene products.
- **Ecchymosis or trauma**: less likely without a history of injury.

However, the combination of location, symptoms, and appearance most strongly suggests **intertrigo**.

**Recommendation:** Clinical examination and possibly fungal culture or KOH prep if fungal infection is suspected. Treatment includes keeping the area dry, using barrier creams, and topical antifungals or mild corticosteroids as appropriate.","fungal infection (likely tinea cruris)","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","True","True","False","False","The symptoms described—changes in the genital area at the junction with the thigh, occasional itching, burning sensation during bathing, and appearance similar to a bruise—are most consistent with **intertrigo**.

"CORRECT","True","I was wondering what a possible elevated alk phos 183 and slightly elevated alt numbers might mean? I have a history of thyroid cancer and I recently had a rt knee medial meniscectomy. Would any of these have something to do with the test results? I had an abdominal sonogram on friday and am awaiting the results. Thank you.","Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 183 (depending on your lab's reference range) and slightly elevated ALT can indicate several possibilities:

1. **Liver or Biliary Issues:** ALP is often elevated in liver or bile duct conditions, such as bile duct obstruction, liver inflammation, or liver metastases. ALT is more specific to liver cell injury.

2. **Bone Healing or Disease:** ALP is also elevated in bone growth or healing. Since you recently had a knee meniscectomy, some elevation could be related to bone remodeling or healing after surgery.

3. **Thyroid Cancer History:** If your thyroid cancer had spread to the liver or bones, it could affect these enzymes, but this is less common.

Your abdominal ultrasound is important to evaluate liver and biliary tract status. Other tests like GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) can help determine if ALP elevation is liver-related.

**Summary:** Your recent knee surgery might contribute to elevated ALP, but liver or biliary causes should be ruled out, especially given your history. Await your ultrasound results and discuss with your doctor for further evaluation and possible additional testing.","Possible bone turnover post-meniscectomy or liver pathology","WRONG","False","","In a patient with a history of thyroid cancer and recent right knee medial meniscectomy, an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 183 (above normal) along with slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) raises concern for possible bone or liver involvement.

Key considerations:

1. **Elevated ALP** can originate from:
   - Bone (e.g., bone metastases, healing fractures, or bone remodeling after surgery)
   - Liver (e.g., cholestasis, liver metastases)

2. **Slightly elevated ALT** suggests mild hepatocellular injury or liver involvement.

3. **History of thyroid cancer**:
   - Thyroid cancer, especially follicular or papillary types, can metastasize to bone and liver.
   - Bone metastases can elevate ALP due to increased osteoblastic activity.
   
4. **Recent knee surgery**:
   - Surgery itself can cause transient elevation in ALP due to bone healing, but this is usually localized and mild.
   - ALT is less likely to be elevated from knee surgery.

5. **Abdominal sonogram pending**:
   - This is likely to evaluate for liver metastases or biliary obstruction.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

- **Bone metastases from thyroid cancer** causing elevated ALP.
- Possible early liver involvement or metastases causing mild ALT elevation.
- Less likely, but possible, transient ALP elevation from bone healing post-meniscectomy.

**Recommendation:**

- Await abdominal sonogram results to assess liver.
- Consider bone scan or further imaging to evaluate for bone metastases.
- Correlate with clinical symptoms (bone pain, weight loss).
- Check other liver function tests and tumor markers.

"CORRECT","True","Hi I have a blister in my gum and was swollen it mad my upper lip hurt with a simple touch my mom told me to rub a cotton with hydrogen peroxide and it just made it whiter and bigger she said it was just the infection but I m worried its something worse now my tooth hurts and it also hurts to talk and open my mouth help please!!!!...","I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. A blister on the gum with swelling, pain in the upper lip, toothache, and difficulty opening your mouth can indicate a dental infection or abscess, which may require prompt treatment.

Here are important steps you should take:

1. **Avoid irritating the area further**: Stop using hydrogen peroxide directly on the blister as it can cause irritation and worsen the lesion.
2. **Maintain oral hygiene**: Gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day to help reduce bacteria.
3. **Pain management**: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce pain and inflammation.
4. **Seek urgent dental care**: Because you have swelling, pain, and difficulty opening your mouth, you should see a dentist as soon as possible. This could be a sign of a spreading infection that may need antibiotics or drainage.
5. **Watch for serious symptoms**: If you develop fever, increased swelling, difficulty breathing or swallowing, go to the emergency room immediately.

Do not delay professional evaluation to prevent complications. If you cannot see a dentist promptly, visit an urgent care center or emergency room.","periodontal abscess","WRONG","False","","The presentation of a blister on the gum with swelling, tenderness of the upper lip, tooth pain, difficulty talking, and difficulty opening the mouth (trismus), along with the blister becoming whiter and larger after hydrogen peroxide application, suggests an **oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection**, specifically **herpetic gingivostomatitis**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Blister on the gum (vesicular lesion typical of HSV)
- Swelling and tenderness
- Tooth pain and difficulty opening the mouth (common in severe oral HSV infections)
- Hydrogen peroxide causing the blister to become whiter and larger is consistent with the fragile vesicles of HSV lesions.

**Important considerations:**
- Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole can sometimes cause gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea.
- Metformin can also cause nausea, especially if taken on an empty stomach or if kidney function is impaired.
- High blood sugar with nausea raises concern for possible diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), both of which require urgent medical attention.

**When to go to the Emergency Department immediately:**
- Persistent nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Difficulty breathing
- Confusion or drowsiness
- Signs of dehydration (dry mouth, dizziness)
- Blood sugar consistently above 250-300 mg/dL despite medication

Impacted or infected wisdom teeth can cause local infection or swelling that might affect your throat and airway, potentially leading to difficulty swallowing and breathing issues. The stiff jaw and neck could indicate spreading infection or inflammation.

While anxiety can cause shortness of breath, the combination of your symptoms—especially difficulty swallowing, stiff neck, and shortness of breath—warrants urgent medical evaluation to rule out serious complications such as an abscess or airway obstruction.

**Recommendation:** Seek prompt medical or dental care immediately, preferably an emergency or urgent care setting, to assess for infection or other complications related to your wisdom teeth.

Turf toe can vary in severity:
- Mild cases may improve with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), along with avoiding activities that worsen the pain.
- More severe cases may require medical evaluation, immobilization, or physical therapy.

Since your pain is strong enough to limit walking and persists throughout the day, I recommend seeing a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. They may perform a physical exam and possibly imaging (like an X-ray) to rule out fractures or more serious injury. Early treatment can help prevent chronic problems and speed recovery.

In the meantime, avoid activities that trigger the pain, apply ice, and consider over-the-counter pain relief if needed. But please get checked by a doctor to ensure proper care.","turf toe","WRONG","False","","The symptoms described—intermittent pain near the bone of a toe triggered by forceful impact during football, with initial intense pain impairing walking followed by mild persistent discomfort—are less typical of turf toe.

**Turf toe** is a sprain of the plantar metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint of the big toe, usually caused by hyperextension (upward bending) of the toe rather than direct impact. It typically presents with pain, swelling, and limited joint movement at the base of the big toe after hyperextension injury.

Given the history of forceful hitting of the ball and localized pain near the toe bone, the most likely diagnosis is:

### **Toe contusion or subungual hematoma (if under the nail) or a possible toe bone (phalanx) contusion/fracture.**

- Direct trauma to the toe bone can cause a contusion or even a fracture.
- Pain triggered by impact and persistent mild discomfort fits this better than turf toe.
- Turf toe usually involves hyperextension injury and joint pain/swelling rather than direct impact pain.

**Recommendation:** Clinical examination and possibly an X-ray to rule out fracture are advised. If swelling, bruising, or deformity is present, urgent evaluation is warranted.

Key points:
- Bloating, abdominal and back pain, and prolonged bleeding could suggest a pelvic or abdominal pathology.
- Frequent urge to defecate and dysuria with stinging suggest irritation or inflammation of the urinary and/or gastrointestinal tract.
- The prolonged menstrual period (about two weeks) is abnormal and may indicate an underlying gynecological issue.

Most likely diagnosis:

Should I be concerned?","It's not uncommon to have throat irritation and a mild cough after general anesthesia with intubation, especially if the breathing tube was in longer than usual. The presence of some phlegm with a small amount of bright red blood can be due to minor irritation or small trauma to the throat or airway during intubation.

However, you should be cautious if you experience any of the following:
- Increasing amount or persistent bright red blood in phlegm
- Difficulty breathing or worsening shortness of breath
- Severe throat pain or swelling
- Fever or signs of infection
- Chest pain

Percocets .. they dont work and even Fentnyal patches all not touching the pain... an opinion would be great.. I dont know what to do..the pain is killing me.. Thank you.","I'm sorry to hear about your ongoing pain. Given your history of emergency surgery for small intestine twist and colon removal with an ileostomy, persistent severe pain on the same side could be due to several possibilities, including:

1. **Adhesions (scar tissue):** Common after abdominal surgeries, adhesions can cause intermittent or constant pain by pulling on tissues or causing partial obstruction.
2. **Nerve pain (neuropathic pain):** Surgery can damage nerves, leading to chronic neuropathic pain that often does not respond well to opioids.
3. **Hernia near the stoma site:** Sometimes hernias develop around the ileostomy, causing pain.
4. **Chronic mesenteric ischemia or intermittent bowel obstruction:** Though imaging may have ruled this out, subtle issues can persist.
5. **Musculoskeletal pain:** From altered posture or abdominal wall strain.

Since imaging and standard pain medications have not helped, I recommend:

- Consulting a **pain specialist** experienced in chronic abdominal and neuropathic pain.
- Considering a trial of **neuropathic pain medications** such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or certain antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline).
- Evaluation by a **surgeon** familiar with stoma complications to rule out hernias or other mechanical causes.
- Possibly a **diagnostic laparoscopy** to assess for adhesions if clinically indicated.
- Exploring **multimodal pain management** including physical therapy, nerve blocks, or psychological support.

Please discuss these options with your healthcare provider to tailor a plan for your pain relief. If pain worsens or new symptoms develop, seek urgent care.","Possible parastomal hernia or neuropathic pain","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is **neuropathic pain due to an abdominal wall nerve injury or neuroma adjacent to the ileostomy site**.

Rationale:
- The patient has a history of major abdominal surgery (colon removal and emergency surgery for small bowel volvulus), which can cause nerve injury.
- Persistent severe pinching pain localized near the ileostomy suggests a localized nerve-related pain rather than visceral or inflammatory pain.
- Multiple imaging studies (CT, MRI) are negative, ruling out structural causes such as abscess, hernia, or recurrence.
- Lack of response to opioids, which are less effective for neuropathic pain, supports a neuropathic mechanism.
- Common causes include nerve entrapment, neuroma formation, or post-surgical nerve damage in the abdominal wall.

Key points:
- DMPA typically causes amenorrhea or irregular spotting early on, but stable bleeding patterns usually develop after prolonged use.
- New spotting after a stable period raises concern for breakthrough bleeding, which can be caused by:
  - Endometrial changes (e.g., atrophy, breakthrough bleeding)
  - Infection or inflammation
  - Hormonal fluctuations or failure of contraception
- Severe night and day sweating (diaphoresis) is not a typical side effect of DMPA and may indicate systemic illness such as infection, thyroid dysfunction, or less commonly, malignancy.

Most likely diagnosis:
- **Breakthrough bleeding due to endometrial instability from DMPA use, possibly triggered by systemic illness or hormonal changes.**
- The severe sweating suggests a systemic cause that may be unrelated or contributing, such as:

"CORRECT","True","My hair is thinning all over the scalp, especially above the sideburns i.e.behind the eye(wherein i ve every bald person has hair on the sides except on the top) so i hope this is not androgenetic alopecia, i ve lost hairs from all over the scalp, the temple hairs have almost gone, my scalp can be seen through the hair, no history of hairloss runs in my family. My dermatoglogist prescribed hair bless tablets, he said that this is due to biotin deficiency. Can biotin deficiency cause hairloss on the entire scalp?","Yes, biotin deficiency can cause diffuse hair thinning and hair loss over the entire scalp, not just specific areas. Biotin (vitamin B7) is important for healthy hair growth, and its deficiency can lead to hair shedding and thinning. However, biotin deficiency severe enough to cause noticeable hair loss is relatively rare.

Your description of diffuse thinning, including loss at the temples and visible scalp, suggests a generalized hair loss pattern rather than the classic androgenetic alopecia pattern, which typically starts with a receding hairline and thinning on the crown but often spares the sides.

Other causes of diffuse hair loss include:

- Telogen effluvium (stress, illness, medications)
- Nutritional deficiencies (iron, zinc, vitamin D)
- Thyroid disorders
- Autoimmune conditions (alopecia areata)
- Scalp infections or inflammation

Since your dermatologist prescribed biotin supplements (""hair bless tablets""), it is reasonable to try them if biotin deficiency is suspected. However, it is important to:

1. Confirm biotin deficiency with blood tests if possible.
2. Evaluate for other causes of diffuse hair loss.
3. Follow up regularly to assess response to treatment.

If hair loss persists or worsens, consider a second opinion or further investigations such as scalp biopsy or hormonal tests.

In summary, biotin deficiency can cause diffuse hair loss, but it is uncommon. Your dermatologist's approach is reasonable, but monitoring and further evaluation may be needed.","Biotin deficiency-related hair loss (possible), other causes not excluded","WRONG","False","","Diffuse hair thinning over the entire scalp, especially involving the temples and sideburns, with visible scalp, suggests a pattern of hair loss that is not typical for biotin deficiency alone.

Key points:
- Biotin deficiency is rare and usually causes more generalized hair loss, often with other symptoms like dermatitis or neurological signs.
- Biotin deficiency-related hair loss is typically diffuse but not specifically localized to temples and sideburns.
- No family history reduces likelihood of androgenetic alopecia but does not exclude it.
- The pattern described (temples and sideburns) is characteristic of **frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA)** or **traction alopecia**, but FFA is more common in postmenopausal women.
- Diffuse thinning with visible scalp and involvement of temples can also be seen in **chronic telogen effluvium** or **alopecia areata incognita**.
- The absence of family history and the pattern suggest **chronic telogen effluvium** or possibly **early female pattern hair loss**.

Most likely diagnosis: **Chronic telogen effluvium** or early female pattern hair loss rather than biotin deficiency.

Biotin deficiency is an uncommon cause of diffuse hair loss and should be confirmed by laboratory testing before attributing hair loss to it.

Recommendation: 
- Check serum biotin levels if deficiency is suspected.
- Consider scalp biopsy if diagnosis remains unclear.
- Evaluate for other causes of diffuse hair loss (thyroid, iron deficiency, autoimmune).
- Androgenetic alopecia can present without family history and should be considered.

I have had trouble with cysts and missed periods occasionally before but nothing like this.","Losing your virginity itself does not directly cause changes in your menstrual cycle. However, hormonal fluctuations, stress, or physical changes related to sexual activity can sometimes affect your periods.

Since your boyfriend used a condom and withdrew before ejaculation, the risk of pregnancy is lower but not zero, as condoms can sometimes fail or pre-ejaculate fluid can contain sperm.

Given your history of cysts and occasional missed periods, these could also be contributing to the changes in your cycle.

To be sure, you should take a pregnancy test if your period is late or abnormal. If irregular bleeding continues or worsens, or if you have other symptoms, consult your healthcare provider for evaluation and possible ultrasound to check for cysts or other issues.","Menstrual irregularity likely due to hormonal imbalance or stress; pregnancy unlikely","WRONG","False","","The patient's history includes first sexual intercourse with condom use and withdrawal, which reduces but does not eliminate the risk of pregnancy. She reports abnormal menstrual bleeding with heavier but shorter periods following intercourse, along with a history of ovarian cysts and occasional missed periods.

Key points to consider:
- Pregnancy is possible despite condom use and withdrawal, especially if any condom failure or pre-ejaculate sperm presence occurred.
- Abnormal bleeding can be due to hormonal fluctuations, early pregnancy (including threatened miscarriage or implantation bleeding), or ovarian cyst-related hormonal disturbances.
- Ovarian cysts can cause irregular cycles and abnormal bleeding.
- The timing of bleeding changes after intercourse raises suspicion for pregnancy-related changes or hormonal imbalance.

Most likely diagnosis:
**Early pregnancy with implantation bleeding or hormonal irregularity related to ovarian cysts causing abnormal uterine bleeding.**

Recommended next steps:
- Perform a urine or serum pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy.
- Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate ovarian cysts and uterine status if pregnancy test is negative.

Since it appears and then disappears, it may be due to contact irritation from the food.

**Recommendations:**
- Stop feeding Cerelac for a few days to see if the redness resolves completely.
- Keep the area clean and dry.
- If you decide to reintroduce, do so in small amounts and watch for any recurrence or worsening of redness.
- If the redness worsens, spreads, or if your baby shows other symptoms like swelling, rash elsewhere, or difficulty feeding, consult your pediatrician promptly.

"CORRECT","True","I went SCUBA diving with a rented regulator (the piece you put in your mouth ) on the 25th. That night I realized my lower left tooth was hurting, much akin to wisdom tooth growth. I woke up yesterday with white and clear bumps on my outer gum that resemble the blisters which show up on skin because of fever blisters. I had to use the same regulator yesterday for my certification and this morning my gum has several small, shallow holes where the blisters burst or were rubbed away by the rubber. It is not swollen but it is tender when pressure is exerted. My teeth do not hurt, but under my chin behind the jaw bone is also tender. There is no swelling to speak of. The dive shop puts rented gear in a tank of Mean Green to disinfect everything before renting it out. I called to ask if they had heard of this situation occurring before and no one seems to know anything about this. Thanks for your help!","Your symptoms—initial tooth pain, followed by white and clear blister-like bumps on the gum that have burst into shallow holes, tenderness without swelling, and tenderness under the jaw—suggest a localized mucosal irritation or infection. Possible causes include:

1. **Mechanical trauma:** The regulator mouthpiece may have caused friction or minor injury to your gum, leading to blistering and ulceration.
2. **Herpetic stomatitis or cold sore outbreak:** The blisters resemble fever blisters, which could be a herpes simplex virus reactivation triggered by stress or irritation.
3. **Chemical irritation or allergic reaction:** Although the dive shop disinfects with Mean Green, this product is not typically used for medical-grade sterilization and could cause mucosal irritation or a mild chemical burn.
4. **Secondary bacterial infection:** The tenderness under the jaw could indicate early lymph node involvement due to local infection.

Recommendations:
- Avoid using the regulator mouthpiece until your gums heal.
- Maintain good oral hygiene with gentle brushing and saline rinses.
- Avoid irritants like spicy or acidic foods.
- If pain or tenderness worsens, swelling develops, or you develop fever, seek prompt dental or medical evaluation.
- Consider seeing a dentist or oral medicine specialist to rule out herpetic infection or other causes.
- For future dives, ensure the equipment is properly sterilized with medical-grade disinfectants.

If symptoms persist beyond a week or worsen, professional evaluation is important to prevent complications.","dental infection with secondary oral mucosal ulcers and possible reactive lymphadenitis","WRONG","False","","The patient's presentation includes:

- Pain in the lower left tooth area after using a rented scuba regulator mouthpiece.
- Development of white and clear blister-like lesions on the outer gum.
- Subsequent shallow ulcerations where blisters ruptured.
- Tenderness of the gum and submandibular (under the chin) area without swelling.
- No tooth pain.
- Exposure to a rented regulator disinfected with Mean Green solution.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

**Chemical mucositis/irritation of the oral mucosa due to contact with a contaminated or improperly rinsed scuba regulator mouthpiece.**

**Rationale:**

- The timing of symptoms immediately after diving and use of the rented regulator suggests a direct cause-effect relationship.
- Mean Green is a cleaning agent that can be irritating or caustic to mucous membranes if residues remain on the mouthpiece.
- The white blister-like lesions and subsequent shallow ulcers are consistent with chemical burns or irritant contact stomatitis.
- Lack of swelling and absence of tooth pain argue against dental abscess or infection.
- Tenderness under the jaw without swelling may reflect regional lymphadenitis or reactive inflammation.
- Fever blisters (herpes simplex virus) typically occur on the lip or keratinized mucosa and are less likely to appear suddenly after exposure to a mouthpiece.
- The lesions' location on the outer gum and their appearance after repeated exposure support a chemical irritant cause rather than infectious.

**Summary:**

The patient most likely has chemical irritation/chemical mucositis of the oral mucosa caused by residual disinfectant or contamination on the rented scuba regulator mouthpiece.

**Recommendations:**

- Avoid further use of the rented regulator.
- Maintain good oral hygiene.
- Use topical oral analgesics or protective gels as needed.
- If lesions worsen or signs of infection develop, seek dental or medical evaluation.
- Inform the dive shop about the issue to ensure proper rinsing and disinfection protocols.

- Tenderness of the gum and submandibular (under the chin) area without swelling.
- No tooth pain.
- Exposure to a rented regulator disinfected with Mean Green solution.

**Most likely diagnosis:**

**Chemical mucositis/irritation of the oral mucosa due to contact with a contaminated or improperly rinsed scuba regulator mouthpiece.**

**Rationale:**

- The timing of symptoms immediately after diving and use of the rented regulator suggests a direct cause-effect relationship.
- Mean Green is a cleaning agent that can be irritating or caustic to mucous membranes if residues remain on the mouthpiece.
- The white blister-like lesions and subsequent shallow ulcers are consistent with chemical burns or irritant contact stomatitis.
- Lack of swelling and absence of tooth pain argue against dental abscess or infection.
- Tenderness under the jaw without swelling may reflect regional lymphadenitis or reactive inflammation.
- Fever blisters (herpes simplex virus) typically occur on the lip or keratinized mucosa and are less likely to appear suddenly after exposure to a mouthpiece.
- The lesions' location on the outer gum and their appearance after repeated exposure support a chemical irritant cause rather than infectious.

**Summary:**

The patient most likely has chemical irritation/chemical mucositis of the oral mucosa caused by residual disinfectant or contamination on the rented scuba regulator mouthpiece.

**Recommendations:**

- Avoid further use of the rented regulator.
- Maintain good oral hygiene.
- Use topical oral analgesics or protective gels as needed.
- If lesions worsen or signs of infection develop, seek dental or medical evaluation.
- Inform the dive shop about the issue to ensure proper rinsing and disinfection protocols.

If symptoms persist beyond 1-2 weeks or worsen, consider evaluation for other causes such as viral stomatitis or allergic reactions.","A patient went scuba diving on the 25th using a rented regulator mouthpiece.

"CORRECT","True","hi doc.]i am suffering from hair thinning and dry hair problem from many years .....i have itchy scalp i have been taking supliments and homoepathic treatment from last year .recently my new homoepath asked me to get tsh test and ultrasound.my thyroid level is 3.06 and there was RT ovarian cyst in my ultrasound reports , she said that my hairfall nad body acnes are due to this only !i want to ask that is there any other home remedies or suggestion that i can follow along with my medicines .i seriously want to cure my hair loss and want new growth asap .waiting for your reply sincerely harshita","Hi Harshita,

Thank you for sharing your concerns. Here are some important points regarding your situation:

1. **Thyroid Level (TSH 3.06):**  
   Your TSH level is within the normal reference range (usually 0.4–4.0 mIU/L), so thyroid dysfunction is less likely to be the cause of your hair thinning.

2. **Ovarian Cyst:**  
   A right ovarian cyst can sometimes be associated with hormonal imbalances, especially if it is related to conditions like PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). Hormonal imbalances can contribute to hair thinning, acne, and other symptoms.

3. **Hair Thinning and Itchy Scalp:**  
   These can be caused by multiple factors including hormonal changes, scalp conditions (like dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis), nutritional deficiencies, stress, or underlying medical issues.

### Suggestions for You:

- **Continue Medical Follow-up:**  
  Follow your doctor’s advice regarding treatment for the ovarian cyst and any hormonal evaluation. If PCOS or other hormonal issues are diagnosed, specific treatment can help improve hair growth.

- **Scalp Care:**  
  Use gentle, sulfate-free shampoos and avoid harsh chemical treatments. Consider medicated shampoos if dandruff or scalp inflammation is present.

- **Nutrition:**  
  Ensure a balanced diet rich in protein, iron, zinc, biotin, and vitamins (especially vitamin D and B-complex). Sometimes supplements can help if you have deficiencies.

- **Home Remedies:**  
  - Apply aloe vera gel to soothe the scalp and reduce itching.  
  - Coconut oil or castor oil massages can improve scalp health and hair strength.  
  - Avoid excessive heat styling and tight hairstyles.

- **Stress Management:**  
  Practice relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or regular exercise, as stress can worsen hair loss.

- **Dermatologist Consultation:**  
  If hair loss persists, consider seeing a dermatologist for further evaluation. They may recommend treatments like minoxidil or other therapies.

### Important:  
Avoid self-medicating or stopping prescribed treatments without consulting your healthcare provider.

If you want, I can help you with a detailed plan or answer any specific questions you have.

Wishing you the best for your hair health!","hair thinning and hair loss (not due to thyroid or ovarian cyst)","WRONG","False","","Key points from the case:
- Hair thinning, dry hair, itchy scalp (chronic symptoms)
- TSH level: 3.06 (within or slightly upper normal range, depending on lab reference)
- Right ovarian cyst on ultrasound
- Body acne present
- Homeopath attributes symptoms to ovarian cyst

Analysis:
1. Hair thinning, dry hair, and itchy scalp are common in hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism. A TSH of 3.06 is often considered within normal limits but may be borderline high depending on the lab and clinical context. Mild hypothyroidism can cause these symptoms.

2. Ovarian cysts are common and often incidental findings. Most simple cysts do not cause systemic symptoms like hair loss or acne.

3. Body acne and hair loss together raise suspicion for androgen excess, such as in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS can cause ovarian cysts, acne, and hair thinning (often androgenic alopecia).

4. The homeopathic attribution of symptoms to the cyst is not supported by typical medical evidence.

Most likely diagnosis:
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), causing androgen excess leading to acne and hair thinning.
- The ovarian cyst seen on ultrasound may be a follicular cyst or multiple cysts consistent with PCOS.
- The TSH is borderline normal; hypothyroidism is less likely the primary cause.

Recommendation:
- Evaluate for PCOS with clinical criteria (oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound).
- Check serum androgens (testosterone, DHEAS), LH/FSH ratio.

"CORRECT","True","I have had lower back pain which may have been caused by heavy lifting for over 2 months now. It is getting more and more severe. It hurts to sit and to bend over. I also think it has caused constipation. I was prescribed Naproxen for the pain and cycloprine as a muscle relaxant.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated so that I could take some knowledge with me to the doctor next time.","Your symptoms of worsening lower back pain over 2 months, difficulty sitting and bending, and associated constipation are concerning and warrant thorough evaluation. Possible causes include:

1. **Muscle strain or ligament injury** from heavy lifting, which is common but usually improves with time and treatment.
2. **Disc herniation or nerve compression** (e.g., sciatica), which can cause severe pain and sometimes bowel symptoms if nerves are affected.
3. **Spinal stenosis or other structural issues** such as spondylolisthesis or vertebral fractures.
4. **Serious conditions** like cauda equina syndrome, which is a medical emergency characterized by severe back pain, bowel/bladder dysfunction, and leg weakness.

Given your constipation and worsening pain despite medication, it is important to seek urgent medical attention. You should:

- Request a detailed neurological exam to check for leg weakness, numbness, or reflex changes.
- Ask for imaging studies such as an MRI of the lumbar spine to evaluate discs, nerves, and spinal canal.
- Discuss the possibility of referral to a spine specialist or neurologist.
- If you develop new symptoms like numbness in the groin area, loss of bladder or bowel control, or severe leg weakness, go to the emergency room immediately.

In the meantime, avoid heavy lifting and activities that worsen pain. Continue pain management as advised but do not delay further evaluation.

"CORRECT","True","Dear Sir/Madame, I have a question for you. Namely, a week after I had unprotected sex, I started having pregnancy symptoms . First it started with headache, lower backpain , abdominal cramps (slightly similar to menstrual cramps), and very sore breasts (something I have never had before). After few days, I started having extreme fatique, lightheaded, dizziness , urinating more frequently, white creamy discharge, occassional pinching on my lower abdominal area, and acne all over my cheeks. I got my menstrual period exactly after 4 weeks, but it was much lighter than usual and I had normal bleeding for one night, where as the rest was coming and going through out the day and much lighter. After exactly 4 weeks I again got my period with the same pattern (I never get my period exactly 28 days apart two times in a row). I did quantative analysis of Beta ChatDoctor in what would have been 6th week gestatonial age (if I were pregnant ), and my B ChatDoctor was less than 1. In the meanwhile, my lower abdomen keeps getting bigger (I am very slender, and never have I had such bloated lower abdomen--my friends keep asking me if I am pregnant, since my lower abdomen is shaped in such a way that it looks as if I am pregnant; it is mainly bloated in the area where the uterus is located). Thus, my question (after such a long story) is: Is there any way I could be pregnant, given my B ChatDoctor results? And finally, I forgot to mention, I also did blood chemical analysis and the results showed that I have iron deficiency, but my red blood cells and hemoglobin were perfectly fine, and I had slight decrease in tryglicerides. Thank you for your answer! Kind Regards, Heather","Dear Heather,

Thank you for your detailed description. Based on the information you provided:

1. **Pregnancy Test (Beta hCG) Result:**  
A quantitative Beta hCG level less than 1 at what would be the 6th week of gestation strongly indicates that you are not pregnant. In early pregnancy, Beta hCG levels are typically elevated and measurable well above 1.

2. **Menstrual Bleeding:**  
Having two periods exactly 4 weeks apart, even if lighter and irregular, also suggests that you are not pregnant. Implantation bleeding or early pregnancy bleeding is usually not as regular or consistent as menstrual periods.

3. **Symptoms:**  
Many of your symptoms (headache, back pain, abdominal cramps, breast tenderness, fatigue, frequent urination, discharge, acne, bloating) can be caused by hormonal fluctuations, stress, or other medical conditions such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), hormonal imbalances, or gastrointestinal issues.

4. **Bloating and Abdominal Enlargement:**  
Bloating and a visibly enlarged lower abdomen can be due to gastrointestinal causes (e.g., gas, constipation), ovarian cysts, or other gynecological conditions. Given your slender build, this may be more noticeable.

5. **Iron Deficiency:**  
Iron deficiency without anemia can cause fatigue and other symptoms. It is good that your hemoglobin and red blood cells are normal, but you should address the iron deficiency with your healthcare provider.

**Summary:**  
- Your very low Beta hCG level effectively rules out pregnancy.  
- Your symptoms and bleeding pattern are not typical of pregnancy.  
- The bloating and abdominal enlargement should be evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out other causes such as ovarian cysts or gastrointestinal issues.  
- Iron deficiency should be managed appropriately.

**Recommendation:**  
Please consult your healthcare provider or a gynecologist for a thorough physical examination and possibly an ultrasound to evaluate your abdominal bloating and rule out other conditions. They can also help manage your iron deficiency and investigate other causes of your symptoms.

If you have any further questions or new symptoms, do not hesitate to seek medical advice.

Kind regards,  
[Your Medical Assistant]","Pregnancy ruled out; symptoms likely related to iron deficiency","WRONG","False","","The patient's symptoms include:

- Early post-coital symptoms (headache, lower back pain, abdominal cramps, sore breasts)
- Subsequent extreme fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness, increased urination, white creamy vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pinching, and facial acne
- Two menstrual periods 4 weeks apart but unusually light and intermittent bleeding
- Negative quantitative beta-hCG at 6 weeks gestational age (<1)
- Progressive lower abdominal bloating resembling pregnancy despite slender habitus
- Iron deficiency without anemia, slight decrease in triglycerides

**Key points to consider:**

1. **Negative pregnancy test at 6 weeks gestational age** with symptoms resembling early pregnancy (breast tenderness, fatigue, increased urination) and abdominal bloating suggests pregnancy is unlikely.

2. **Two menstrual periods 4 weeks apart but lighter and intermittent**—this suggests some hormonal irregularity or anovulatory cycles.

3. **White creamy vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pinching**—could indicate vaginal or cervical irritation or infection.

4. **Iron deficiency without anemia**—may be due to mild chronic blood loss or nutritional deficiency.

5. **Lower abdominal bloating resembling pregnancy** in a slender woman—could be due to ovarian cysts or other pelvic masses.

6. **Facial acne and hormonal symptoms**—suggest hormonal imbalance.

### Differential diagnosis:

- **Early pregnancy with false negative beta-hCG**: Unlikely given very low beta-hCG at 6 weeks gestational age.

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Usually beta-hCG positive; also would present with more severe pain and possibly bleeding.

- **Hormonal imbalance (e.g., PCOS)**: Acne, irregular bleeding, and ovarian cysts causing bloating fit well.

- **Ovarian cyst or functional cyst**: Can cause bloating, abdominal cramps, and hormonal symptoms.

- **Premenstrual syndrome or luteal phase defect**: Could cause breast tenderness, cramps, and light bleeding.

- **Infection (e.g., candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis)**: White creamy discharge fits candidiasis, but does not explain all symptoms.

The thought of being around people, especially groups of any size, sends my mind buzzing and my heart racing. I am experiencing more often pain across my lower back, sometimes it is nothing more than a twinge and other times is sharp and breath stealing. I suffer from acute prolonged pain in my right arm where I broke when I was a child. My appetite leaves much to be desired, usually eating once a day, and not very well when I do. I have headaches that last for days that make me have a sick feeling in my stomach and even more sensitive to light than normal. I have to force myself to take Tylenol for any reason. I do not do drugs or drink and am feeling at the end of my rope. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. Your symptoms—extreme mood lows, irritability, difficulty sleeping, social anxiety, chronic pain, poor appetite, and prolonged headaches—are serious and suggest you may be experiencing a combination of depression, anxiety, and possibly chronic pain syndrome. These conditions often overlap and can significantly impact your quality of life.

Here are some steps you can consider:

1. **Seek Medical Help:** Even if finances are a concern, look for community health clinics or mental health services that offer sliding scale fees or free counseling. Many areas have resources for low-cost or no-cost care.

2. **Talk to a Trusted Person:** Sharing your feelings with a close friend or family member can provide emotional support and help you take the first step toward professional help.

3. **Emergency Help:** If you ever feel overwhelmed to the point of thinking about self-harm or suicide, please seek emergency help immediately by calling a crisis hotline or going to the nearest emergency room.

4. **Pain and Headache Management:** Chronic pain and headaches need evaluation by a healthcare provider to rule out underlying causes and to develop a treatment plan.

5. **Lifestyle:** Try to maintain a routine with small, manageable goals like eating regular meals, gentle physical activity, and sleep hygiene practices.

Your feelings are valid, and help is available. If you want, I can provide information on resources or ways to find affordable care in your area.","depression","CORRECT","True","","The patient's symptoms include:

- Extreme mood lows with frequent crying over minor triggers and increased irritability
- Difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, with persistent tiredness
- Anxiety in social situations with palpitations (suggestive of social anxiety)

For recurrent mouth ulcers lasting this long, you should consider consulting an oral medicine specialist or an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor. A dentist can also evaluate for any local causes, but if ulcers are frequent and persistent, an oral medicine specialist or ENT can assess for underlying systemic issues or other causes. Additionally, a general physician (GP) can help evaluate for nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune conditions, or infections that might be causing the ulcers. 

In summary:
- Start with a GP for initial evaluation and blood tests.
- Then see a dentist or oral medicine specialist for detailed oral examination.
- ENT specialist if needed for further assessment.

"CORRECT","True","Hi I have two problems which are annoying me, I have convex curve in my back, I do a lot of exercise and I have tried doing yoga , do you know of any ways I can widen my shoulders and straighten my spine? My second problem is I have a permeant blocked nose , my face has swollen all over, my eyes look really small. I hope you can help thanks Aubrey ps I breath through my mouth when sleeping. I have tried breathing through my nose,but if makes me feel like I am suffocating?","Hi Aubrey,

1. **Convex curve in your back (likely kyphosis) and shoulder widening:**
   - To help straighten your spine and improve posture, focus on exercises that strengthen your upper back muscles (rhomboids, trapezius) and stretch the chest muscles. Examples include rows, reverse flys, and thoracic extension stretches.
   - Yoga poses like Cobra, Bridge, and Cat-Cow can improve spinal flexibility and posture.
   - Widening shoulders is mostly influenced by genetics and bone structure, but building deltoid and upper back muscles through strength training can improve shoulder appearance.
   - Consider consulting a physical therapist or orthopedic specialist for personalized assessment and exercises, especially if the curve is pronounced or causing pain.

2. **Permanent blocked nose, facial swelling, small eyes, and mouth breathing:**
   - Chronic nasal blockage and facial swelling suggest possible chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps, or allergic rhinitis.
   - Mouth breathing during sleep often results from nasal obstruction and can worsen symptoms.
   - You should see an ENT (ear, nose, throat) specialist for a thorough evaluation, which may include nasal endoscopy or imaging.
   - Treatment may involve medications (nasal steroids, antihistamines), allergy management, or possibly surgery to clear nasal passages.
   - Avoid irritants, use saline nasal sprays, and consider humidifiers to ease nasal congestion.

**Important:** Since you have facial swelling and persistent nasal blockage, please seek medical evaluation promptly to rule out infections or other serious conditions.

If you want, I can help you prepare questions for your doctor or suggest specific exercises.","likely postural kyphosis","WRONG","False","","The combination of symptoms suggests the following:

- **Convex curvature of the back**: This likely refers to **kyphosis** (excessive outward curvature of the thoracic spine).
- **Permanently blocked nose, facial swelling, periorbital puffiness, small-appearing eyes**: These signs point toward **chronic nasal obstruction** and possible **chronic sinus or allergic issues**.
- **Mouth breathing during sleep and sensation of suffocation when trying to breathe through the nose**: Indicates significant nasal airway obstruction.

Putting these together, the most likely diagnosis is **chronic nasal obstruction due to chronic rhinosinusitis or allergic rhinitis with associated postural changes (kyphosis)** possibly worsened by chronic mouth breathing and poor sleep quality.

Additionally, the facial swelling and periorbital puffiness could be related to **chronic sinus disease** or **allergic edema**.

**Key points:**
- The kyphosis may be postural and related to chronic mouth breathing and poor posture.
- The nasal obstruction is causing mouth breathing and sleep-related breathing difficulties.
- The facial swelling and periorbital puffiness suggest chronic inflammation or allergic reaction.

**Recommendations:**
- ENT evaluation for nasal obstruction (e.g., nasal endoscopy, imaging).
- Allergy testing and management if allergic rhinitis is suspected.
- Postural correction exercises and possibly physical therapy for kyphosis.
- Consider sleep study if sleep apnea is suspected due to mouth breathing and suffocation sensation.

"CORRECT","True","My brother began acting strange about 6 years ago. It started out with him thinking that people were after him and has progressed so much that he is completely antisocial, doesnt work, he has been Baker Acted 2 times for a suicidal threat and attempt, he thinks the government is after him, thinks there are speakers hidden in his furniture, we have caught him chanting (not in any real language) and writing strange non-sensical notes. He has false memories of when we were children. He believes doctors are trying to control him and drug him. Our family has tried to get him to seek therapy and/or drug treatment, but he refuses. Over the past couple of years, the irises of his eyes have darkened and now they are almost black. I cant find any reason for this...he has not been on any long term drug therapy. I also cannot find a way to get help for my brother as he is an adult (in his 30s) and he refuses care. We live in Florida and even when he was Baker Acted, the doctors and nurses would not even listen to our accounts of what had been going on with him because he is an adult, and he was released after 72 hours because he told the doctors he was fine, even though he wasnt. He lived with our father for a couple years, and rarely came out of his bedroom. Now he has decided our father is trying to kill him and is moving back in with our mom. He is 32 years old, 6 feet tall, and about 180 pounds. He has no medical issues (other than this). Is there anything we can do? Is there any information you can share? Thank you.","I'm very sorry to hear about your brother's situation. Based on your description, your brother is exhibiting symptoms consistent with a serious psychiatric disorder, most likely a form of schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder. His paranoid delusions (believing people and the government are after him), auditory hallucinations (chanting nonsensical language), disorganized thinking (writing nonsensical notes), and social withdrawal are hallmark features of such conditions.

The darkening of his irises is unusual and not typically associated with psychiatric illness. Possible causes include:

- **Physiological changes:** Some people naturally have darkening irises over time, but this is usually subtle.
- **Medication side effects:** Certain drugs (e.g., prostaglandin analogs for glaucoma) can darken the iris, but you mentioned no long-term drug use.
- **Medical conditions:** Conditions like Horner's syndrome or pigmentary glaucoma can cause iris changes, but these usually have other symptoms.
- **Other causes:** Rarely, systemic illnesses or metabolic disorders can affect eye color.

Given the psychiatric symptoms and eye changes, a thorough medical and psychiatric evaluation is essential to rule out underlying neurological or systemic causes.

### What you can do:

1. **Encourage voluntary evaluation:** Continue to encourage your brother to see a psychiatrist or mental health professional. Sometimes framing it as a general health check-up or eye exam may be less threatening.

2. **Involve a trusted healthcare provider:** If he has a primary care doctor, try to engage them to help coordinate care.

3. **Legal options in Florida:** Since he is an adult and refuses care, involuntary treatment is challenging but possible under Florida's Baker Act if he is deemed a danger to himself or others or unable to care for himself. You can:
   - Contact the local mental health crisis team or law enforcement if he poses an immediate risk.
   - Provide detailed documentation of his behavior and history to support the need for involuntary evaluation.
   - Consult with a mental health attorney or advocate familiar with Florida laws for guidance.

4. **Family support:** Continue to provide emotional support and avoid confrontation. Educate yourself about psychotic disorders to better understand his experience.

5. **Eye evaluation:** Encourage an ophthalmologist visit to assess the iris changes and rule out medical causes.

### Summary:
Your brother likely has a serious psychiatric illness requiring professional treatment. The darkening iris is unusual and warrants medical evaluation. Involuntary treatment is difficult but possible if he is a danger to himself or others. Contacting mental health crisis services and legal consultation in Florida may help.

If you need, I can provide resources for mental health crisis teams or legal aid in Florida. Please let me know.","paranoid schizophrenia (psychotic disorder)","WRONG","False","","The key features in this case are:

- Progressive psychiatric symptoms over 6 years, starting with paranoid delusions and evolving into complex persecutory beliefs.
- Antisocial behavior, unemployment, incoherent speech (chanting), nonsensical writing, and false memories.
- Multiple hospitalizations for suicidal threats/attempts.
- Refusal of psychiatric treatment and distrust of doctors.
- Notably, **darkening of the irises to nearly black over time**, without medication or known medical cause.

The psychiatric symptoms strongly suggest a chronic psychotic disorder, most consistent with **schizophrenia** or a related psychotic disorder.

However, the **progressive darkening of the irises** is a very unusual and important clue. This is not typical in schizophrenia or most primary psychiatric disorders.

One medical condition that can cause both psychiatric symptoms and iris darkening is **Wilson disease** (hepatolenticular degeneration):

- Wilson disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism.
- It can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms including psychosis, personality changes, cognitive decline.
- It causes **Kayser-Fleischer rings**—copper deposits in Descemet's membrane of the cornea, which appear as a brownish or greenish ring at the iris margin, sometimes making the iris appear darker.
- Psychiatric symptoms can precede neurological signs.
- It often presents in young adults.
- Diagnosis is by serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper, slit-lamp exam for Kayser-Fleischer rings, and liver studies.

Given the progressive psychiatric symptoms, refusal of treatment, and especially the progressive darkening of the irises (likely Kayser-Fleischer rings), **Wilson disease** is the most likely diagnosis.

- The electric shock sensation can be nerve irritation or sudden muscle fiber injury.
- Pain, tenderness, swelling, and difficulty using the leg may follow.

Recommendations:
- Rest and avoid activities that worsen pain.

Night paralysis (sleep paralysis) can be frightening but is often benign. However, the additional symptoms you describe—cold sweats, quivering chin, feeling hot but cool to touch, and light-headedness—warrant careful attention.

Here’s what you should do:

1. **Seek medical evaluation promptly:** These symptoms could indicate an underlying issue such as anxiety, a neurological condition, or other medical problems that need assessment.

2. **Keep a symptom diary:** Note the frequency, duration, and any triggers for the night paralysis and associated symptoms.

3. **Ensure good sleep hygiene:** Regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and heavy meals before bed, and a calm bedtime routine.

4. **If symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear (e.g., difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion), seek emergency care immediately.**

The symptoms you describe—yellowish urine, light-colored stool, and slight yellowing of the eyes—are typical signs of jaundice. The need for bed rest and the duration depend on the underlying cause of jaundice (e.g., viral hepatitis, bile duct obstruction, hemolysis).

If your doctor has recommended 3 weeks of bed rest, it is likely based on their assessment of your condition and the cause of jaundice. Generally, rest helps your liver recover, especially if the cause is viral hepatitis or another self-limiting condition.

However, it is important to:

- Follow your doctor’s advice closely.
- Monitor for any new or worsening symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, fever, worsening jaundice).
- Attend follow-up appointments and repeat blood tests to track bilirubin and liver function.

While it may not always indicate a life-threatening condition, chest pain can be a sign of cardiac issues that require prompt evaluation.

You should seek emergency medical care immediately if he has any of the following:
- Severe or worsening chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness or fainting
- Pain radiating to the arm, neck, or jaw
- Sweating or nausea

If he has none of these symptoms and the chest pain is mild and stable, you can contact his doctor promptly for advice.

"CORRECT","True","Hi,I am having a problem from the past few days, that when I burshing my teeth in the morning and then gargling a small amount of blood comes out. But it shows only in the morning.I usually smokes a 3-4 cigrattes day. Please help me out to confirm which medical test I used to go for. Any precautions I have to follow.Thanks","Bleeding gums in the morning, especially when brushing or gargling, can be a sign of gum inflammation or early gum disease (gingivitis). Smoking can worsen gum health and delay healing.

**Recommended steps:**

1. **Medical/Dental tests:**
   - Visit a dentist for a thorough oral examination.
   - Dental X-rays may be done to check bone health around teeth.
   - Periodontal probing to assess gum pocket depths.

2. **Precautions:**
   - Improve oral hygiene: brush twice daily with a soft-bristled toothbrush, floss daily.
   - Use an antiseptic mouthwash.
   - Avoid smoking or reduce smoking as it impairs gum healing.
   - Maintain a balanced diet rich in vitamins, especially vitamin C.

If bleeding persists or worsens, or if you experience pain or swelling, see a dentist promptly. Early treatment can prevent progression to more serious gum disease.","gingivitis and periodontitis","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is **gingivitis**.

Explanation:
- Bleeding in saliva after brushing, especially in the morning, commonly indicates inflammation of the gums.
- Gingivitis causes gum bleeding due to plaque accumulation and irritation.
- Smoking can contribute to gum disease by impairing gum tissue healing and immune response.
- The absence of bleeding at other times and the mild smoking history support early gum inflammation rather than more severe periodontal disease.

Your symptoms of sudden, intense lower left back pain that worsens with movement could be due to several causes, including:

- Muscle strain or ligament injury
- Kidney issues such as infection or stones (especially with diabetes)
- Sciatic nerve irritation
- Other spinal problems like a herniated disc

Given the severity and difficulty walking or bending, and your diabetes (which can increase risk of infections), you should seek urgent medical evaluation. Please go to the emergency room or see your healthcare provider promptly for:

- Physical examination
- Urine tests to check for kidney infection or stones
- Imaging (like X-ray or ultrasound) if needed
- Pain management and appropriate treatment

Do not delay, as some causes require urgent care. If you develop fever, chills, blood in urine, or worsening symptoms, seek emergency care immediately.","acute back sprain","CORRECT","True","","The most likely diagnosis is **acute lumbar muscle strain or lumbar facet joint injury**.

- Sudden onset of severe localized pain in the lower back, especially after movement (getting out of bed), is typical of a musculoskeletal cause such as muscle strain or facet joint irritation.
- The pain is localized to the back bend area, which is less typical for kidney pain (usually flank or costovertebral angle) or sciatic nerve pain (which radiates down the leg).
- The intensity impairing walking and bending supports a significant musculoskeletal injury.
- Diabetes is a relevant comorbidity but does not directly suggest kidney pain here without other signs (e.g., fever, urinary symptoms).

Thank you very much!","Your symptoms—prolonged fever, vomiting, loss of taste, a palpable small lump in the lower right abdomen, and yellowing of the whites of your eyes (jaundice)—are concerning and suggest a serious condition that needs prompt medical evaluation.

Possible causes include:
- Appendicitis (due to the lump and lower right abdominal pain)
- Liver or gallbladder issues (jaundice indicates liver involvement)
- Infection such as hepatitis or another systemic infection

You should seek immediate medical attention to get a thorough examination, blood tests, and imaging studies. Do not delay, as some of these conditions can worsen quickly.

- Vomiting
- Loss of taste
- Sensation of fever localized in the lower right abdomen near the umbilicus every night
- Palpable small mass in the lower right abdomen near the umbilicus
- Yellow discoloration of the sclerae (jaundice)

**Analysis:**

1. **Fever, vomiting, and localized abdominal mass near the umbilicus (lower right abdomen):**

I sleep more often now then before and have stopped smoking 11 days ago.mi was taking zyBan. But decided to stay off it. I have been suffering by hypertension for two years now and still find the need to monitor my pressure as it has increased to 150/110 without reason.. Await your reply","Thank you for the detailed information. Here is an assessment based on your data:

1. **Current Blood Pressure and Pulse:**  
- Your current BP of 123/86 mmHg is within a controlled range, though the diastolic (86) is slightly elevated but acceptable.  
- Pulse of 109 bpm is elevated (tachycardia), which may be due to various factors including medication effects, anxiety, or other causes.

2. **Hypertension History and Medication:**  
- You have hypertension for 2 years and are on multiple antihypertensives: Ramipril (ACE inhibitor), Hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic), and Amlodipine (calcium channel blocker).  
- Despite this, you experienced a spike to 150/110 mmHg, which is concerning and warrants close monitoring.

3. **Other Factors:**  
- You recently quit smoking 11 days ago, which is excellent for cardiovascular health but can sometimes cause temporary changes in heart rate and blood pressure.  
- Zyban (bupropion) discontinuation may also affect your mood and autonomic system temporarily.  
- Increased sleep may be related to medication side effects, lifestyle changes, or other health issues.

4. **Recommendations:**  
- Continue regular BP monitoring, ideally multiple times a day, and keep a log to share with your healthcare provider.  
- Elevated pulse rate should be evaluated; consider factors like anxiety, dehydration, or medication side effects.  
- Ensure adequate hydration, especially living in a warm climate.  
- Discuss with your doctor the recent BP spikes and pulse elevation; medication adjustment or further evaluation (e.g., ECG, labs) may be needed.  
- Maintain your healthy diet and exercise routine.  
- Avoid abrupt medication changes without medical advice.

If you experience symptoms like chest pain, severe headache, dizziness, or shortness of breath, seek emergency care immediately.

Please consult your healthcare provider promptly to review your medications and overall management.","uncontrolled hypertension","WRONG","False","","Key points from the case:
- 53-year-old male with hypertension on multiple antihypertensives (ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine)
- Also on citalopram (an SSRI) and oxycodone for knee pain
- Recently quit smoking 11 days ago after stopping Zyban (bupropion)
- Reports episodes of elevated BP (up to 150/110 mmHg) despite good control otherwise (current BP 123/86)
- Pulse is elevated at 109 bpm (tachycardia)
- Increased sleepiness
- Lives in a warm region (Costa Rica)
- No other clear cause for BP spikes

Possible considerations:
1. **Withdrawal effects from smoking cessation and stopping Zyban**: Nicotine withdrawal can cause sympathetic overactivity, leading to transient hypertension and tachycardia. Bupropion withdrawal may also contribute to mood and autonomic symptoms.
2. **Medication side effects or interactions**: Citalopram can increase heart rate; oxycodone can cause sedation but less likely to cause hypertension.
3. **White coat or labile hypertension**: Episodes of elevated BP with otherwise controlled readings.
4. **Secondary causes of hypertension**: Less likely given no other symptoms or signs.
5. **Sleep disturbances or sleep apnea**: Increased sleepiness could suggest sleep apnea, which can cause labile hypertension and tachycardia.

Most likely diagnosis:
- **Sympathetic overactivity related to recent smoking cessation and Zyban discontinuation causing labile hypertension and tachycardia.**

This explains the episodic BP spikes, elevated pulse, and increased sleepiness (possibly withdrawal fatigue). The patient’s antihypertensive regimen is otherwise adequate.

Recommendation:
- Monitor BP and pulse regularly
- Support smoking cessation with non-pharmacologic measures or alternative therapies if needed
- Evaluate for sleep apnea if symptoms persist
- Reassure patient that these symptoms often improve over weeks after quitting smoking

I am worried I might have shingles again? Thank you for ay advice you can offer.","Your symptoms of a red, itchy rash with red marks from scratching, starting as bumpy blisters between your fingers and now spreading, could be due to several causes. Since antihistamines have not helped and the rash is widespread, it is less likely to be a simple allergic reaction to washing powder.

Shingles typically causes a painful, localized rash in a single dermatome (one side of the body), often with blisters, rather than a widespread rash. Your description of blisters starting between fingers and spreading suggests a possibility of scabies (a contagious mite infestation), which causes intense itching and a rash often starting in web spaces of fingers.

Other possibilities include eczema, contact dermatitis, or a viral exanthem.

**Important:** You should see a healthcare provider promptly for an accurate diagnosis and treatment. They may need to examine the rash, possibly take skin scrapings or swabs, and prescribe appropriate treatment such as topical steroids, scabicides (if scabies), or antiviral medication if shingles is suspected.

- Lack of improvement with antihistamines (antihistamines do not treat scabies).
- Shingles typically presents as a painful, unilateral vesicular rash following a dermatomal distribution, not a generalized itchy rash.

Scabies is caused by the mite *Sarcoptes scabiei*, which burrows into the skin, causing intense pruritus and a characteristic rash, often starting in interdigital spaces.

Could not stand up straight and felt nauseous. After one hour the GasX worked and I did numerous huge burps which got rid of it. Nice! Gas kept coming back though at random times daily for the next few days until I went to the doctor. I also have a gallstone and am worried that my symptoms maybe related to that rather than the h pylori. How long does triple therapy take to start symptom relief?

I have diarrhea (started today), original pain in left side waist still, and intermittent gas/bloating. I woke up with gas/indegestion this morning. Thanks.","Your symptoms of gas, bloating, and pain can be related to both H. pylori infection and gallstones, so it's important to consider both.

**Regarding triple therapy for H. pylori:**
- Symptom relief often begins within 1-2 weeks of starting treatment, but some symptoms may persist during therapy.
- The standard triple therapy you are on (amoxicillin 1000 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and omeprazole 20 mg twice daily) is appropriate.
- It is important to complete the full course (usually 10-14 days) even if symptoms improve.

**Your current symptoms:**
- Diarrhea is a common side effect of antibiotics.
- Persistent left side waist pain is less typical for H. pylori and may be related to your gallstone or another cause.
- Severe gas and bloating can be from H. pylori gastritis, antibiotic side effects, or gallbladder issues.

**Recommendations:**
1. Continue your triple therapy as prescribed to ensure eradication of H. pylori.
2. Monitor your symptoms closely. If pain worsens, becomes severe, or you develop fever, jaundice, or vomiting, seek urgent medical care.
3. Follow up with your doctor to evaluate your gallstone, especially if pain is localized to the right upper abdomen or radiates to the back.
4. After completing therapy, your doctor may recommend a breath or stool test to confirm H. pylori eradication.
5. If symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment, further evaluation (e.g., abdominal ultrasound, gastroenterology referral) may be needed to assess gallbladder and other causes.

In summary, continue your current medications, watch for worsening symptoms, and maintain close follow-up with your healthcare provider to clarify the cause and adjust treatment if needed.","Antibiotic side effects (gas, bloating, diarrhea) during H. pylori triple therapy","WRONG","False","","The patient with confirmed H. pylori infection is on appropriate triple therapy but is experiencing ongoing left-sided waist pain, intermittent gas, bloating, and new-onset diarrhea. The initial symptoms of stitch-like left waist pain and painful trapped gas episodes, including a severe episode with nausea and inability to stand upright, are atypical for uncomplicated H. pylori infection or gastritis, which usually cause epigastric pain.

Key points to consider:
- Left side waist pain is not typical for H. pylori-related gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, which usually cause epigastric or right upper quadrant pain.
- The patient has a known gallstone, but gallstone-related pain typically localizes to the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, not the left waist.
- The severe episode with nausea and inability to stand upright suggests a possible acute abdominal event.
- New onset diarrhea during triple therapy could be antibiotic-associated diarrhea or early Clostridioides difficile infection.
- Persistent left waist pain and systemic symptoms raise concern for another pathology such as musculoskeletal pain, renal pathology (e.g., nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis), or colonic pathology (e.g., diverticulitis).

Most likely diagnosis:
- The symptoms are unlikely to be caused by the gallstone or H. pylori infection directly.
- The left waist pain and severe episodes with nausea suggest a possible renal cause such as left-sided nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis.

I live on a small Island so theres not much option. It all started by this tightening of my chest and heart palpitations. I went to the hospital and the doctor told me  it was anxiety. It eventually went away on its own. Then I menstruated twice for 2 moths, so I was sent for blood work and a gynecologist. Pap test and exam was normal, but my blood came back as having a little bit of low iron. The doctor suggested I take iron pills. I didnt take them for a month and ended up back at the hospital for another reason and they took my blood again which showed my iron was still low but had went up a bit without the iron pills. I started the supplements afterwards and went back to the hospital a month later cause my knee swell up a bit and I got a bruise on it as well as other smalls ones on my other leg. They ran another test and said that my everything was normal except my red hemoglobins were a little small. I then went to the clinic and the doctor ordered more tests ( lupus, monopost, rheumatoid arthitis ) cause at this point I was getting aches and pains in my bones and joints as well as a few small bruises on my arms. Everything came back normal except my red blood cells are high and the mono came back positive. I asked the doctor why I tested positive for mono if I have no symptoms and he said I probably had it a long time ago.  He also said that my pains were probably cause of Fibromyalgia and the bruises were just the way my skin is. Also in the course of these few months my gums did bleed a few times when I brushed my teeth, but not recently.  Ive been doing research online and Im really scared I have Leukemia and I feel trapped and dont know what else to do. Please any advice would be appreciated.  Sarah","Hi Sarah,

Thank you for sharing your detailed history. I understand how stressful and confusing this situation must be for you. Based on what you've described:

- Your initial chest tightness and palpitations were attributed to anxiety, which can cause such symptoms.
- You had low iron levels and mild anemia (small red hemoglobin), which improved somewhat with iron supplements.
- You have some joint and bone pains, small bruises, and occasional gum bleeding.
- Tests for autoimmune diseases (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis) and infectious causes (mononucleosis) were mostly normal except for a positive mono antibody, likely from a past infection.
- Your doctors suggested fibromyalgia for the pain and that bruising may be due to skin fragility.

Regarding your concern about leukemia:
- Leukemia usually causes more significant abnormalities in blood counts, such as very low or very high white blood cells, abnormal cells on blood smear, persistent fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and more severe bruising or bleeding.
- Your blood tests have not shown these typical signs.
- The mild anemia and bruising you describe can be explained by other causes like iron deficiency, minor trauma, or benign skin changes.
- Positive mono antibodies indicate past infection, not active disease.

**Advice:**
1. Continue following up with your healthcare providers and take the iron supplements as prescribed.
2. Keep a symptom diary noting any new or worsening symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss, increased bruising, bleeding).
3. If you develop new symptoms or your current symptoms worsen, ask for a hematology referral for further evaluation.
4. Consider discussing your anxiety and stress with a mental health professional, as stress can worsen physical symptoms.
5. Avoid self-diagnosis from online research, as it often increases anxiety without providing accurate answers.

Your current findings do not strongly suggest leukemia, but ongoing monitoring and communication with your doctors are important. If you feel your concerns are not being addressed, seeking a second opinion when possible may help.

Please reach out if you have more questions or new symptoms. You're not alone, and help is available.

Take care,
Assistant","iron deficiency and fibromyalgia","WRONG","False","","Key clinical points:
- 30-year-old woman with episodes of chest tightness and palpitations initially thought to be anxiety.
- Menstrual irregularities (two periods in two months).
- Mild iron deficiency anemia, started on iron with slight improvement.
- Development of knee swelling with bruising, multiple small bruises on limbs.
- Bone and joint aches and pains.
- Occasional gum bleeding in the past.
- Labs: mostly normal autoimmune and infectious workup except elevated RBC count and positive mononucleosis test without symptoms.
- Clinical impression considered fibromyalgia and skin fragility for bruising.
- Patient worried about leukemia.

Analysis:
1. The combination of easy bruising, joint swelling, bone and joint pain, and occasional gum bleeding suggests a bleeding or clotting disorder rather than fibromyalgia or simple skin fragility.
2. Elevated red blood cell count (erythrocytosis) is unusual in this context and may be reactive or lab artifact.
3. Positive mononucleosis test without symptoms is likely incidental.
4. Menstrual irregularities and mild iron deficiency anemia could be related to bleeding.
5. Leukemia typically presents with abnormal blood counts (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis or leukopenia with blasts), which are not reported here.
6. The bruising, joint swelling, and bleeding gums point toward a platelet or coagulation disorder.
7. The presence of joint swelling and bone pain with bruising raises suspicion for a bleeding disorder affecting joints, such as a mild hemophilia or a platelet function disorder.
8. The history of chest tightness and palpitations could be related to anemia or iron deficiency.

Most likely diagnosis:
- **Von Willebrand Disease (VWD)** or another mild bleeding disorder (e.g., platelet function defect).

Rationale:
- VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder.
- It can cause mucocutaneous bleeding (bruising, gum bleeding), menorrhagia (irregular periods), and joint bleeding leading to swelling and pain.
- It may be mild and overlooked initially.
- Normal autoimmune and infectious tests and no blasts on blood smear make leukemia unlikely.
- Fibromyalgia does not cause bruising or bleeding.
- Iron deficiency anemia fits with chronic blood loss from bleeding tendency.

Recommendation:
- Perform specific coagulation studies including von Willebrand factor antigen, ristocetin cofactor activity, factor VIII levels, platelet function tests.
- Review complete blood count with peripheral smear.
- Consider hematology referral.

"CORRECT","True","I have been feeling as my entire chest is being squeezed in and having pains in my left chest also have been feeling light headed. this has been happening for the past 6 months. I have been under moderate to heavy stress is this a heart issue or something else?","Your symptoms of chest squeezing, left-sided chest pain, and lightheadedness, especially persisting for 6 months, are concerning and could indicate a heart-related issue such as angina or other cardiac conditions. However, stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms.

Given the duration and nature of your symptoms, it is important to seek prompt medical evaluation. Please see a healthcare provider as soon as possible for a thorough assessment, which may include:

- Physical examination
- Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Blood tests (e.g., cardiac enzymes)
- Stress testing or imaging if needed

If you experience sudden severe chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, or fainting, seek emergency care immediately. Do not ignore these symptoms.","Possible coronary artery disease or anxiety/stress-related disorder","WRONG","False","","The patient's symptoms of chest squeezing sensation, left-sided chest pain, and lightheadedness, especially with a history of moderate to heavy stress, are most consistent with **angina pectoris**, likely **stable angina** if symptoms have been ongoing for six months without acute worsening.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Chest squeezing and left-sided chest pain are classic angina symptoms.
- Lightheadedness can occur due to decreased cardiac output or transient ischemia.
- Stress is a common trigger for angina due to increased myocardial oxygen demand.

However, other causes such as anxiety-related chest pain or musculoskeletal pain should be considered, but the cardiac origin is most likely given the symptom pattern.

"CORRECT","True","My 15 year old daughter has a lump in her inner thigh, close to her female area.  She has noticed the lump but didnt experience any pain until last night.  The area is red and warm to touch like an infection has set in.What could this be and is there anything to help with the pain?","The lump in your daughter's inner thigh near the groin that has become red, warm, and painful is likely an infected cyst, abscess, or possibly an inflamed lymph node. This suggests an infection has developed.

**What to do:**
- Apply warm compresses to the area several times a day to help reduce pain and promote drainage if it is an abscess.
- Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help with pain and inflammation.
- Keep the area clean and avoid squeezing or trying to drain the lump yourself.

**Important:**
- Because the area is red, warm, and painful, she should see a healthcare provider promptly. She may need antibiotics or a procedure to drain the infection.
- If she develops fever, increasing redness, swelling, or worsening pain, seek medical care urgently.

In summary, this is likely an infected lump requiring medical evaluation and treatment.","infected sebaceous cyst or boil","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is an **infected or abscessed Bartholin gland cyst**.

Explanation:
- Location: Inner thigh near the genital area corresponds to the location of the Bartholin glands (at the posterior aspect of the vaginal introitus).
- Presentation: A lump that was initially painless but became painful with redness and warmth suggests infection or abscess formation.
- Common in reproductive-age females, but can occur in adolescents.

Other possibilities like inguinal hernia or lymphadenopathy are less likely given the signs of localized infection.

Recommendation: Clinical evaluation and possible incision and drainage or antibiotics may be needed.","infected sebaceous cyst or boil","False","False","False","False","False","True","False","False","False","False","False","The most likely diagnosis is an **infected or abscessed Bartholin gland cyst**.

"CORRECT","True","Hi, my husband complained of having blisters on his penis after we have sex. So we went to a lab and they took urine samples and said they found pus cells and we were placed on antibiotics for a week. 3 days ago we had sex and this morning he has a blister again on his penis....what should we do?","The presence of blisters on the penis after sex, along with pus cells in the urine, suggests a possible sexually transmitted infection (STI) or another type of genital infection. Antibiotics may help if the cause is bacterial, but blisters often indicate viral infections such as herpes simplex virus (HSV).

Here are important steps to take:

1. **See a healthcare provider promptly:** A specialist (urologist or infectious disease doctor) can perform a thorough examination and may order specific tests (e.g., swabs from the blister, blood tests for HSV and other STIs).

2. **Avoid sexual contact until diagnosis and treatment:** To prevent transmission to your partner or others.

3. **Complete the prescribed antibiotics:** Even if symptoms improve, but note that antibiotics do not treat viral infections.

4. **Inform your partner:** Both partners may need evaluation and treatment.

5. **Follow-up:** If symptoms persist or worsen, return to the doctor for reassessment.

In summary, your husband should see a healthcare provider urgently for further evaluation and appropriate treatment, as recurrent blisters may indicate herpes or another STI requiring specific management.","recurrent genital ulcers, likely infectious etiology (consider HSV, chlamydia, fungal infection)","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:
- Recurrent penile blisters following sexual intercourse.
- Initial presence of pus cells in urine could indicate secondary bacterial infection or urethritis.
- Lack of response to antibiotics suggests a viral cause rather than bacterial.
- HSV commonly causes painful genital blisters that can recur, especially triggered by sexual activity.

Recommendation:
- Confirm diagnosis with viral culture, PCR, or serology for HSV.
- Initiate antiviral therapy (e.g., acyclovir) rather than antibiotics.
- Counsel about the recurrent nature and transmission prevention.","recurrent genital ulcers, likely infectious etiology (consider HSV, chlamydia, fungal infection)","False","False","False","False","False","True","False","False","False","False","False","The most likely diagnosis is **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection**.

"CORRECT","True","Hi, My 8 months baby girl had fever, difficult to breath from 10 days, i took her to the doctor, after blood test(CBC, CRP) (CRP=14,, and xray, they diagnosed it as Pnuemonia, he gave her Augmantin and coughing medication. the fever went in one day, and she became very good in five days, but we continued her medication as the doctor prescription for total 10 days, on the 10th day, she start having rash in her buttocks, face, then hands, legs even now under her feet. we took her to the doctor again, he did CBC and urine analysis, still WBC 24, HCT 29, he diagonsed this time with HSP, purpura, and gave her predisone. Please i need your advice on this.","Thank you for sharing the detailed history. Here's an overview and advice based on the information:

1. Initial Pneumonia Diagnosis:
- Your baby had pneumonia confirmed by clinical signs, elevated CRP (14), and chest X-ray.
- Treatment with Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate) and cough medicine was appropriate.
- Fever resolved quickly, and clinical improvement was seen by day 5, which is a good response.

2. New Rash and Symptoms After 10 Days:
- Development of rash on buttocks, face, hands, legs, and feet after completing antibiotics is concerning.
- The rash distribution and presence of purpura (purple spots) suggest a vasculitis.
- Elevated WBC (24,000) and low hematocrit (29) indicate ongoing inflammation and possible anemia.
- Diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) by your doctor fits well with the rash pattern and systemic symptoms.

3. About Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP):
- HSP is a small vessel vasculitis common in children, often triggered by infections.
- It causes purpura (non-blanching rash), joint pain, abdominal pain, and sometimes kidney involvement.
- It can follow respiratory infections like pneumonia.
- Treatment is usually supportive; corticosteroids like prednisone are used if symptoms are severe or involve organs.

4. Recommendations:
- Continue following your doctor’s advice and prednisone treatment as prescribed.
- Monitor for any new symptoms: abdominal pain, blood in urine, swelling, or worsening rash.
- Ensure regular follow-up with your pediatrician or pediatric rheumatologist.
- Maintain hydration and nutrition.
- If you notice any breathing difficulty, persistent high fever, or signs of kidney involvement (reduced urine, swelling), seek immediate medical care.

5. Summary:
- Your baby initially had pneumonia, which likely triggered HSP.
- The rash and lab findings support HSP diagnosis.
- Prednisone is appropriate treatment.
- Close monitoring and follow-up are essential.

If you have any concerns or new symptoms, please contact your healthcare provider promptly.","Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) following pneumonia","WRONG","False","","Summary of the case:
- 8-month-old infant with 10 days of fever and respiratory symptoms diagnosed as pneumonia.
- Treated with Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate) and cough medicine.
- Fever resolved quickly, clinical improvement by day 5, completed 10-day antibiotics.
- On day 10, developed a rash starting on buttocks, spreading to face, hands, legs, soles.
- Labs: WBC elevated to 24 (x10^9/L), hematocrit 29%.
- Diagnosed with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) and started on prednisone.

Analysis:
- HSP is a small-vessel vasculitis characterized by palpable purpura (usually on lower extremities and buttocks), arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal involvement.
- It is uncommon in infants under 1 year old.
- The rash in HSP is typically palpable purpura, not just any rash.
- The rash spreading to face, hands, legs, and soles is atypical for HSP.
- The timing of rash onset after antibiotics raises suspicion for a drug reaction.
- Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate) is known to cause hypersensitivity reactions including morbilliform rash and, rarely, more severe reactions.
- The elevated WBC and anemia (Hct 29%) could be due to inflammation or other causes.
- The initial diagnosis of pneumonia was reasonable.
- The new rash after antibiotic completion suggests a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction rather than HSP.
- HSP diagnosis requires palpable purpura and often other systemic signs; no mention of abdominal pain, joint symptoms, or renal involvement.
- Prednisone is used in HSP but also in severe drug reactions.

Most likely diagnosis:
**A drug-induced hypersensitivity rash (likely due to Augmentin) rather than Henoch-Schonlein purpura.**

Recommendation:
- Review the rash characteristics (palpable purpura vs. maculopapular).
- Consider stopping the suspected drug if still ongoing.
- Monitor for systemic involvement.
- If vasculitis is suspected, skin biopsy can help differentiate HSP from drug reaction.

While the risk is lower if ejaculation did not occur inside the vagina, pregnancy is still possible because pre-ejaculate fluid can contain sperm, and sperm can sometimes reach the vagina if it contacts the outer vaginal area. Since you had unprotected sex around the end of your period bleeding, and sperm can survive up to 5 days in the reproductive tract, there is a chance of pregnancy.

If you want to be sure, you can take a pregnancy test if your next period is late or abnormal. For future protection, consider using reliable contraception methods.

- Additional intercourse on February 18th and 19th with ejaculation outside the vagina.
- She is concerned about the possibility of pregnancy.

**Key points:**

1. Ovulation typically occurs around 14 days before the next period, so if her cycle is about 28 days, ovulation would be around day 14 (approximately February 22nd).
2. Sperm can survive up to 5 days in the female reproductive tract.
3. Intercourse on February 17th to 19th is just before the expected ovulation window, so pregnancy is possible if sperm entered the vagina.

Your symptoms could be due to several causes, including:

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** complications such as esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus (a precancerous condition).
- **Infections or inflammation** causing elevated white blood cells.
- **Food allergies or intolerances** causing gastrointestinal symptoms.
- **Other gastrointestinal conditions** like gastritis, ulcers, or even malignancy.

Given your family history and symptoms, further evaluation is warranted. Your doctor may recommend:

- Upper endoscopy (EGD) to visually inspect the esophagus and stomach and take biopsies if needed.
- Additional blood tests or imaging.
- Allergy testing if food allergy is suspected.

Please follow up promptly with your gastroenterologist or primary care provider to discuss these concerns and get appropriate diagnostic testing. Early evaluation is key to ruling out or diagnosing serious conditions like cancer. If you experience worsening pain, weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or vomiting blood, seek urgent medical attention.","Possible mild intestinal infection; persistent acid reflux under evaluation","CORRECT","True","","Given the patient's history and presentation:

- Chronic acid reflux (GERD) increases risk for Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer.
- Intermittent stomach pain and recent loose stools could indicate gastrointestinal inflammation or infection.
- High white blood cell count suggests an inflammatory or infectious process.
- Family history of esophageal and stomach cancer raises concern for malignancy but does not confirm it.
- Food allergy typically causes symptoms like diarrhea but less commonly causes elevated white blood cells or chronic pain.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
The symptoms and lab findings are more consistent with an inflammatory or infectious gastrointestinal condition (e.g., gastritis, gastroenteritis, or possibly Helicobacter pylori infection) rather than cancer or food allergy at this stage. However, given the family history and chronic reflux, further evaluation with endoscopy and biopsy is warranted to rule out malignancy or precancerous changes.

"CORRECT","True","I have a sharp pain in my lower left lung, around what seems to be the perimeter of the lung. It worsens when I lay down on my left side and I cant exhale without pain erupting. Last fall I was diagnosed with Pericardial Catch Syndrome. But now I think it may be something more.","Your symptoms of sharp pain in the lower left lung area that worsens with lying on your left side and with exhalation could be related to several conditions, including:

1. **Pericardial Catch Syndrome (PCS)** – which you were previously diagnosed with, typically causes sharp, localized chest pain that worsens with breathing or movement.
2. **Pleuritis (pleurisy)** – inflammation of the lining around the lungs causing sharp pain that worsens with breathing or lying on the affected side.
3. **Musculoskeletal pain** – such as from a strained muscle or rib injury.
4. **Pulmonary causes** – such as a small pulmonary embolism or pneumonia, though these usually have additional symptoms like shortness of breath, cough, or fever.
5. **Cardiac causes** – less likely given your history, but still important to consider.

Given the worsening pain with breathing and position, and your history, it is important to seek prompt medical evaluation to rule out serious causes like pleuritis, pulmonary embolism, or pericarditis. A healthcare provider may perform a physical exam, chest X-ray, ECG, and possibly blood tests to clarify the diagnosis.

If you develop symptoms like shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or worsening pain, seek emergency care immediately.","pleurisy (pleuritis), possible lung infection","WRONG","False","","The patient's presentation of sharp, pleuritic pain localized to the lower left lung area, worsened by lying on the left side and with exhalation, along with a history of Pericardial Catch Syndrome (PCS), suggests a recurrence or continuation of PCS.

**Key points supporting Pericardial Catch Syndrome:**
- Sharp, localized, pleuritic chest pain often described as ""stitch-like.""
- Pain worsens with deep breathing or changes in position.
- Typically benign and self-limited.
- Commonly affects the left side of the chest.
- History of PCS increases likelihood of recurrence.

"CORRECT","True","I have a rash in the corners of my mouth on the outside. I was going to see the dermatologist  and then it went away, but now is back. This time of year I lick my lips more and was using blistex, but forgot it one day and bought Bee balm with peppermint oil. Quit using all of them and used vaseline.  Now it is back and I was using the bee balm again. I also had hot chocolate with peppermint. Could this be the culprit or could it be psoriasis? I have never had it on my face??","The rash at the corners of your mouth is likely **angular cheilitis** or irritant contact dermatitis rather than psoriasis, especially given the pattern of flare-ups related to lip licking and use of products containing peppermint oil.

Key points:
- Peppermint oil is a known irritant and can cause allergic or irritant contact dermatitis.
- Frequent lip licking can worsen dryness and irritation.
- Angular cheilitis typically presents as redness, cracking, and soreness at the mouth corners.
- Psoriasis on the face is less common and usually has a different appearance (well-defined, scaly plaques).

Your improvement with stopping the lip balms and using plain Vaseline supports irritation as the cause. The peppermint in both the balm and hot chocolate could be triggering or worsening the rash.

**Recommendation:**
- Avoid all products with peppermint or other potential irritants.
- Keep the area moisturized with plain, fragrance-free emollients like Vaseline.
- Avoid licking your lips.
- If the rash persists or worsens, see a dermatologist for evaluation and possible treatment (e.g., topical antifungals if angular cheilitis is fungal, or mild topical steroids if inflammation is significant).

In summary, peppermint oil is the likely culprit rather than psoriasis.","angular cheilitis (multifactorial: nutritional deficiency, infection, irritant/allergic contact)","WRONG","False","","The most likely diagnosis is **irritant or allergic contact cheilitis (perioral dermatitis)** due to **peppermint oil exposure**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:

- Recurrence correlates with use of lip balm containing peppermint oil and ingestion of peppermint-flavored hot chocolate.
- Improvement when all lip products were stopped and use of Vaseline (a non-irritating barrier).
- No prior history of psoriasis and facial psoriasis typically involves other characteristic features and distribution.
- Increased lip licking can exacerbate irritant dermatitis but does not explain the clear link to peppermint exposure.

Peppermint oil is a known irritant and allergen that can cause contact cheilitis. Avoidance of peppermint-containing products is recommended.

"CORRECT","True","I have been suffering from pain for about three years now.  I sometimes have to resort to taking pain killers to manage it.  The pain is located around the lower right side of my neck, down my shoulder and under my right shoulder blade.  I have seen two doctors about it, one is an internist.  They dont seem to know what is causing it and seem to be reluctant to think it is anything but psycological.  The internist, after looking at me for ten minutes, suggested it was localised fibromyalgia.  They also keep thinking I am somehow addicted to the pain killers when I only take half the dosage prescribed 2-3 times a week. I am very confused, frustrated and I dont know what to do. I have tried physical therapy, message therapy, hot or cold pads, resting, exercising.  It seemed to make the paid worse when I attempted them. If you have any suggestions I would be extremely greatful.","I'm sorry to hear about your ongoing pain and frustration. Chronic pain in the lower right neck, shoulder, and under the shoulder blade can have multiple causes, including musculoskeletal issues (like nerve impingement, muscle strain, or cervical spine problems), referred pain from other areas, or less commonly, systemic conditions.

Given that physical therapy and other conservative measures have worsened your pain, and the diagnosis remains unclear, here are some suggestions:

1. **Further Diagnostic Evaluation:**
   - Consider seeing a specialist such as a neurologist or an orthopedic spine specialist for a detailed assessment.
   - Imaging studies like an MRI of the cervical spine and shoulder may help identify nerve compression, disc issues, or soft tissue problems.
   - Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies can assess nerve function if nerve involvement is suspected.

2. **Pain Management Specialist:**
   - A pain specialist can offer a multidisciplinary approach, including medication adjustments, nerve blocks, or other interventions.

3. **Second Opinion:**
   - If you feel your concerns are not being fully addressed, seeking a second or third opinion from specialists experienced in chronic pain or musculoskeletal disorders may be helpful.

4. **Psychological Support:**
   - Chronic pain can have psychological impacts, and sometimes psychological factors can amplify pain perception. A psychologist or psychiatrist specializing in pain management can provide coping strategies without implying the pain is ""all in your head.""

5. **Avoid Self-Medication:**
   - Continue to use pain medications as prescribed and avoid increasing doses without medical advice.

6. **Keep a Pain Diary:**
   - Document your pain intensity, triggers, activities, and medication use. This can help doctors better understand your condition.

If you experience new symptoms like weakness, numbness, severe headaches, fever, or unexplained weight loss, seek immediate medical attention.

Ultimately, persistent pain warrants thorough evaluation and a multidisciplinary approach. Please consider consulting a specialist for further workup and tailored treatment.","Cervical spondylosis (to be ruled out); possible fibromyalgia if imaging is negative","WRONG","False","","The patient's symptoms—chronic, localized pain in the lower right neck extending to the shoulder and under the shoulder blade, lasting three years, with worsening pain after physical therapy and exercise—suggest a neuropathic or musculoskeletal cause rather than fibromyalgia or purely psychological origin.

Key points:
- Pain localized to a specific region (lower right neck, shoulder, under scapula)
- Chronic duration (3 years)
- Worsening with physical therapy and exercise (suggesting mechanical or nerve irritation)
- Intermittent use of painkillers at reduced doses
- No improvement with typical conservative measures

**Most likely diagnosis: Cervical radiculopathy or a nerve entrapment syndrome (e.g., dorsal scapular nerve or long thoracic nerve entrapment).**

Rationale:
- Cervical radiculopathy from nerve root compression (e.g., C5-C6) can cause neck pain radiating to the shoulder and scapular area.
- Nerve entrapment syndromes can cause localized neuropathic pain in the shoulder blade region.
- Fibromyalgia typically causes widespread pain, not localized to one side or region.
- Psychological causes are less likely given the clear anatomical distribution and chronicity.
- Worsening with exercise and physical therapy may indicate mechanical nerve irritation or instability.

**Recommended next steps:**
- Detailed neurological examination focusing on sensory, motor, and reflex changes.
- Imaging studies such as cervical spine MRI to assess for disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, or other structural causes.
- Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies to evaluate nerve function.
- Referral to a neurologist or pain specialist for further evaluation and management.

"CORRECT","True","I have anhidrosis, dry skin, sculiosis and trouble breathing at age 21. Im a female, and I was wondering if any of these things can cause pain in the chest and breathing disorders. A recent blood test for life insurance shows Im okay in all ranges, cholestrol etc...","Your symptoms of anhidrosis (lack of sweating), dry skin, scoliosis, and trouble breathing can be interconnected and may contribute to chest pain and breathing difficulties.

- **Scoliosis**: This spinal curvature can restrict lung expansion and chest wall movement, leading to breathing problems and sometimes chest discomfort or pain.
- **Anhidrosis and dry skin**: These may indicate an underlying autonomic or neurological disorder, which can sometimes affect respiratory function.
- **Breathing trouble and chest pain**: Could be related to mechanical restriction from scoliosis or other causes such as muscle strain, nerve involvement, or less commonly cardiac or pulmonary issues.

Since your blood tests are normal, it reduces the likelihood of metabolic or systemic causes like infection or inflammation.

**Recommendation:**  
You should see a pulmonologist and possibly a neurologist or rheumatologist for a thorough evaluation. Pulmonary function tests, imaging (like chest X-ray or CT), and possibly autonomic testing may be needed to clarify the cause of your symptoms and guide treatment.

Nightfall (nocturnal emissions) is common in young men and often related to hormonal changes or stress. However, persistent nightfall for 10 years along with low weight (45 kg) and joint sounds suggests that a thorough medical evaluation is important.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Medical Evaluation:** Please consult a qualified doctor (preferably an endocrinologist or a general physician) for a full health check-up including:
   - Hormonal profile (testosterone, thyroid function)
   - Nutritional assessment
   - Joint examination and possibly imaging if needed

2. **Nutrition and Weight Gain:**
   - Focus on a balanced diet rich in proteins (eggs, dairy, legumes), healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates.
   - Consider consulting a dietitian for a personalized weight gain plan.
   - Regular strength training exercises can help build muscle mass.

3. **Nightfall Management:**
   - Avoid excessive stress and anxiety.
   - Maintain good sleep hygiene.
   - Avoid excessive stimulation before sleep.
   - There is no specific ""medicine"" universally recommended for nightfall; treatment depends on underlying causes.

4. **Joint Sounds:**
   - Joint sounds can be due to ligament or cartilage issues; a doctor can evaluate this.
   - Gentle exercises and avoiding strain may help.

5. **Avoid Self-Medication:**
   - Do not take medicines without prescription, especially multiple ayurvedic or allopathic drugs, as they may cause side effects.

Since you are concerned about your health and upcoming marriage, please prioritize a professional medical consultation to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs.

"CORRECT","True","Ive been having a sharp pain radiating from from my tooth up to my ear when I drink anything that is cold.I looked at my tooth and I noticed that I have what looks like a white vein on my back wisdom tooth. Is there anything that I could do for the pain>","Your symptoms—sharp pain radiating from a tooth to your ear when drinking cold liquids, along with the appearance of a white line or vein on your wisdom tooth—may indicate tooth sensitivity, possible enamel erosion, or early signs of tooth decay or infection.

Here are some steps you can take to manage the pain:

1. Avoid very cold or hot drinks to reduce sensitivity.
2. Use a toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth.
3. Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush and flossing daily.
4. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water to reduce any inflammation.
5. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help with pain and inflammation.

However, because the pain is sharp and radiates to your ear, and you notice an unusual white line on your wisdom tooth, it is important to see a dentist promptly. They can evaluate for possible cavities, infection, or other issues that may require treatment such as filling, root canal, or extraction.

If you develop swelling, fever, or severe pain, seek emergency dental care immediately.","tooth infection or gum infection surrounding wisdom tooth, possible impacted tooth, or tooth sensitivity/decay","WRONG","False","","The patient's symptoms of sharp, radiating pain from a tooth to the ear triggered by cold beverages, along with the white line-like appearance on the back wisdom tooth, suggest **dentin hypersensitivity** or **incipient dental caries** on the wisdom tooth.

However, considering the location (back wisdom tooth) and the white line-like appearance, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Occlusal or incipient dental caries (early enamel demineralization) on the wisdom tooth.**

- The white line-like appearance represents early enamel demineralization.
- Cold sensitivity and sharp pain are typical symptoms of early caries affecting dentin or enamel.
- Radiating pain to the ear is common with posterior tooth involvement due to nerve pathways.

"WRONG","False","my 55 year old downs syndrome brother has had about a dozen episodes over the past 3 years or so where he stiffens up and then goes limp and seems to have a very mild weakness on his right side for about 15 to 60 minutes.........he also is suffering some signs of dementia which is prominent in the family.........he also had a stroke at age 28 and another mild one 3 years ago...........he has recently had dvt s in both his legs and as he is not a candidate for blood thinners, had a mesh filter inserted into the vena cava.........is he having mini stokes or seizure activity........","Given your brother's history and symptoms, the episodes of stiffening followed by limpness and transient right-sided weakness lasting 15 to 60 minutes are concerning for transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), which are ""mini-strokes."" TIAs cause temporary neurological deficits due to brief interruptions in blood flow to the brain and often precede or indicate risk for full strokes.

Key points supporting TIAs:
- Transient weakness on one side (right side)
- Duration of symptoms (minutes to an hour)
- History of prior strokes
- Presence of dementia (vascular dementia can be related)
- Risk factors like DVT and vascular issues

Seizures can also cause stiffening and weakness, but post-ictal weakness (Todd's paralysis) usually lasts minutes to hours and is often associated with other seizure signs (altered consciousness, convulsions). The description of episodes and his vascular history makes TIAs more likely.

**Recommendation:**
- Urgent neurological evaluation is needed.
- Brain imaging (MRI/MRA) to assess for new ischemic changes or vascular abnormalities.
- Vascular studies (carotid ultrasound, echocardiogram) to identify embolic sources.
- EEG if seizures are suspected.
- Close monitoring and management of vascular risk factors.

Please seek prompt medical attention to prevent further strokes and optimize his care.","Seizures (Scar Epilepsy) likely due to previous stroke; Todd's palsy or accentuated residual weakness","CORRECT","True","","Key clinical points to consider:

- Patient with Down syndrome and prior strokes.
- Episodes characterized by initial stiffening followed by limpness and mild right-sided weakness lasting 15-60 minutes.
- Multiple episodes over 3 years.
- Signs of dementia.
- Recent bilateral deep vein thrombosis and IVC filter placement.
- Question: Are these episodes transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or seizures?

**Analysis:**

1. **Episode description:**  
   - Initial stiffening suggests tonic activity.  
   - Followed by limpness and weakness lasting 15-60 minutes.  
   - Duration longer than typical TIA (usually <1 hour, often minutes).  
   - Post-ictal weakness (Todd’s paralysis) can last minutes to hours and cause focal weakness after a seizure.

2. **Differential diagnosis:**  
   - **TIA:** Usually sudden onset focal neurological deficits lasting minutes to less than 24 hours, typically without preceding stiffening or tonic activity.  
   - **Focal seizures with post-ictal paralysis (Todd’s paresis):** Can present with initial tonic stiffening, followed by weakness lasting minutes to hours.  
   - **Complex partial seizures:** May have motor manifestations and post-ictal confusion or weakness.

3. **Down syndrome and dementia:**  
   - Increased risk of epilepsy, especially with dementia and prior strokes.  
   - Stroke history increases risk of seizures.

4. **DVT and IVC filter:**  
   - Suggests hypercoagulable state or immobility, but less relevant to episode characterization.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
These episodes are **focal seizures with post-ictal Todd’s paresis**, not TIAs.

**Rationale:**  
- The initial stiffening is characteristic of seizure activity.  
- The subsequent weakness lasting up to an hour fits Todd’s paralysis.  
- Multiple episodes over years favor seizures rather than recurrent TIAs.  
- History of stroke and dementia increases seizure risk.

**Recommendation:**  
- EEG to confirm epileptiform activity.  
- Neurology referral for seizure management.  
- Imaging to rule out new ischemic events.

Should I rush him to the hospital? Normally I wouldn t go to the hospital unless the fever reaches 104 but I m just concern because he had a TB done yesterday","A high fever of 102-103°F after a TB test is uncommon but can happen due to an immune response or unrelated infection. However, since your oldest son now has a high fever, you should monitor him closely for other symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting, severe headache, rash, or lethargy.

You should seek emergency care immediately if he:
- Has difficulty breathing or chest pain
- Becomes very drowsy or unresponsive
- Has a seizure
- Has a stiff neck or severe headache
- Shows signs of dehydration (very dry mouth, no urination)

If none of these are present, you can manage the fever at home with fever reducers (like acetaminophen or ibuprofen) and ensure he stays hydrated. However, if the fever persists beyond 24 hours, worsens, or you are very concerned, it is best to contact your doctor promptly or go to the hospital for evaluation.

This can be related to chronic migraine but also suggests underlying vascular issues affecting brain circulation.

Key points:
- Foci of ischemia = small areas of reduced blood supply.
- White matter changes = often related to small vessel disease or chronic ischemia.
- Low blood circulation in the brain = may contribute to her severe headaches and neurological symptoms.

This situation requires careful evaluation by a neurologist or stroke specialist. Treatment typically involves:
1. Controlling vascular risk factors: managing blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol.
2. Medications to improve blood flow or prevent clotting (antiplatelets) if indicated.
3. Optimizing migraine management with preventive therapies.
4. Lifestyle changes: healthy diet, exercise, smoking cessation.

1. **Ongoing Infection or Resistant Organism:** The infection may not be fully eradicated, or the bacteria could be resistant to the antibiotics used.
2. **Non-infectious Inflammation:** Conditions like fibromyalgia and occipital neuralgia are not typically associated with elevated WBC, but Cushing disease can alter immune response and inflammation.
3. **Other Causes:** Chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, or even hematologic conditions can cause elevated WBC and neutrophils.
4. **Medication Effects:** Some medications, including steroids used in Cushing disease, can affect WBC counts.

Given your complex medical history, it is important to:

- Reassess the diagnosis and consider alternative or additional infections.
- Evaluate for other inflammatory or hematologic conditions.
- Review current medications and their effects on blood counts.
- Consult with your healthcare provider or an infectious disease specialist for further workup, including cultures, imaging, and possibly bone marrow evaluation.

"CORRECT","True","I think I may have pulled a muscle or two at work I repeat lifting motions 8 hours a day.

Today though any solid food I swallow especially bread causes what feels like a muscle spasm and pain in that area only what do you think it may be?","Your symptoms of throbbing and burning pain along both sides of your spine near the shoulder blades, especially after repetitive lifting, suggest muscle strain or possible muscle spasms in the upper back muscles. However, the new symptom of pain or spasm triggered by swallowing solid food, particularly bread, is concerning and less typical for simple muscle strain.

This swallowing-related pain could indicate involvement of structures near the esophagus or nerves in that area, such as:

- Esophageal irritation or spasm
- Referred pain from cervical spine or nerve impingement
- Possible inflammation of muscles involved in swallowing

Given the combination of musculoskeletal pain and swallowing-related symptoms, it is important to get a thorough evaluation. I recommend:

- Seeing a healthcare provider promptly for a physical exam
- Possibly imaging (X-ray, MRI) to assess spine and soft tissues
- Evaluation by ENT or gastroenterology if swallowing symptoms persist or worsen

In the meantime, avoid heavy lifting, use heat or ice for muscle pain, and consider over-the-counter pain relief if no contraindications. If you develop difficulty swallowing, breathing problems, or severe pain, seek emergency care.

- Repetitive lifting causing bilateral paraspinal pain in the scapular region (common in muscle strain or myofascial pain syndrome).
- Pain triggered by swallowing solids (dysphagia-associated pain) localized to the same area is unusual for simple muscle strain and may indicate involvement of esophageal spasm or referred pain from esophageal irritation.

Given his advanced dementia, COPD/emphysema, lung cancer, recent pneumonia, and oxygen needs, his overall condition is quite fragile. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Dementia and Care Needs:** Stage 5-6 dementia means significant cognitive and functional decline, often requiring close supervision to prevent falls, ensure medication adherence, and manage daily activities safely. Unsteadiness increases fall risk, supporting the doctor's recommendation for 24/7 care or nursing home placement.

2. **Oxygen and Lung Status:** Fluctuating oxygen requirements indicate unstable lung function. Pneumonia recovery can be slow, especially with underlying lung disease. Reducing oxygen from 3L to 1.5L is a positive sign but still suggests compromised respiratory status.

3. **SBRT Treatment Considerations:** SBRT for stage 1 lung cancer is often aimed at local control and potentially curative, but in someone with multiple comorbidities and frailty, the risks and benefits must be carefully weighed. Interrupting treatment due to pneumonia is common, and resuming depends on his recovery and overall goals of care.

4. **Decision on Continuing Treatment:** Since the cancer is early stage but your stepdad has significant other health issues, the oncology team should discuss whether completing SBRT will meaningfully improve survival or quality of life. If treatment is unlikely to be curative or may worsen his condition, focusing on comfort and supportive care might be preferable.

**Recommendations:**
- Discuss with his oncologist and pulmonologist about the risks and benefits of continuing SBRT given his current health.
- Consider a comprehensive geriatric or palliative care assessment to guide care goals.
- Support the need for 24/7 supervision to ensure safety given his dementia and unsteadiness.
- Explore nursing home or home health care options to relieve caregiver burden and provide appropriate care.

What;s going on?Sharon","Sharon, your symptoms of severe cramping in the lower right abdomen, occurring monthly and sometimes accompanied by a visible bulge in the lower right groin, suggest the possibility of an inguinal hernia. The bulge you see is characteristic of a hernia, where abdominal contents protrude through a weak spot in the abdominal wall. The pain and cramping could be due to intermittent hernia incarceration or irritation.

Given your age and the chronic nature of symptoms, it is important to have a thorough physical examination by a healthcare provider, ideally a general surgeon. Imaging such as an abdominal and groin ultrasound or CT scan may help confirm the diagnosis if the hernia is not obvious on exam.

Your gynecological ultrasound being normal helps exclude gynecological causes. The use of valium and oxycodone may relieve muscle spasm and pain but does not treat the underlying cause.

I recommend you see a surgeon promptly for evaluation and management to prevent complications such as hernia strangulation.

While anxiety can cause many physical symptoms including chest sensations, twitching, and adrenaline-like feelings, the combination of left-sided chest pain and arm symptoms raises concern for a possible heart-related issue, such as angina or other cardiac problems.

**Important:** Chest pain with radiation to the arm and associated symptoms should be evaluated urgently to rule out heart problems.

**What to do:**
- Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:
  - Chest pain lasting more than a few minutes
  - Shortness of breath
  - Sweating, nausea, or dizziness
  - Weakness or numbness in the arm or face

- If symptoms are mild but persistent, see a healthcare provider promptly for a thorough evaluation including:
  - Physical exam
  - ECG (heart tracing)
  - Blood tests
  - Possibly imaging or gastroenterology evaluation for abdominal pain

Do not ignore these symptoms. If in doubt, go to the emergency room to ensure your heart is safe.","Anxiety (with possible GERD); cardiac cause to be ruled out","WRONG","False","","The combination of symptoms—prickly and aching sensations on the left chest, electric-like pains radiating down the left arm, occasional left eye twitching, central abdominal pain after eating, and a sensation resembling adrenaline in the stomach—suggests a complex clinical picture.

Key considerations:

1. **Cardiac causes:** Left chest pain with radiation to the left arm raises concern for angina or myocardial ischemia. However, the prickly sensation and electric-like pains are less typical for classic angina, which is usually described as pressure or squeezing.

2. **Neurological causes:** Electric-like pains down the left arm and twitching of the left eye suggest possible nerve irritation or neuropathy, such as cervical radiculopathy or a neurological disorder.

3. **Gastrointestinal causes:** Central abdominal pain after eating suggests possible gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or functional dyspepsia.

4. **Anxiety or autonomic symptoms:** The sensation of adrenaline in the stomach and twitching could be related to anxiety or autonomic nervous system activation.

**Most likely diagnosis:**  
Given the combination of chest and arm symptoms, the priority is to rule out cardiac ischemia. However, the presence of neurological symptoms (electric pains, twitching) and abdominal pain after eating suggests a multifactorial issue.

- If cardiac causes are excluded by ECG, cardiac enzymes, and imaging, the symptoms may be due to **cervical radiculopathy** (nerve root irritation causing chest and arm pain) combined with **gastric pathology** (e.g., gastritis or peptic ulcer) causing abdominal pain.
- The twitching and adrenaline-like sensation may be related to **anxiety or a neurological disorder**.

**Recommendation:**  
Urgent cardiac evaluation to exclude ischemia. If negative, neurological assessment (including cervical spine imaging) and gastroenterological evaluation (endoscopy) are warranted.

**Summary:**  
Most likely diagnosis is **cervical radiculopathy with concurrent gastrointestinal disorder (e.g., gastritis or peptic ulcer disease)**, pending exclusion of cardiac ischemia.","Anxiety (with possible GERD); cardiac cause to be ruled out","False","False","True","False","False","False","False","True","True","False","False","The combination of symptoms—prickly and aching sensations on the left chest, electric-like pains radiating down the left arm, occasional left eye twitching, central abdominal pain after eating, and a sensation resembling adrenaline in the stomach—suggests a complex clinical picture.

"CORRECT","True","i am having pain in my left testicle and groin. I have been to emergency twice. I have had two ultra sounds done. One ultrasound found an iguinal hernia and another found a Varicocele. Also found inflamation in the Epididitmis. hence the antibiotic i think. i had a surgery done where they went in through my belly button with a camera and the uroloigist said that they felt neither was in need for sugery. I have been on antibiotics for 11 days already but the pain is still there. The pain is somewhat tolerable if i laydown and do nothing but never goes away.","Your symptoms of persistent left testicular and groin pain, along with findings of an inguinal hernia, varicocele, and epididymitis inflammation, suggest a complex situation. Since you have already had two ultrasounds, surgery (likely diagnostic laparoscopy), and 11 days of antibiotics without significant pain relief, here are some important considerations:

1. **Epididymitis**: Sometimes inflammation can persist despite antibiotics, especially if the infection is resistant or if there is an underlying issue like chronic epididymitis or post-infectious inflammation.

2. **Varicocele**: Usually causes a dull ache but rarely severe pain. It often does not require surgery unless symptomatic and confirmed as the pain source.

3. **Inguinal Hernia**: If small and asymptomatic, it may not require surgery, but hernias can cause discomfort.

4. **Other causes**: Chronic pain syndromes, nerve irritation, or referred pain from the back or pelvis can mimic these symptoms.

**Recommendations:**

- Follow up urgently with your urologist or a specialist pain clinic for reassessment.
- Consider further imaging or tests to rule out complications like abscess or testicular ischemia.
- Pain management strategies may be needed, including anti-inflammatory medications or nerve pain treatments.
- If symptoms worsen (increased swelling, fever, severe pain), seek emergency care immediately.

Persistent pain after appropriate treatment warrants close specialist follow-up to tailor further management.","epididymitis (epididymal infection), possible residual pain post-hernia/varicocele, possible testicular/prostatic involvement","WRONG","False","","The patient's presentation includes:

- Left testicular and groin pain
- Ultrasound findings of inguinal hernia and varicocele
- Epididymitis treated with antibiotics for 11 days
- Laparoscopic evaluation showing no need for surgical intervention on hernia or varicocele
- Persistent, continuous, somewhat tolerable pain at rest and lying down

Given that the hernia and varicocele were deemed not surgically significant and the epididymitis has been treated without resolution of pain, the most likely diagnosis is **chronic orchialgia (chronic testicular pain)**.

Chronic orchialgia is defined as testicular pain lasting more than 3 months, often without a clear surgical cause after evaluation. It can persist despite treatment of identifiable conditions like epididymitis or varicocele.

"CORRECT","True","hai sir, my mother age was nearly 50 years and from last year she was often imbalance while walking. and her voice also ecoming unclear.we have consulted many doctors. and they advised as due to weakness. today back whan we consulted neuroogist, after ct scan told it was due to Mild diffuse cerebral atrophy . can u please explain what is mild cerebral atrophy. can we cure it. and can my mother walk normally again. please explain","Hello, I understand your concern about your mother's condition.

**Mild diffuse cerebral atrophy** means there is a slight, widespread loss of brain tissue (shrinkage) in the brain. This can happen due to aging, or other causes like chronic medical conditions, or neurological diseases. It can affect balance, coordination, and speech, which might explain your mother's symptoms of imbalance and unclear voice.

**Is it curable?**  
Cerebral atrophy itself is usually not reversible, especially if related to aging or chronic conditions. However, the progression can sometimes be slowed or managed depending on the underlying cause.

**Can she walk normally again?**  
Improvement depends on the cause and severity. Physical therapy, balance training, and addressing any treatable factors (like vitamin deficiencies, stroke, or other conditions) can help improve mobility and reduce falls.

**What to do next?**  
- Follow the neurologist’s advice carefully.  
- Consider rehabilitation therapies (physiotherapy, speech therapy).  
- Manage any other health issues (like blood pressure, diabetes).  
- Ensure a safe environment to prevent falls.

If you want, I can help explain more about possible treatments or suggest questions to ask your neurologist.","Diffuse cerebral atrophy","WRONG","False","","The patient's symptoms of progressive imbalance (ataxia) and unclear (dysarthric) voice over a year, along with mild diffuse cerebral atrophy on CT, suggest a neurodegenerative process affecting coordination and speech.

Most likely diagnosis: **Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)** or another form of **cerebellar degeneration**.

Rationale:
- Progressive imbalance and unclear speech point to cerebellar dysfunction.
- Mild diffuse cerebral atrophy supports neurodegeneration.
- The gradual progression over a year fits a degenerative ataxia rather than an acute or vascular cause.
- Weakness was initially suspected but is less consistent with the main symptoms.

Further evaluation with MRI, genetic testing, and detailed neurological exam would help confirm the diagnosis and subtype.","Diffuse cerebral atrophy","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","The patient's symptoms of progressive imbalance (ataxia) and unclear (dysarthric) voice over a year, along with mild diffuse cerebral atrophy on CT, suggest a neurodegenerative process affecting coordination and speech.
