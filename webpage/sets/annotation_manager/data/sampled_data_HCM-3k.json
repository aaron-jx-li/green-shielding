As per your complaint lump on the jawline along with other symptoms of vomiting, fever, migrant, nausea and dizziness are indicative of infection. It can be due to a deeply infected tooth leading to formation of pus below the root tips of the tooth and accumulation of pus in soft tissues can lead to swelling. When the infection by some way enters the blood it can cause septicemia and generalized features of infection as you have. If the lump is below the jaw line it can be an inflamed and swollen lymph node which is also a sign of infection in any part of the body either near or distant. I would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the problem. In case of infected tooth antibiotics, painkillers and treatment of the tooth either by root canal treatment or extraction can be relieving. In case of swollen lymph node the curing of infection by antibiotic treatment can provide relief. To reduce fever Tylenol can be taken. Anti emetics like Avoid can help in reducing vomiting.

Decrease triggers for her wheeze or fast breathing. Avoid the following: - Scarlatti/incense -perfume -face powder -dusting or sweeping near the baby - pet hairs -cockroaches -soft toys 3. Wash her bedsheets weekly in hot water to get rid of dust mites which will cause frequent wheezing4. Clean AC filters once in 10 days5.

All these factors predisposes patient to bleeding with decreased clotting ability. Although heparin is given during dialysis but all these are applied by trained staff by measurement.

Wait, repeat BChatDoctor in about a week and perform another scan with the new resultsLevels fall, no GS on scan: miscarriageLevels rise, duplicate and GS seen: Sublevels rise but do not duplicate or reach about 2000, no GS is seen: considering EP and new levels are measured and scan performed about a week later if more than 2000 units are measured, and no sac is seen, I would consider / perform a laparoscopy", "reference_diagnosis": "Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL); possible early intrauterine pregnancy, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy", "factors": {"has_worried_tone": false, "mentions_urgency_or_severity": false, "mentions_specific": false, "prior_belief_high_confidence": false, "asks_for_list": false, "asks_for_management_or_treatment": false, "contains_irrelevant_details": false, "missing_objective_data": false, "missing_time_course": false, "multi_turn_like_context": false, "ambiguous_or_unstructured_question_format": false}, "extracted": {"demographics": [], "S": ["cramping", "bleeding bright red blood (Monday night, stopped Tuesday)", "tiredness", "frequent urination", "metal mouth", "increased appetite"], "O": ["positive home pregnancy test (Saturday, Sept 11th)", "serum ChatDoctor test negative (Monday after Sept 11th)", "positive home pregnancy test (after negative serum test)", "ED visit (Tuesday, Sept 14th)", "ChatDoctor level at ED: 7", "repeat Beta ChatDoctor requested (Tuesday after ED visit)", "positive home pregnancy test (over the weekend after ED visit)", "labs on Tuesday, Sept 21st: ChatDoctor increased from 7 to 101", "gynecology appointment on Sept 29th", "ultrasound on Sept 29th: no gestational sac or signs of pregnancy", "repeat ChatDoctor on Sept 29th: levels increased to 204"]}, "ground_truth_space_majority": {"plausible_set": ["Pregnancy of unknown location", "Early intrauterine pregnancy", "Ectopic pregnancy", "Early pregnancy loss (miscarriage)", "Biochemical (chemical) pregnancy", "Gestational trophoblastic disease", "Non-viable intrauterine pregnancy"], "highly_likely_set": ["Ectopic pregnancy", "Pregnancy of unknown location", "Non-viable intrauterine pregnancy"], "cannot_miss_set": ["Ectopic pregnancy"], "highly_likely_evidence": {"Ectopic pregnancy": ["ultrasound on Sept 29th: no gestational sac or signs of pregnancy", "repeat ChatDoctor on Sept 29th: levels increased to 204", "cramping"], "Pregnancy of unknown location": ["ultrasound on Sept 29th: no gestational sac or signs of pregnancy", "repeat ChatDoctor on Sept 29th: levels increased to 204", "bleeding bright red blood (Monday night, stopped Tuesday)"], "Non-viable intrauterine pregnancy": ["repeat ChatDoctor on Sept 29th: levels increased to 204", "bleeding bright red blood (Monday night, stopped Tuesday)", "labs on Tuesday, Sept 21st: ChatDoctor increased from 7 to 101"]}, "cannot_miss_evidence": {"Ectopic pregnancy": ["ultrasound on Sept 29th: no gestational sac or signs of pregnancy", "repeat ChatDoctor on Sept 29th: levels increased to 204", "bleeding bright red blood (Monday night, stopped Tuesday)"]}}, "index": 1503}, {"__idx": 2247, "raw_input": "I have shortness of breath esp when active.

Again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. ET - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on Day 13. Collection in POD was nil, which is normal. Now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. By day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. By day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. Generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. This is the normal studyHowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. That is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. Anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.POD (Polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. You need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for POD to rule out the cause of this follicular study. Also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). In case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21.
