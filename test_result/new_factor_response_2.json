Two surgical attempts to remove the mass were made, but the tumor was not excised because of concerns about causing more damage. Imaging including MRI and PET scan were performed.

The patient has a five-year history of muscle pain and fatigue with no definitive diagnosis. Laboratory results show a low positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), positive anti-Smith antibody, and positive MTHFR mutation. Recent complete blood count is normal aside from the ANA findings. The patient has experienced unexplained hematuria; bladder imaging and cystoscopy revealed no abnormalities. The patient's mother also has a history of similar hematuria. The patient takes vitamin B12 and folic acid daily and completed a short course of low-dose prednisone four weeks prior for back inflammation. The patient questions whether the bruising might be related to an autoimmune condition, the influence of MTHFR mutation, or the effects of prior prednisone use. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

The impression notes postsurgical changes from C5-7 ACDF with multilevel degenerative disc disease without significant canal stenosis and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing at C5-6 due to uncovertebral hypertrophy.

Follow-up MRI showed resolution of the original tumors but revealed 11 new small brain lesions, which were again treated with Gamma Knife. He then started chemotherapy for lung cancer. Fourteen days after the second chemotherapy round, he presented with severe fatigue and low energy; labs showed hemoglobin of 5.9 requiring blood transfusion. He experienced headaches treated with intravenous dexamethasone. During hospitalization, he became disoriented, confused, with unclear speech and poor understanding. Despite this, he was discharged with continued dexamethasone for headaches. Subsequent MRI showed 8 new brain lesions. The question is whether his confusion and forgetfulness are most likely due to dexamethasone side effects or brain tumor edema in specific brain regions. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
